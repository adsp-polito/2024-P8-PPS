Preferences for disease-related information and transitional skills among adolescents with congenital heart disease in the early transitional stage.,de Hosson M; De Groote K; Wynendaele H; Mosquera LM; Goossens E; De Backer J,"PURPOSE: The transition towards adult-focused healthcare comprises a complex process requiring careful, individualized guidance of adolescents with congenital heart disease (CHD). Detailed data on their preferences regarding disease-related information and acquirable transitional skills are mostly lacking. We examined the preferences of CHD adolescents in the early transition stage. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed with adolescents recruited from a transition program. Two questionnaires assessing needs for information and transitional skills were used. Only questionnaires completed in the early transition stage were included. RESULTS: Forty-nine adolescents participated (mean age 15.9 ± 1.2 years, 43% girls). 59% requested information about their heart and previous and/or future surgeries/interventions, 45% about sports and medication, and a maximum of 27% about psychosocial topics. More girls than boys requested surgical information (76% versus 46%; p = 0.04). Adolescents with severely complex CHD more often requested information about medication than those with moderately complex CHD (63% versus 28%; p = 0.02). Older adolescents were less likely to request surgical information (OR = 0.53; 95%CI [0.26-0.88]; p = 0.03). Up to 83% of the adolescents perceived their skills as insufficient, but less than 14% was interested in acquiring skills.    Conclusion: Adolescents were mainly interested in medical topics, followed by lifestyle information. The informational needs tended to decrease with age. Timely gauging individual needs and delivering information, ideally in the early teens, appear important when providing person-tailored transitional care in CHD. Paradoxically, although the transitional skills were low-perceived, there was limited motivation to improve them. This paradox requires further investigation to better tailor transition interventions.     Clinical trial registration: Not applicable. WHAT IS KNOWN: • Transition towards adult life and care requires careful patient guidance. A person-tailored approach is strongly encouraged. However, details on preferences regarding disease-related information and transitional skills are scarce in adolescents with CHD. WHAT IS NEW: • This study showed that adolescents with CHD in early transition mainly need medical-related information. Their informational needs tend to decrease with age necessitating timely gauging for interest and delivering information. Adolescents report a low need to acquire transitional skills despite low self-esteemed skills levels.",2023,Sep,Eur J Pediatr,182,9,3917-3927,,10.1007/s00431-023-05020-1,37351648,#930,deHosson 2023,,,0
Advance Care Planning in South Korea.,Kim YJ; Kim SH,"South Korea is an Asian country with a very low birth rate and a large elderly population. Nearly half of deaths are in the elderly over the age of 80, and cancer is the leading cause of all deaths. As the aging population increases, interest in end-of-life (EOL) care and quality of death is growing, but South Korea is one of the Asian countries that traditionally feels burdened by discussing death openly. In particular, even when a person is suffering from an incurable disease and is about to die, it is customary for the family members to make decisions without directly informing the patient of the disease status or discussing life-sustaining treatment (LST). However, due to a series of social events, the importance of individual autonomy, good death, discontinuation of LSTs, and advance care planning (ACP) gradually spread, and eventually the Life-Sustaining Treatment Decisions Act was implemented in 2018. With the enactment of this law, patients' autonomy was enhanced in a short period of time, and a legal basis was established to discontinue LST at the EOL. However, there are still many areas to be improved, and it is fundamentally necessary to spread the concept of 'ACP' within society.",2023,Aug,Z Evid Fortbild Qual Gesundhwes,180,,68-73,,10.1016/j.zefq.2023.04.014,37353427,#1010,Kim 2023,,,0
Stakeholders' preferences for the design and delivery of virtual care services: A systematic review of discrete choice experiments.,Vo LK; Allen MJ; Cunich M; Thillainadesan J; McPhail SM; Sharma P; Wallis S; McGowan K; Carter HE,"This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence from discrete choice experiments (DCEs) eliciting preferences for virtual models of care, as well as to assess the quality of those DCEs and compare the relative preferences for different stakeholder groups. Articles were included if published between January 2010 and December 2022. Data were synthesised narratively, and attributes were assessed for frequency, significance, and relative importance using a semi-quantitative approach. Overall, 21 studies were included encompassing a wide range of virtual care modalities, with the most common setting being virtual consultations for outpatient management of chronic conditions. A total of 135 attributes were identified and thematically classified into six categories: service delivery, service quality, technical aspects, monetary aspects, health provider characteristics and health consumer characteristics. Attributes related to service delivery were most frequently reported but less highly ranked. Service costs were consistently significant across all studies where they appeared, indicating their importance to the respondents. All studies examining health providers' preferences reported either system performance or professional endorsement attributes to be the most important. Substantial heterogeneity in attribute selection and preference outcomes were observed across studies reporting on health consumers' preferences, suggesting that the consideration of local context is important in the design and delivery of person-centred virtual care services. In general, the experimental design and analysis methods of included studies were clearly reported and justified. An improvement was observed in the quality of DCE design and analysis in recent years, particularly in the attribute development process. Given the continued growth in the use of DCEs within healthcare settings, further research is needed to develop a standardised approach for quantitatively synthesising DCE findings. There is also a need for further research on preferences for virtual care in post-pandemic contexts, where emerging evidence suggests that preferences may differ to those observed in pre-pandemic times.",2024,Jan,Soc Sci Med,340,,116459,,10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.116459,38048738,#513,Vo 2024,,,1
Discrete Choice Experiments in Health State Valuation: A Systematic Review of Progress and New Trends.,Wang H; Rowen DL; Brazier JE; Jiang L,"BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are increasingly used in health state valuation studies. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review updates the progress and new findings of DCE studies in the health state valuation, covering the period since the review of June 2018 to November 2022. The review reports the methods that are currently being used in DCE studies to value health and study design characteristics, and, for the first time, reviews DCE health state valuation studies published in the Chinese language. METHODS: English language databases PubMed and Cochrane, and Chinese language databases Wanfang and CNKI were searched using the self-developed search terms. Health state valuation or methodology study papers were included if the study used DCE data to generate a value set for a preference-based measure. Key information extracted included DCE study design strategies applied, methods for anchoring the latent coefficient on to a 0-1 QALY scale and data analysis methods. RESULTS: Sixty-five studies were included; one Chinese language publication and 64 English language publications. The number of health state valuation studies using DCE has rapidly increased in recent years and these have been conducted in more countries than prior to 2018. Wide usage of DCE with duration attributes, D-efficient design and models accounting for heterogeneity has continued in recent years. Although more methodological consensus has been found than in studies conducted prior to 2018, this consensus may be driven by valuation studies for common measures with an international protocol (the 'model' valuation research). Valuing long measures with well-being attributes attracted attention and more realistic design strategies (e.g., inconstant time preference, efficient design and implausible states design) were identified. However, more qualitative and quantitative methodology study is still necessary to evaluate the effect of those new methods. CONCLUSIONS: The use of DCEs in health state valuation continues to grow dramatically and the methodology progress makes the method more reliable and pragmatic. However, study design is driven by international protocols and method selection is not always justified. There is no gold standard for DCE design, presentation format or anchoring method. More qualitative and quantitative methodology study is recommended to evaluate the effect of new methods before researchers make methodology decisions.",2023,May,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,21,3,405-418,,10.1007/s40258-023-00794-9,36997744,#1276,Wang 2023,,,1
Improving methods of clinical practice guidelines: From guidelines to pathways to fast-and-frugal trees and decision analysis to develop individualised patient care.,Djulbegovic B; Hozo I; Cuker A; Guyatt G,"BACKGROUND: Current methods for developing clinical practice guidelines have several limitations: they are characterised by the ""black box"" operation-a process with defined inputs and outputs but an incomplete understanding of its internal workings; they have ""the integration problem""-a lack of framework for explicitly integrating factors such as patient preferences and trade-offs between benefits and harms; they generate one recommendation at a time that typically are not connected in a coherent analytical framework; and they apply to ""average"" patients, while clinicians and their patients seek advice tailored to individual circumstances. METHODS: We propose augmenting the current guideline development method by converting evidence-based pathways into fast-and-frugal decision trees (FFTs) and integrating them with generalised decision curve analysis to formulate clear, individualised management recommendations. RESULTS: We illustrate the process by developing recommendations for the management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). We converted evidence-based pathways for HIT, developed by the American Society of Hematology, into an FFT. Here, we consider only thrombotic complications and major bleeding. We leveraged the predictive potential of FFTs to compare the effects of argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) using generalised decision curve analysis. We found that DOACs were superior to other treatments if the FFT-predicted probability of HIT exceeded 3%. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed analytical framework connects guidelines, pathways, FFTs, and decision analysis, offering risk-tailored personalised recommendations and addressing current guideline development critiques.",2023,Dec,J Eval Clin Pract,,,,,10.1111/jep.13953,38073027,#573,Djulbegovic 2023,,,0
Interdisciplinary care of pediatric oncology patients: A survey of clinicians in Central America and the Caribbean.,Graetz DE; Chen Y; Devidas M; Antillon-Klussmann F; Fu L; Quintero K; Fuentes-Alabi SL; Gassant PY; Kaye EC; Baker JN; Rodriguez Galindo C; Mack JW,"BACKGROUND: Quality cancer care depends on interdisciplinary communication. This study explored the communication practices of interdisciplinary clinicians, the types of healthcare services for which they engage in interdisciplinary collaboration, and the association between interdisciplinary care and perceived quality of care, as well as job satisfaction. METHODS: We conducted a survey of interdisciplinary clinicians from cancer centers in Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, El Salvador, and Haiti. The survey included 68 items including previously validated tools and novel questions. RESULTS: Total 174 interdisciplinary clinicians completed the survey: nurses (n = 60), medical subspecialists (n = 35), oncologists (n = 22), psychosocial providers (n = 20), surgeons (n = 12), pathologists (n = 9), radiologists (n = 9), and radiation oncologists (n = 5). Oncologists reported daily communication with nurses (95%) and other oncologists (91%). While 90% of nurses reported daily communication with other nurses, only 66% reported daily communication with oncologists, and more than 50% of nurses reported never talking to pathologists, radiologists, radiation oncologists, or surgeons. Most clinicians described interdisciplinary establishment of cancer treatment goals and prognosis (84%), patient preferences (81%), and determination of first treatment modality (80%). Clinicians who described more interdisciplinary collaboration had higher job satisfaction (p = .04) and perceived a higher level of overall quality of care (p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians in these limited resource settings describe strong interdisciplinary collaboration contributing to higher job satisfaction and perceived quality of care. However, nurses in these settings reported more limited interdisciplinary communication and care. Additional studies are necessary to further define clinical roles on interdisciplinary care teams and their associations with patient outcomes.",2023,May,Pediatr Blood Cancer,70,5,e30244,,10.1002/pbc.30244,36788461,#1284,Graetz 2023,,,0

"Aortic valve replacement in non-elderly: the gap between reality, guidelines and evidence.",Geuens L; Van Hoof L; Van De Bruaene A; Rega F; Meuris B; Verbrugghe P,"OBJECTIVES: There are several treatment options for non-elderly adults (18-60 years) in need of aortic valve replacement (AVR): a mechanical or biological substitute, a homograft, the Ross procedure or nowadays even transcatheter aortic valve replacement. This study evaluated the current opinions and practices of cardiac surgeons and cardiologists concerning AVR strategies in this patient group. METHODS: A 43-item online survey was sent out to several scientific organizations, individual cardiac surgeons, cardiologists and residents/fellows worldwide. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two physicians from 33 different countries answered the survey. The UK (24%), Belgium (23%) and North America (22%) are best represented. A mechanical valve is the most frequently used substitute in non-elderly. With increasing patient age, the popularity of a biological valve increases. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement and the Ross procedure are each used in <10% of this cohort. Only 12% of the cardiac surgeons has experience with the Ross surgery. In 23%, the patient seems not to be involved in the decision on the type of valve substitute. CONCLUSIONS: The preferred surgical treatment for non-elderly patients in need of AVR differs widely. To enable a shared decision-making process including patient preferences, there is more need for collaboration between cardiac departments, as well as education and scientific research about patient-centred outcomes of the different AVR techniques.",2023,Nov,Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,64,5,,,10.1093/ejcts/ezad318,37756688,#717,Geuens 2023,,,0
Patient preferences in chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases potentially treated with biological drugs: discrete choice analysis using real-world data analysis.,Ginard-Vicens D; Tornero-Molina J; Fernández-Fuente-Bursón L; González Gómez ML; Moreno E; Salleras M; Guigini MA; Burniol-Garcia A; Crespo C,"OBJECTIVES: Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) represent a high burden due to their chronicity, high prevalence, and associated comorbidities. Chronic patients' preferences must be considered in IMIDs treatment and follow-up. The objective of this study was to further understand patient's preferences in private settings. METHODS: A literature review was performed to choose the most relevant criteria for patients. A D-efficient discrete choice experiment was designed to elicit preferences of adult patients with IMIDs and potential biological treatment prescription. Participants were collected from private practices (rheumatology, dermatology, and gastroenterology) from February to May 2022. Patients chose between option pairs, characterized by six health-care attributes, as well as monthly out-of-pocket drug price. Responses were analyzed through a conditional logit model. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients answered the questionnaire. The most frequent pathologies were Rheumatoid Arthritis (31%) and Psoriatic Arthritis (26%). The most relevant criteria were choosing the preferred physician (OR 2.25 [SD0.26]); reducing time until visit with specialist (OR 1.79 [SD0.20]), access through primary care (OR 1.60 [SD0.08]), and an increase in monthly out-of-pocket price from 100€ to 300€ (OR 0.55 [SD0.06]) and to 600€ (OR 0.08 [SD0.02]). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic IMIDs patients showed a preference toward a faster, personalized service, even with a trade-off in terms of out-of-pocket price.",2023,Jul-Dec,Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res,23,8,959-965,,10.1080/14737167.2023.2232109,37395007,#1095,Ginard-Vicens 2023,,,1
Discrete choice experiment versus swing-weighting: A head-to-head comparison of diabetic patient preferences for glucose-monitoring devices.,Whichello C; Smith I; Veldwijk J; de Wit GA; Rutten-van Molken MPMH; de Bekker-Grob EW,"INTRODUCTION: Limited evidence exists for how patient preference elicitation methods compare directly. This study compares a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and swing-weighting (SW) by eliciting preferences for glucose-monitoring devices in a population of diabetes patients. METHODS: A sample of Dutch adults with type 1 or 2 diabetes (n = 459) completed an online survey assessing their preferences for glucose-monitoring devices, consisting of both a DCE and a SW exercise. Half the sample completed the DCE first; the other half completed the SW first. For the DCE, the relative importance of the attributes of the devices was determined using a mixed-logit model. For the SW, the relative importance of the attributes was based on ranks and points allocated to the 'swing' from the worst to the best level of the attribute. The preference outcomes and self-reported response burden were directly compared between the two methods. RESULTS: Participants reported they perceived the DCE to be easier to understand and answer compared to the SW. Both methods revealed that cost and precision of the device were the most important attributes. However, the DCE had a 14.9-fold difference between the most and least important attribute, while the SW had a 1.4-fold difference. The weights derived from the SW were almost evenly distributed between all attributes. CONCLUSIONS: The DCE was better received by participants, and generated larger weight differences between each attribute level, making it the more informative method in our case study. This method comparison provides further evidence of the degree of method suitability and trustworthiness.",2023,,PLoS One,18,7,e0283926,,10.1371/journal.pone.0283926,37506078,#1038,Whichello 2023,,,1
Linking Patients' Goals and Priorities to Recommendations for Medication Changes in a Polypharmacy-Focused Structured Clinical Pathway.,Mangin D; Lamarche L; Freeman K; Ali A; Clark R; Shah N; Awan A; Langevin J; Parascandalo J; Dore Brown N; Jurcic-Vrataric J; Colwill K; Dragos S; Borhan S; Risdon C; Siu H; Farrell B; Trimble J,"Polypharmacy is associated with poorer health outcomes in older adults. It is challenging to minimize the harmful effects of medications while maximizing benefits of single-disease-focused recommendations. Integrating patient input can balance these factors. The objectives are to describe the goals, priorities, and preferences of participants asked about these in a structured process to polypharmacy, and to describe the extent that decision-making within the process mapped onto these, signaling a patient-centered approach. This is a single-group quasi-experimental study, nested within a feasibility randomized controlled trial. Patient goals and priorities were mapped to medication recommendations made during the intervention. Overall, there were 33 participants who reported 55 functional goals and 66 symptom priorities, and 16 participants reported unwanted medications. Overall, 154 recommendations for medication alterations occurred. Of those, 68 (44%) recommendations mapped to the individual's goals and priorities, whereas the rest were based on clinical judgment where no priorities were expressed. Our results signal this process supports a patient-centered approach: allowing conversations around goals and priorities in a structured process to polypharmacy should be integrated into subsequent medication decisions.",2023,,J Patient Exp,10,,23743735231174762,,10.1177/23743735231174762,37213440,#1234,Mangin 2023,,,0
Cancer Survivor Preferences for Models of Breast Cancer Follow-Up Care: Selecting Attributes for Inclusion in a Discrete Choice Experiment.,Kularatna S; Allen M; Hettiarachchi RM; Crawford-Williams F; Senanayake S; Brain D; Hart NH; Koczwara B; Ee C; Chan RJ,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It is critical to evaluate cancer survivors' preferences when developing follow-up care models to better address the needs of cancer survivors. This study was conducted to understand the key attributes of breast cancer follow-up care for use in a future discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey. METHODS: Key attributes of breast cancer follow-up care models were generated using a multi-stage, mixed-methods approach. Focus group discussions were conducted with cancer survivors and clinicians to generate a range of attributes of current and ideal follow-up care. These attributes were then prioritised using an online survey with survivors and healthcare providers. The DCE attributes and levels were finalised via an expert panel discussion based on the outcomes of the previous stages. RESULTS: Four focus groups were held, two with breast cancer survivors (n = 7) and two with clinicians (n = 8). Focus groups generated sixteen attributes deemed important for breast cancer follow-up care models. The prioritisation exercise was conducted with 20 participants (14 breast cancer survivors and 6 clinicians). Finally, the expert panel selected five attributes for a future DCE survey tool to elicit cancer survivors' preferences on breast cancer follow-up care. The final attributes included: the care team, allied health and supportive care, survivorship care planning, travel for appointments, and out-of-pocket costs. CONCLUSIONS: Attributes identified can be used in future DCE studies to elicit cancer survivors' preferences for breast cancer follow-up care. This strengthens the design and implementation of follow-up care programs that best suit the needs and expectations of breast cancer survivors.",2023,Jul,Patient,16,4,371-383,,10.1007/s40271-023-00631-0,37213062,#1110,Kularatna 2023,,,1
Expert Consensus for the Use of Outpatient Rehabilitation Visits After Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Delphi Study.,Graber J; Churchill L; Struessel T; O'Malley S; Bade M; Stevens-Lapsley J,"OBJECTIVE: There is no consensus for how to use rehabilitation visits after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We sought to develop expert recommendations for outpatient rehabilitation visit usage after TKA. DESIGN: Delphi study. METHODS: First, we developed a broad list of preliminary visit usage recommendations, which were specific to patients' recovery status (ie, slow, typical, or fast recovery) and time since surgery. We then invited 49 TKA experts to participate on a Delphi panel. During round 1, we surveyed panelists regarding their level of agreement with each preliminary recommendation. We conducted additional Delphi rounds as needed to build consensus, which we defined using the RAND/UCLA method. We updated the survey each round based on panelist feedback and responses from the previous round. RESULTS: Thirty panelists agreed to participate, and 29 panelists completed 2 Delphi rounds. The panel reached consensus on recommendations related to visit frequency, visit timing, and the use of telerehabilitation. The panel recommended that outpatient rehabilitation should begin within 1 week after surgery at a frequency of 2 times per week for the first postoperative month regardless of recovery status. The panel recommended different visit frequencies depending on the patient's recovery status for postoperative months 2 to 3. The panel agreed that telerehabilitation can be recommended for most patients after TKA, but not for patients recovering slowly. CONCLUSION: We used the Delphi process to develop expert recommendations for the use of outpatient rehabilitation visits after TKA. We envision these recommendations could help patients decide how to use visits based on their own preferences. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2023;53(9):1-9.

Racial Disparity in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Treatment and Survival in the United States.,Noureldin M; Rubenstein JH; Urias E; Berinstein JA; Cohen-Mekelburg S; Saini SD; Higgins PD; Waljee AK,"INTRODUCTION: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has a higher incidence and prevalence than esophageal adenocarcinoma among Black individuals in the United States. Black individuals have lower ESCC survival. These racial disparities have not been thoroughly investigated. We examined the disparity in treatment and survival stratified by ESCC stage at diagnosis. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried to identify patients with ESCC between 2000 and 2019. The identified cohort was divided into subgroups by race. Patient and cancer characteristics, treatment received, and survival rates were compared across the racial subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 23,768 patients with ESCC were identified. Compared with White individuals, Black individuals were younger and had more distant disease during diagnosis (distant disease: 26.7% vs 23.8%, P < 0.001). Black individuals had lower age-standardized 5-year survival for localized (survival % [95% confidence interval]: 19.3% [16-22.8] vs 27.6% [25.1-30.2]), regional (14.3% [12-16.7] vs 21.1% [19.6-22.7]), and distant (2.9% [1.9-4.1] vs 6.5% [5.5-7.5]) disease. Black individuals were less likely to receive chemotherapy (54.7% vs 57.5%, P = 0.001), radiation (58.5% vs 60.4%, P = 0.03), and surgery (11.4% vs 16.3%, P < 0.0001). DISCUSSION: Black individuals with ESCC have a lower survival rate than White individuals. This could be related to presenting at a later stage but also disparities in which treatments they receive even among individuals with the same stage of disease. To what extent these disparities in receipt of treatment is due to structural racism, social determinants of health, implicit bias, or patient preferences deserves further study.",2023,Dec,Am J Gastroenterol,,,,,10.14309/ajg.0000000000002606,37975573,#554,Noureldin 2023,,,0
Using MaxDiff Analysis to Elicit Patients' Treatment Preferences for Distal Radius Fractures in Patients Aged 60 Years and Older.,Phan A; Schloemann D; Calderon T; Hammert WC,"PURPOSE: The objective of our study was to determine how the attributes of surgical and nonsurgical distal radius fracture (DRF) treatments affect patient treatment preferences. METHODS: Two hundred fifty patients aged 60 years and older were contacted from a single-hand surgeon's practice, and 172 chose to participate. We built a series of best-worst scaling experiments for the MaxDiff analysis to determine the relative importance of treatment attributes. Hierarchical Bayes analysis was used to generate individual-level item scores (ISs) for each attribute that together have a total sum of 100. RESULTS: One hundred general hand clinic patients without a history of a DRF and 43 patients with a history of a DRF completed the survey. For the general hand clinic patients, the most important attributes to avoid when choosing a DRF treatment (in descending order) were the longer time to full recovery (IS, 24.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.4-26.3), longer time spent in a cast (IS, 22.8; 95% CI, 21.5-24.2), and higher complication rates (IS, 18.4; 95% CI, 16.9-19.8). Meanwhile, for patients with a history of a DRF, the most important attributes to avoid (in descending order) were a longer time to full recovery (IS, 25.6; 95% CI, 23.3-27.9), longer time spent in a cast (IS, 22.8; 95% CI, 19.9-25.7), and abnormal alignment of the radius on x-ray (IS, 18.3; 95% CI, 15.4-21.3). For both the groups, the least concerning attributes based on the IS were appearance-scar, appearance-bump, and the need for anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Eliciting patient preferences is a vital component of shared decision-making and advancing patient-centered care. As conceptualized in this MaxDiff analysis, when choosing a DRF treatment, patients mostly want to avoid a longer time to full recovery and a longer time in a cast, whereas patients have the least concern about appearance and need for anesthesia. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Eliciting patient preferences is a vital component of shared decision-making. Our results may provide guidance to surgeons in discussions on the relative benefits of surgical and nonsurgical DRF treatments, by quantifying the most and least important factors to patients.",2023,Jun,J Hand Surg Am,48,6,575-584,,10.1016/j.jhsa.2023.03.004,37029035,#1199,Phan 2023,,,1
Updated Immunotherapy for Gastric Cancer.,Narita Y; Muro K,"Gastric cancer treatments are evolving rapidly. For example, immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially those that target PD-1 or PD-L1, have long-term efficacy in a subset of gastric cancer patients, and are currently the first-line therapy. Immunotherapies approved for use in untreated gastric cancer patients include monotherapy and chemotherapy-immunotherapy combinations. Major clinical trials have reported efficacy and safety data suggesting that PD-L1 expression is important for regimen selection, although other biomarkers, clinicopathologic factors, and patient preference might also be relevant in other situations. Currently, several novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies are being assessed, which might refine the current treatment paradigm. In this review, we describe the current treatment regimens for patients with gastric cancer and detail the approach we use for the selection of first-line immunotherapy regimens.",2023,Apr,J Clin Med,12,7,,,10.3390/jcm12072636,37048719,#1342,Narita 2023,,,0
Factors that influence intensive care admission decisions for older people: A systematic review.,Foley C; Bloomer M; Hutchinson AM,"BACKGROUND: The population worldwide is rapidly ageing, and demand for intensive care is increasing. People aged 85 years and above, known as the oldest old, are particularly vulnerable to critical illness owing to the physiological effects of ageing. Evidence surrounding admission of the oldest old to the intensive care is limited. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to systematically and comprehensively review and synthesise the published research investigating factors that influence decisions to admit the oldest old to the intensive care unit. METHOD: This was a systematic review and narrative synthesis. Following a comprehensive search of CINAHL, Embase, and Medline databases, peer-reviewed primary research articles examining factors associated with admission or refusal to admit the oldest old to intensive care were selected. Data were extracted into tables and narratively synthesised. RESULTS: Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Three studies identified factors associated with admission such as greater premorbid self-sufficiency, patient preferences, alignment between patient and physicians' goals of treatment, age less than 85 years, and absence of cancer, or previous intensive care admission. Factors associated with refusal to admit were identified in all six studies and included limited or no bed availability, level of ICU physician experience, patients being deemed too ill or too well to benefit, and older age. CONCLUSIONS: Published research investigating decision-making about admission or refusal to admit the oldest old to the intensive care unit is scant. The ageing population and increasing demand for intensive care unit resources has amplified the need for greater understanding of factors that influence decisions to admit or refuse admission of the oldest old to the intensive care unit. Such knowledge may inform guidelines regarding complex practice decisions about admission of the oldest old to an intensive care unit.

Analysis based on discrete choice experiment.,Peng X; Hui-Qin L; Xia H,"PURPOSES: The purposes of this discrete choice experiment are as follows: (1) quantify the relevant characteristics that may affect the follow-up selection of gastric cancer patients after surgery and (2) explore the differences in follow-up preferences of gastric cancer patients at different stages and reveal the change trend of preferences over time, thereby providing references for the formulation and optimization of follow-up strategies. METHODS: A survey instrument that was developed using the design principle of a discrete choice experiment investigated gastric cancer patients on the day of discharge, and at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after discharge. In Stata 15.0, a mixed logit model was used to explore the preferences of gastric cancer patients after surgery at different stages, the willingness to pay was calculated, and the NLCOM command was used to simulate the follow-up uptake rates of different attribute levels at different stages. RESULTS: On the day of discharge, and 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after discharge, the most important attribute levels of gastric cancer patients after surgery were ""thoroughness-very thorough,"" ""method-face-to-face,"" ""thoroughness-very thorough,"" and ""provider-specialist nurse,"" respectively, and patients were willing to pay more for these services. Patients' preference for the attribute level ""very thorough"" decreased over time, while their preferences for ""specialist doctors"" as follow-up providers remained relatively stable. Furthermore, the attribute levels with the greatest effect on receiving the baseline follow-up program varied across stages. CONCLUSION: The gastric cancer patients' preferences for follow-up change over time, and the time factor should be considered when developing follow-up strategies.",2023,Mar,Support Care Cancer,31,4,234,,10.1007/s00520-023-07699-2,36964800,#1402,Peng 2023,,,1
Urological Guidelines for Kidney Stones: Overview and Comprehensive Update.,Akram M; Jahrreiss V; Skolarikos A; Geraghty R; Tzelves L; Emilliani E; Davis NF; Somani BK,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based guidelines are published by urological organisations for various conditions, including urolithiasis. In this paper, we provide guidance on the management of kidney stone disease (KSD) and compare the American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urologists (EAU) guidelines. METHODS: We evaluate and appraise the evidence and grade of recommendation provided by the AUA and EAU guidelines on urolithiasis (both surgical and medical management). RESULTS: Both the AUA and EAU guidelines provide guidance on the type of imaging, treatment options, and medical therapies and advice on specific patient groups, such as in paediatrics and pregnancy. While the guidelines are generally aligned and based on evidence, some subtle differences exist in the recommendations, but both are generally unanimous for the majority of the principles of management. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that the guidelines should undergo regular updates based on recently published material, and while these guidelines provide a framework, treatment plans should still be personalised, respecting patient preferences, surgical expertise, and various other individual factors, to offer the best outcome for kidney stone patients.",2024,Feb,J Clin Med,13,4,,,10.3390/jcm13041114,38398427,#362,Akram 2024,,,0
Development of vaccines for Chagas disease (CRUZIVAX): stakeholders' preferences and potential impacts on healthcare.,Ramponi F; Aerts C; Sartor P; Pinazo MJ; Freilij H; Guzmán CA; Malchiodi E; Sicuri E,"A vaccine for Chagas disease does not currently exist. This study aims to inform the development of two vaccines for the prevention and treatment of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and guide their pre-clinical phase up to clinical phase I.

Study protocol of a randomized controlled trial of fistula vs. graft arteriovenous vascular access in older adults with end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis: the AV access trial.,Murea M; Gardezi AI; Goldman MP; Hicks CW; Lee T; Middleton JP; Shingarev R; Vachharajani TJ; Woo K; Abdelnour LM; Bennett KM; Geetha D; Kirksey L; Southerland KW; Young CJ; Brown WM; Bahnson J; Chen H; Allon M,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with hemodialysis requires surgical creation of an arteriovenous (AV) vascular access-fistula (AVF) or graft (AVG)-to avoid (or limit) the use of a central venous catheter (CVC). AVFs have long been considered the first-line vascular access option, with AVGs as second best. Recent studies have suggested that, in older adults, AVGs may be a better strategy than AVFs. Lacking evidence from well-powered randomized clinical trials, integration of these results into clinical decision making is challenging. The main objective of the AV Access Study is to compare, between the two types of AV access, clinical outcomes that are important to patients, physicians, and policy makers. METHODS: This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in adults ≥ 60 years old receiving chronic hemodialysis via a CVC. Eligible participants must have co-existing cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or diabetes mellitus; and vascular anatomy suitable for placement of either type of AV access. Participants are randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to a strategy of AVG or AVF creation. An estimated 262 participants will be recruited across 7 healthcare systems, with average follow-up of 2 years. Questionnaires will be administered at baseline and semi-annually. The primary outcome is the rate of CVC-free days per 100 patient-days. The primary safety outcome is the cumulative incidence of vascular access (CVC or AV access)-related severe infections-defined as access infections that lead to hospitalization or death. Secondary outcomes include access-related healthcare costs and patients' experiences with vascular access care between the two treatment groups. DISCUSSION: In the absence of studies using robust and unbiased research methodology to address vascular access care for hemodialysis patients, clinical decisions are limited to inferences from observational studies. The goal of the AV Access Study is to generate evidence to optimize vascular access care, based on objective, age-specific criteria, while incorporating goals of care and patient preference for vascular access type in clinical decision-making. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is being conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration, and has been approved by the central institutional review board (IRB) of Wake Forest University Health Sciences (approval number: 00069593) and local IRB of each participating clinical center; and was registered on Nov 27, 2020, at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04646226).",2023,Feb,BMC Nephrol,24,1,43,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT04646226,10.1186/s12882-023-03086-5,36829135,#1505,Murea 2023,,,0
Deactivation of Left Ventricular Assist Devices at the End of Life: Narrative Review and Ethical Framework.,Zaidi D; Kirkpatrick JN; Fedson SE; Hull SC,"Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have become an increasingly common advanced therapy in patients with severe symptomatic heart failure. Their unique nature in prolonging life through incorporation into the circulatory system raises ethical questions regarding patient identity and values, device ontology, and treatment categorization; approaching requests for LVAD deactivation requires consideration of these factors, among others. To that end, clinicians would benefit from a deeper understanding of: 1) the history and nature of LVADs; 2) the wider context of device deactivation and associated ethical considerations; and 3) an introductory framework incorporating best practices in requests for LVAD deactivation (specifically in controversial situations without obvious medical or device-related complications). In such decisions, heart failure teams can safeguard patient preferences without compromising ethical practice through more explicit advance care planning before LVAD implantation, early integration of hospice and palliative medicine specialists (maintained throughout the disease process), and further research interrogating behaviors and attitudes related to LVAD deactivation.",2023,Nov,JACC Heart Fail,11,11,1481-1490,,10.1016/j.jchf.2023.08.004,37768252,#716,Zaidi 2023,,,0
Prospective Patient Preferences for Humor in Urologists Treating Erectile Dysfunction: A Survey Study.,Sandler MD; Egemba C; Dubin JM; Saltzman RG; Pearlman A; Golan R; Ramasamy R,"INTRODUCTION: Men seeking treatment for sexual dysfunction can experience embarrassment as a result of stigma. This research manuscript presents the findings of a survey conducted to investigate the influence of humor on prospective patients' preferences when selecting a specialist to address erectile dysfunction (ED). METHODS: The respondents were presented with five pairs of mock urology business cards: one professional and one humorous. A questionnaire was designed and distributed via an online survey platform. Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 29 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY) to evaluate age and race associations with card preference. RESULTS: Among the 997 participants, an average of 66.1% (a median of 71.2%) preferred professional cards. Humorous card selection rates ranged from 5.2% to 38.4% compared to 54.0% to 78.1% for professional cards. A statistically significant relationship between age and professional card choice existed in all except the fifth set of cards (p = 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, and 0.054). The relationship between race or ethnicity and business card preference was not reported due to an imbalance in demographics, with most participants identifying as Caucasian. DISCUSSION: A humor-centric approach may not resonate with all individuals seeking treatment for sensitive conditions such as ED. Limitations include the subjectivity of humor, the use of an online survey platform, and the hypothetical nature of this study. Real patients experiencing ED may face stigma and respond to humor differently. CONCLUSION: This study provides insights into patient preference for professionalism over humor from their urologist but leaves room for the exploration of humor in medical contexts. Future studies could examine the impacts of humor on patient choices in real-world healthcare settings.",2024,Mar,Cureus,16,3,e55637,,10.7759/cureus.55637,38586671,#255,Sandler 2024,,,0
"Patient experience in community health services and first choice for medical attention: A cross-sectional study in Wuhan, China.",Tang C; Fang P; Bai X; Min R; Liu C,"OBJECTIVES: In China, it is up to the patients to choose between hospitals and primary care facilities to initiate their medical care. This study aimed to determine the association between patient experience with community health centres (CHCs, a predominant provider of community-based primary care) and patient preference of taking community-based primary care facilities as a first choice for medical attention. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted on 1919 patients who sought medical care in 55 CHCs in Wuhan, China. Respondents were asked to identify their preferred first choice for medical attention and rate their satisfaction with eight aspects of CHCs (basic facility, medical equipment, medical services, nursing services, treatment process, courtesy and responsiveness, time spent with medical doctor, pharmacy services). Multivariate logistic regression models were established to determine the association between the CHC experience and the first choice of providers after adjustment for variations in sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Over 90% of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with the eight aspects of CHCs; but only 75% preferred to take community-based primary care facilities as their first choice for medical attention. Those who were older and had a lower income were more likely to choose community-based primary care facilities. Geographic proximity and higher levels of satisfaction with the basic facility, courtesy and responsiveness, and pharmacy services in the CHCs were associated with a higher likelihood of taking community-based primary care facilities as a first choice for medical attention. CONCLUSION: The consumers of CHCs are generally satisfied with the services they received. However, one quarter of the CHC patients are yet to be convinced to accept community-based primary care facilities as a preferred first provider for medical care. Geographic proximity and patient experience with CHCs are associated with the patient choice.",2023,,PLoS One,18,7,e0288164,,10.1371/journal.pone.0288164,37490476,#1045,Tang 2023,,,0
Clinical Investigation of Large Volume Subcutaneous Delivery up to 25 mL for Lean and Non-Lean Subjects.,Dang X; Shih H; Sharma R; Angwin-Kaerner DT; Lin K; Kapur S; Thyagarajapuram NR; Shi GH; Collins DS,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical feasibility and tolerability of large volume subcutaneous delivery at different injection depths for lean and non-lean subjects. METHODS: A single-center, randomized, subject-blinded, crossover study in 62 healthy subjects was conducted to evaluate delivery of a 10-cP solution containing hyaluronic acid. Subjects were separated into lean and non-lean cohort by SC thickness. A syringe pump was used to study the effect of different volumes (5, 12, 25 mL) of a viscous placebo solution and needle lengths (6, 9 and 12 mm) delivered at 0.5 mL/min. RESULTS: Across all treatments, injection sites were observed to have negligible leakage, ~34 kPa of back pressure, and VAS of mild pain with higher pain from needle insertion than during injection. While mild to moderate erythema was the most frequently reported ISR and edema was most prominent for 25 mL injections, all ISRs were resolved within 4 hours post injection. Subjects were unbothered by ISRs across all treatments and rated them as low distress scores (average 1.0-1.5 out of 6). CONCLUSION: SC injection of 25 mL is feasible and tolerable using a low-pain formulation for abdomen injection irrespective of subcutaneous thickness and injection depths at a delivery rate of 0.5 mL/min.",2024,Mar,Pharm Res,,,,,10.1007/s11095-024-03683-5,38443633,#259,Dang 2024,,,0
In the eyes of the beholders: Subjective experiences of positive symptoms among patients with symptoms of psychosis seeking psychotherapy.,Schneider BC; Rahmede M; Pillny M; Karow A; Moritz S; Veckenstedt R,"BACKGROUND: Reduction of positive symptoms is often the focus of psychiatric treatment for patients with psychosis; however, it is becoming increasingly clear that some patients experience ambivalence towards positive symptoms or may even experience them as pleasant. The present study extends upon work from online studies of patients without verified diagnoses. The first aim was to examine the frequency with which patients report negative, neutral or even positive appraisals of positive symptoms. A second aim was to identify whether these appraisals were associated with medication adherence. METHODS: One-hundred twelve treatment-seeking patients with current symptoms of psychosis completed the Subjective Perception of Positive Symptoms-Revised (SUPPOSY-R), a scale assessing appraisals of positive symptoms (e.g., gain from illness, impact on daily life), as well as questions regarding medication adherence. RESULTS: Although most patients reported experiencing positive symptoms as predominantly unpleasant, appraisals differed between symptom clusters and up to 54.4 % reported that they would miss at least some aspects of positive symptoms should they disappear. Patients particularly welcomed the disappearance of auditory hallucinations (71.2 %). Symptom appraisal was not significantly associated with medication compliance (p > .17); however, more patients with low medication adherence reported they would feel at least some regret if their symptoms were to completely disappear (48.9 %, n = 23) versus patients with high adherence (41.7 %, n = 20). DISCUSSION: Ambivalent or positive appraisals of positive symptoms are lower among treatment-seeking patients compared to patients recruited for online studies, who may not be actively seeking treatment. Auditory hallucinations may cause most distress among treatment-seeking patients. A collaborative approach including assessment of possible positive appraisals of symptoms is important when identifying treatment goals.",2023,Apr,Schizophr Res,254,,14-21,,10.1016/j.schres.2022.12.025,36758324,#1361,Schneider 2023,,,0
Influence of Self-Reported Health Impairments on German EQ-5D-5L Values.,Elkenkamp S; Ludwig K; Greiner W,"OBJECTIVES: The German EQ-5D-5L value set is based on the average preferences of the general population. Nevertheless, in Germany, there is an ongoing debate about the appropriateness of using general population preferences and whether patient preferences should be used instead. Thus, this research aimed to determine the robustness of the German EQ-5D-5L valuation data for the general population compared with those with health impairments. METHODS: Subgroups were built on the self-reported quality of life, measured with the EQ-5D-5L. To identify which groups significantly influenced the value set, different regression models, including dummy variables for the subgroups, were tested while controlling for preference heterogeneity. Backward selection based on the Akaike information criterion led to significant subgroup dummies, which were analyzed in more detail. For each significant subgroup, the value set model was estimated separately. The models were then compared. Sociodemographics of the subgroups were considered. RESULTS: Three significant dummies were identified: state 11111, severity levels 5 to 7, and self-reported problems with pain/discomfort. The value sets for the 6 subgroups were compared with the national German value set, showing only marginal deviations. The mean absolute deviation ranged from 0.004 to 0.013. No different densities were identified for the decrements of the different value sets. CONCLUSIONS: People with self-reported health impairments do not have different EQ-5D-5L health state preferences compared with the German general population. Further research is needed to determine whether the presence of a chronic health condition has a larger influence on health state valuation than the general population.",2023,Nov,Value Health,26,11,1636-1644,,10.1016/j.jval.2023.08.006,37722592,#721,Elkenkamp 2023,,,0
Factors Associated With Mode of Separation for People With Palliative Diagnoses With Preference for Home Death Receiving Care From a Nurse-Led End of Life (Palliative Extended and Care at Home) Program.,Agar MR; Xuan W; Lee J; Barclay G; Oloffs A; Jobburn K; Harlum J; Maurya N; Chow JSF,"Palliative Extended and Care at Home (PEACH) is a rapid response nurse-led package of care mobilized for palliative care patients who have an expressed preference to die at home. This study aimed to identify the demographic and clinical predictors of home death for patients receiving the package. Deidentified data were used from administrative and clinical information systems. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess association of sociodemographic factors with mode of separation. Furthermore, 1754 clients received the PEACH package during the study period. Mode of separation was home death (75.7%), hospital/palliative care unit admission (13.5%), and alive/discharged from the PEACH Program (10.8%). Of participants with clear preference to die at home, 79% met their wish. Multivariate analysis demonstrated cancer diagnosis, patients who wished to be admitted when death was imminent, and patients with undecided preference for location of death were associated with an increased likelihood of being admitted to the hospital. Compared with those with spousal caregivers, those cared for by their child/grandchild and other nonspouse caregivers were significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of being admitted to the hospital/palliative care unit.

Patient Preference Trade-offs for Next-Generation Kidney Replacement Therapies.,Wilson L; Gress AF; Frassetto L; Sarathy H; Gress EA; Fissell WH; Roy S,"BACKGROUND: Next-generation implantable and wearable KRTs may revolutionize the lives of patients undergoing dialysis by providing more frequent and/or prolonged therapy along with greater mobility compared with in-center hemodialysis. Medical device innovators would benefit from patient input to inform product design and development. Our objective was to determine key risk/benefit considerations for patients with kidney failure and test how these trade-offs could drive patient treatment choices. METHODS: We developed a choice-based conjoint discrete choice instrument and surveyed 498 patients with kidney failure. The choice-based conjoint instrument consisted of nine attributes of risk and benefit pertinent across KRT modalities. Attributes were derived from literature reviews, patient/clinician interviews, and pilot testing. The risk attributes were serious infection, death within 5 years, permanent device failure, surgical requirements, and follow-up requirements. The benefit attributes were fewer diet restrictions, improved mobility, pill burden, and fatigue. We created a random, full-profile, balanced overlap design with 14 choice pairs plus five fixed tasks to test validity. We used a mixed-effects regression model with attribute levels as independent predictor variables and choice decisions as dependent variables. RESULTS: All variables were significantly important to patient choice preferences, except follow-up requirements. For each 1% higher risk of death within 5 years, preference utility was lower by 2.22 ( β =-2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.52 to -1.91), while for each 1% higher risk of serious infection, utility was lower by 1.38 ( β =-1.46; 95% CI, -1.77 to -1.00) according to comparisons of the β coefficients. Patients were willing to trade a 1% infection risk and 0.5% risk of death to gain complete mobility and freedom from in-center hemodialysis ( β =1.46; 95% CI, 1.27 to 1.64). CONCLUSIONS: Despite an aversion to even a 1% higher risk of death within 5 years, serious infection, and permanent device rejection, patients with kidney failure suggested that they would trade these risks for the benefit of complete mobility.",2023,Oct,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,19,1,76-84,,10.2215/CJN.0000000000000313,37874941,#787,Wilson 2023,,,1
How does patient-centered communication influence patient trust?: The roles of patient participation and patient preference.,Jiang S; Wu Z; Zhang X; Ji Y; Xu J; Liu P; Liu Y; Zheng J; Zhao L; Chen J,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of patient-centered communication, patient participation, and patient preference on patient trust in the context of China. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted involving 217 cancer patients in China. Mediation and moderation analyses were performed to examine the relationships among the study variables. RESULTS: First, patient-centered communication increased patient participation in decision-making, which, in turn, enhanced patient trust. Second, patient-centered communication did not have a direct effect on patient trust. Third, patient preference for a passive role in decision-making weakened the relationship between patient participation and patient trust. CONCLUSION: The results underscore the significant effect of facilitating patient participation in linking patient-centered communication to patient trust. However, medical communication should also respond to patients' preferred roles in the decision-making process.

In addition, they should evaluate patients' preferred degree of involvement before inviting them to contribute so as to respect their preferences and values.",2024,May,Patient Educ Couns,122,,108161,,10.1016/j.pec.2024.108161,38308973,#167,Jiang 2024,,,0
Coping with COVID: Performance of China's hierarchical medical system during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Yang Y; Huang L; Yan H; Nicholas S; Maitland E; Bai Q; Shi X,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the health system worldwide. This study aimed to assess how China's hierarchical medical system (HMS) coped with COVID-19 in the short-and medium-term. We mainly measured the number and distribution of hospital visits and healthcare expenditure between primary and high-level hospitals during Beijing's 2020-2021 pandemic relative to the 2017-2019 pre-COVID-19 benchmark period. METHODS: Hospital operational data were extracted from Municipal Health Statistics Information Platform. The COVID-19 period in Beijing was divided into five phases, corresponding to different characteristics, from January 2020 to October 2021. The main outcome measures in this study include the percentage change in inpatient and outpatient emergency visits, and surgeries, and changing distribution of patients between different hospital levels across Beijing's HMS. In addition, the corresponding health expenditure in each of the 5 phases of COVID-19 was also included. RESULTS: In the outbreak phase of the pandemic, the total visits of Beijing hospitals declined dramatically, where outpatient visits fell 44.6%, inpatients visits fell 47.9%; emergency visits fell 35.6%, and surgery inpatients fell 44.5%. Correspondingly, health expenditures declined 30.5% for outpatients and 43.0% for inpatients. The primary hospitals absorbed a 9.51% higher proportion of outpatients than the pre-COVID-19 level in phase 1. In phase 4, the number of patients, including non-local outpatients reached pre-pandemic 2017-2019 benchmark levels. The proportion of outpatients in primary hospitals was only 1.74% above pre-COVID-19 levels in phases 4 and 5. Health expenditure for both outpatients and inpatients reached the baseline level in phase 3 and increased nearly 10% above pre-COVID-19 levels in phases 4 and 5. CONCLUSION: The HMS in Beijing coped with the COVID-19 pandemic in a relatively short time, the early stage of the pandemic reflected an enhanced role for primary hospitals in the HMS, but did not permanently change patient preferences for high-level hospitals. Relative to the pre-COVID-19 benchmark, the elevated hospital expenditure in phase 4 and phase 5 pointed to hospital over-treatment or patient excess treatment demand. We suggest improving the service capacity of primary hospitals and changing the preferences of patients through health education in the post-COVID-19 world.",2023,,Front Public Health,11,,1148847,,10.3389/fpubh.2023.1148847,37181683,#1310,Yang 2023,,,0
Prospective Six-Month Analysis of Multiarea Burst Spinal Cord Stimulation: Correlating Intraoperative Neuromonitoring With Postoperative Programming and Clinical Outcomes.,Falowski SM; Nanivadekar AC,"INTRODUCTION: DeRidder burst spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has shown superior relief from overall pain to traditional tonic neurostimulation therapies and a reduction in back and leg pain. However, nearly 80% of patients have two or more noncontiguous pain areas. This affects the ability to effectively program stimulation and deliver long-term efficacy of the therapy. Multiple DeRidder burst region programming is an option to treat multisite pain by interleaving stimulation at multiple areas along the spinal cord. Previous intraoperative neuromonitoring studies have shown that DeRidder burst stimulation provides broader myotomal coverage at a lower recruitment threshold. The goal of this study is to correlate intraoperative electromyogram (EMG) threshold and postsynaptic excitability with postoperative paresthesia thresholds and optimal burst stimulation programming. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Neuromonitoring was performed during permanent implant of SCS leads in ten patients diagnosed with chronic intractable back and/or leg pain. Each patient underwent the surgical placement of a Penta Paddle electrode through laminectomy at the T8-T11 spinal levels. Subdermal electrode needles were placed into lower extremity muscle groups, in addition to the rectus abdominis muscles, for EMG recording. Evoked responses were compared across multiple trials of burst stimulation in which the number of independent burst areas was varied. After intraoperative data collection, all patients were programmed with single- and multiarea DeRidder burst. Intermittent dosing was delivered at 30:90, 120:360, 120:720, and 120:1440 (seconds ON/OFF) intervals. Numerical rating scale (NRS) and Patient Global Impression of Change scores were evaluated at one, two, three, four, and six months after permanent implant. RESULTS: The thresholds for EMG recruitment after DeRidder burst differed across all patients owing to anatomical and physiological variations. After a 30-second dose of stimulation, the average decrease in thresholds was 1.25 mA for two-area and 0.9 mA for four-area DeRidder burst. Furthermore, a 30-second dose of multisite DeRidder burst produced a 0.25 mA reduction in the postoperative paresthesia thresholds. Across all patients, the baseline NRS score was 6.5 ± 0.5, and the NRS score after single or multiarea DeRidder burst therapy was 2.87 ± 1.50. Eight of ten patients reported a ≥50% decrease in their pain scores through the six-month follow-up visit. Pain outcomes using intermittent multiarea stimulation with longer OFF times (120:360, 120:720, 120:1440) were comparable to those using single-area DeRidder burst at 30:90 up to six months after implant with patient preference being two-area DeRidder burst. CONCLUSIONS: This study aims to evaluate the use of intraoperative neuromonitoring to optimize stimulation programming for multisite pain and correlate it with postoperative programming and efficacy. These results suggest that multisite programming can be used to further customize DeRidder burst stimulation to each individual patient and improve outcomes and quality of life for patients receiving SCS therapy for multisite pain.",2024,Mar,Neuromodulation,,,,,10.1016/j.neurom.2024.02.003,38520459,#214,Falowski 2024,,,0
Prosthesis preferences for those with upper limb loss: Discrete choice study of PULLTY® for use in regulatory decisions.,Wilson L; Dohan D; Garibaldi M; Szeto D; Timmerman M; Matheny J,"INTRODUCTION: The patient's voice in shared decision-making has progressed from physician's office to regulatory decision-making for medical devices with FDA's Patient Preference Initiative. A discrete-choice preference measure for upper limb prosthetic devices was developed to investigate patient's risk/benefit preference choices for regulatory decision making. METHODS: Rapid ethnographic procedures were used to design a discrete-choice measure describing risk and benefits of osseointegration with myoelectric control and test in a pilot preference study in adults with upper limb loss. Primary outcome is utility of each choice based conjoint (CBC) attribute using mixed-effects regression. Utilities with and without video, and between genders were compared. RESULTS: Strongest negative preference was for avoiding infection risk (B = -1.77, p < 0.001) and chance of daily pain (B = -1.22, p, 0.001). Strongest positive preference was for attaining complete independence when cooking dinner (B = 1.62, p < 0.001) and smooth grip patterns at all levels (B = 1.62, B = 1.28, B = 1.26, p < 0.001). Trade-offs showed a 1% increase in risk of serious/treatable infection resulted in a 1.77 decrease in relative preference. There were gender differences, and where video was used, preferences were stronger. CONCLUSIONS: Strongest preferences were for attributes of functionality and independence versus connectedness and sensation but showed willingness to make risk-benefit trade-offs.

A cross-sectional study evaluating patients' preferences for Salter innominate osteotomy.,Segawa Y; Jinno T; Matsubara M; Matsuyama Y; Fujiwara T; Okawa A,"BACKGROUND: Residual acetabular dysplasia in children after reduction of hip dislocation is often treated using Salter innominate osteotomy to prevent future osteoarthritis. Preventive surgery for asymptomatic patients, which could result in overtreatment, should be carefully applied with consideration of patients' opinions. In this study, we aimed to describe opinions on Salter innominate osteotomy as preventive surgery for children among adult patients who had undergone periacetabular osteotomy for hip pain due to hip dysplasia. METHODS: A mail-in questionnaire survey was conducted with 77 patients who underwent periacetabular osteotomy. Participants responded whether they would recommend Salter innominate osteotomy as preventive surgery for children and the reason for their opinion. We also performed a patient-based evaluation using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association Hip-Disease Evaluation Questionnaire and assessed clinical outcome measures with the Japanese Orthopedic Association score. Their recommendations and reasons were evaluated, and associations between their opinions and demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-three patients (56%) responded to the questionnaire. Of these, 10 (23%) patients recommended undergoing Salter innominate osteotomy, 28 (65%) patients did not, and 5 (12%) patients responded they were undecided. No significant association was observed between their opinions and demographic/clinical characteristics evaluated in the survey. The most frequent reason for why they do not recommend Salter innominate osteotomy was related to uncertainty about future hip pain. CONCLUSIONS: In total, 65% of the study participants did not recommend Salter innominate osteotomy for children with risk of dysplasia in the future. Participants' preferences regarding preventive surgery were not influenced by demographic and clinical characteristics.",2023,Nov,J Orthop Sci,28,6,1298-1302,,10.1016/j.jos.2022.09.007,36272927,#751,Segawa 2023,,,0
Telemedicine for Neurosurgery Consultations at a Pituitary Center of Excellence: Patient Preference and Willingness to Proceed with Surgery.,Greven ACM; Douglas JM; Couceyro J; Nakirikanti A; Dawoud R; Revuelta-Barbero M; Ward E; Giraldi EA; Ioachimescu A; Hoang KB; Bray DP; Oyesiku NM,"Objective  The purpose of this study was to evaluate pituitary tumor patient satisfaction with telemedicine, patient preference for telemedicine, potential socioeconomic benefit of telemedicine, and patients' willingness to proceed with surgery based on a telemedicine visit alone. Method  In total, 134 patients who had pituitary surgery and a telemedicine visit during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (April 23, 2020-March 4, 2021) were called to participate in a 13-part questionnaire. Chi-square, ANOVA, and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were used to determine significance. Result  Of 134 patients contacted, 90 responded (67%). Ninety-five percent were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with their telemedicine visit, with 62% stating their visit was ""the same"" or ""better"" than previous in-person appointments. Eighty-two percent of the patients rated their telemedicine visit as ""easy"" or ""very easy."" On average, patients saved 150 minutes by using telemedicine compared with patient reported in-person visit times. Seventy-seven percent of patients reported the need to take off from work for in-person visits, compared with just 12% when using telemedicine. Forty-nine percent of patients preferred in-person visits, 34% preferred telemedicine, and 17% had no preference. Fifty percent of patients said they would feel comfortable proceeding with surgery based on a telemedicine visit alone. Patients with both initial evaluation and follow-up conducted via telemedicine were more likely to feel comfortable proceeding with surgery based on a telemedicine visit alone compared with patients who had only follow-up telemedicine visits ( p  = 0.051). Conclusion  Many patients are satisfied with telemedicine visits and feel comfortable proceeding with surgery based on a telemedicine visit alone.

Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options for pain relief during labor: an expert review.,Zuarez-Easton S; Erez O; Zafran N; Carmeli J; Garmi G; Salim R,"Labor pain is among the most severe types of physical pain that women may experience during their lifetime. Thus, pain relief is an essential part of medical care during childbirth. Epidural analgesia is considered to be the most efficient method of pain relief during labor. Nevertheless, patient preferences, contraindications, limited availability, and technical failure may require the use of alternative pain reliving methods during labor including systemic pharmacologic agents, and nonpharmacologic methods. Nonpharmacologic methods for pain alleviation during vaginal birth have become popular over the years, either as a complement to pharmacologic agents or at times as the principal therapy. Methods such as relaxation techniques (ie, yoga, hypnosis, and music), manual techniques (ie, massage, reflexology, and shiatsu), acupuncture, birthing ball, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation are considered safe, although the evidence supporting their effectiveness for pain relief is not as robust as it is for pharmacologic agents. Systemic pharmacologic agents are mostly administered by inhalation (nitrous oxide) or through the parenteral route. These agents include opioids such as meperidine, nalbuphine, tramadol, butorphanol, morphine, and remifentanil, and non-opioid agents such as parenteral acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Systemic pharmacologic agents suggest a diverse armamentarium of medication for pain management during labor. Their efficacy in treating pain associated with labor varies, and some continue to be used even though they have not been proven effective for pain relief. In addition, the maternal and perinatal side effects differ markedly among these agents. There is a relative abundance of data regarding the effectiveness of analgesic drugs compared with epidural, but the data regarding comparisons among the different types of alternative analgesic agents are scarce, and there is no consistency regarding the drug of choice for women who do not receive epidural pain management. This review aims to present the available data regarding the effectiveness of the different methods of relieving pain during labor other than epidural. The data presented are mainly based on recent level I evidence regarding pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods for pain relief during labor.",2023,May,Am J Obstet Gynecol,228,5S,S1246-S1259,,10.1016/j.ajog.2023.03.003,37005099,#1274,Zuarez-Easton 2023,,,0
A meta-analysis on the role older adults with cancer favour in treatment decision making.,van der Waal MS; Seghers N; Welsing PMJ; van Huis LH; Emmelot-Vonk MH; Hamaker ME,"INTRODUCTION: In the complex setting of oncological treatment decision making, balancing professional guidance while respecting patient involvement can be a challenge. We set out to assess the role adults with cancer favour in treatment decision making (TDM), including differences across age groups and change over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE and Embase, for studies on role preference of (older) adults with cancer in oncological treatment decision making. A meta-analysis was conducted based on Control Preference Scale (CPS) data, a questionnaire on patient role preference in TDM. RESULTS: This meta-analysis includes 33 studies reporting CPS data comprising 17,197 adults with cancer. Mean age was 60.6 years old for studies that specified age (24 studies, 6155 patients). During the last decade, patients' role preference shifted towards significantly more active involvement in TDM (p = 0.006). No age-dependent subgroup differences have been identified; both younger and older adults, defined as, respectively, below and above 65 years old, favour active involvement in treatment decision making. DISCUSSION: Over time, adults with cancer have shifted towards more active role preference in treatment decision making. In current cancer care, a large majority prefers taking an active role, irrespective of age.",2023,Jan,J Geriatr Oncol,14,1,101383,,10.1016/j.jgo.2022.09.012,36243627,#1650,vanderWaal 2023,,,0
Effect of protocol-based family visitation on physiological indicators in ICU patients: a randomized controlled trial.,Nazari-Ostad Z; Namazinia M; Hajiabadi F; Aghebati N; Esmaily H; Peivandi Yazdi A,"BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) patients often experience significant physiological stress. This study evaluated the effect of a defined family visitation protocol on physiological responses in the ICU. METHODS: A randomized, block-randomized clinical trial was conducted on 78 ICU patients at Imam Reza Hospital between February 8, 2017, and August 8, 2017. The intervention group received protocol-based visits, and the control group continued with standard visitation. Block randomization was utilized for group assignments. The primary outcome was the measurement of physiological signs using designated monitoring devices. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22, employing independent t-tests, Mann-Whitney U test, repeated measures analysis, and Friedman's test. RESULTS: The results showed no significant differences in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, and arterial blood oxygen levels between the two groups. However, heart rate in the intervention group was significantly lower in three stages before, during, and after the meaningful visiting (P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Protocol-based scheduled family visits in the ICU may reduce physiological stress, as evidenced by a decrease in patients' heart rate. Implementing tailored visitation protocols sensitive to patient preferences and clinical contexts is advisable, suggesting the integration of family visits into standard care practices for enhanced patient outcomes.

Physical therapist clinical reasoning in home care for walking assistive device prescription: A description of practice.,O'Brien SR; Barry M; Davidson E; Porzi L; Spink M; Weatherbee D,"BACKGROUND: Home care in the United States (US) provides rehabilitative care to people who are homebound after acute hospitalization. Patients with stroke and brain injury (BI) are commonly seen by physical therapists (PTs/PTAs), who often address the loss of walking independence. Clinical reasoning (CR) is required for walking assistive device (WAD) prescription within the home. There has never been a description of the home care PT CR process, which could inform entry-level training and health policy. PURPOSE: To describe the homecare CR process by identifying factors used for prescription of WADs in patients with stroke and BI. Secondly, to describe any practice issues associated with WADs. METHODS: Directors of 7 agencies affiliated with Nazareth College DPT program were recruited to identify PTs/PTAs to complete an online survey between March - July 2017. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected, and analyzed for frequencies or for common themes. RESULTS: A total of 334 PTs/PTAs were enrolled from all agencies and 72 responses were analyzed. The CR process did not differ between stroke and BI. Safety was the primary factor, which was assessed by patient query, observation skills, and objective measures. PTs/PTAs also measured balance, strength, function, cognition, and patient preferences within the context of the home. WADs obtained prior to initiation of home care often weren't used. CONCLUSION: A complex CR process has been described for WAD prescription in home care for patients with stroke and BI.

"""I want to stay here"": Patient and staff perspectives on transitioning from a low-threshold buprenorphine program to clinic-based care.",Martinez NG; Truong AQ; Nordeck CD; Agus D; Genberg BL; Buresh ME,"BACKGROUND: The Project Connections At Re-Entry (PCARE) Van is a low-threshold buprenorphine program operating outside the Baltimore City Detention Center. Like other low-threshold programs, PCARE seeks to engage a vulnerable population in care, stabilize patients, then transition patients to longer-term care; however, <10% of patients transition to clinic-based buprenorphine treatment. Our goal was to better understand these low transition rates and center patient perspectives in discussion of broader low-threshold program design. METHODS: From December 2022 to June 2023, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 former and current PCARE patients and 6 staff members. We used deductive and inductive coding followed by thematic content analysis to identify themes around treatment experiences and care preferences. RESULTS: There were strong preferences among current and former patients for continuing buprenorphine treatment at the PCARE Van. Several themes emerged from the data that explained patient preferences, including both advantages to continuing care at the van (preference for continuity, feeling respected by the program's structure and philosophy) and disadvantages to transitioning to a clinic (perceived harms associated with rigid or punitive care models). Staff noted limited program capacity, and patients expressed that if needed, they would transition to a clinic for altruistic reasons. Staff expressed varied perspectives on low-threshold care, emphasizing both larger systems factors, as well as beliefs about individual patient responsibility. CONCLUSIONS: While many low-threshold care settings are designed as transitional bridge models, this research highlights patient preference for long-term care at low-threshold programs and supports efforts to adapt low-threshold models to be sustainable as longitudinal care.",2024,Feb,Drug Alcohol Depend,257,,111130,,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2024.111130,38452408,#342,Martinez 2024,,,0
A discrete choice experiment to quantify the influence of trial features on the decision to participate in cystic fibrosis trials.,Dobra R; Davies J; Elborn S; Kee F; Madge S; Boeri M,"BACKGROUND: Patient-centred trial design optimises recruitment and retention, reduces trial failure rates and increases the diversity of trial cohorts. This allows safe and effective treatments to reach clinic more quickly. To achieve this, patients' views must be incorporated into trial design. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was used to quantify preferences of pwCF for trials features; medicine type, trial location, stipend, washout, drug access on trial completion and trial design. Respondents were presented pairs of hypothetical trial scenarios with different level combinations assigned through experimental design. Respondents were asked to pick their preferred option or decline both. The cross-sectional data were explored using a Random Parameters Logit model. RESULTS: We received 207 eligible responses between Oct2020-Jan2021. The strongest influence on the decision to participate was trial location; pwCF favour participation at their usual clinical centre. Greater travel distances made respondents less willing to participate. Post-trial drug access ranked second. pwCF would rather participate in modulator trials than trials of other drugs. In general, pwCF did not favour a washout period, but were more prepared to washout non-modulators than modulators. Stipend provision was not ranked highly, but higher stipends increased intention to participate. Trial design (placebo vs open-label) had minimal influence on the decision to participate. There are complex interactions between placebos and washouts. CONCLUSIONS: We used quantitative methods to systematically elicit preferences of pwCF for clinical trials' features. We explore the relevance of our findings to trial design and delivery in the current CF trials landscape.",2024,Jan,J Cyst Fibros,23,1,73-79,,10.1016/j.jcf.2023.04.024,38042750,#515,Dobra 2024,,,1
Physiotherapists should apply health coaching techniques and incorporate accountability to foster adherence to a walking program for low back pain: a qualitative study.,Pocovi NC; Ayre J; French SD; Lin CC; Tiedemann A; Maher CG; Merom D; McCaffrey K; Hancock MJ,"QUESTIONS: What motivates individuals to start a walking program for the prevention of low back pain? What strategies optimise short-term and long-term adherence to a walking program? What strategies can physiotherapists incorporate into clinical practice to facilitate commencement of and adherence to a walking program? DESIGN: Qualitative study. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two adults recently recovered from an episode of non-specific low back pain who participated in a 6-month, progressive and individualised walking program that was prescribed by a physiotherapist trained in health coaching. METHODS: Semi-structured focus groups conducted online following completion of the walking program. Interview questions explored: primary motivations for starting a walking program, identification of which elements were useful in optimising adherence to the program, and identification of the barriers to and facilitators of engagement with the program. Audio recordings were transcribed and thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified. Theme one identified that strong motivators to start a walking program were anticipated improvements in low back pain management and the added general health benefits of a more active lifestyle. Theme two identified that fear of high-impact exercises led to avoidance; however, walking was considered a safe exercise option. Theme three identified accountability, enjoyment of exercise and health benefits were critical to adherence. CONCLUSION: Participants recently recovered from low back pain reflected positively on a physiotherapist-prescribed walking program. Participants described what elements of the program were crucial to starting exercise and optimising adherence.

Similar Midterm Outcomes of Total Knee Arthroplasties with Anterior and Posterior Tibial Slopes Performed on Paired Knees at a Minimum Follow-up of 5 Years.,Song SJ; Bae DK; Hwang SH; Park HS; Park CH,"A small posterior tibial slope (PTS) is generally recommended in posterior stabilized (PS) total knee arthroplasty (TKA). An unwanted anterior tibial slope (ATS), which can affect postoperative results, may be created in PS TKA because of the inaccuracy of surgical instruments and techniques, as well as high interpatient variability. We compared midterm clinical and radiographic results of PS TKAs with ATS and PTS performed on paired knees using the same prosthesis. One-hundred-twenty-four patients who underwent TKAs with ATS and PTS on paired knees using ATTUNE posterior-stabilized prostheses were retrospectively reviewed after a minimum follow-up period of 5 years. The mean follow-up period was 5.4 years. The Knee Society Knee and Function scores, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Feller and Kujalar scores, and range of motion (ROM) were evaluated. The preferred TKA out of ATS and PTS was also investigated. The hip-knee-ankle angle, component positions, tibial slope, posterior femoral offset, Insall-Salvati ratio, and knee sagittal angle were measured by radiography. There were no significant differences in the clinical results, including ROM, between TKAs with ATS and PTS preoperatively and at the last follow-up. Regarding patient preference, 58 patients (46.8%) were satisfied with bilateral knees, 30 (24.2%) preferred knees with ATS, and 36 (29%) preferred knees with PTS. There was no significant difference in the rate of preference between TKAs with ATS and PTS (p = 0.539). Except for the postoperative tibial slope (-1.8 vs. 2.5 degrees, p < 0.001), there were also no significant differences in the radiographic results, including the knee sagittal angle, preoperatively and at the last follow-up. The midterm outcomes were similar between PS TKAs with ATS and PTS performed on paired knees at a minimum of 5 years of follow-up. Nonsevere ATS did not affect midterm outcomes in PS TKA with proper soft tissue balancing and the current prosthesis of improved design. However, a long-term follow-up study is required to confirm the safety of nonsevere ATS in PS TKA.

An Actionable Expert-System Algorithm to Support Nurse-Led Cancer Survivorship Care: Algorithm Development Study.,Pfisterer KJ; Lohani R; Janes E; Ng D; Wang D; Bryant-Lukosius D; Rendon R; Berlin A; Bender J; Brown I; Feifer A; Gotto G; Saha S; Cafazzo JA; Pham Q,"BACKGROUND: Comprehensive models of survivorship care are necessary to improve access to and coordination of care. New models of care provide the opportunity to address the complexity of physical and psychosocial problems and long-term health needs experienced by patients following cancer treatment. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents our expert-informed, rules-based survivorship algorithm to build a nurse-led model of survivorship care to support men living with prostate cancer (PCa). The algorithm is called No Evidence of Disease (Ned) and supports timelier decision-making, enhanced safety, and continuity of care. METHODS: An initial rule set was developed and refined through working groups with clinical experts across Canada (eg, nurse experts, physician experts, and scientists; n=20), and patient partners (n=3). Algorithm priorities were defined through a multidisciplinary consensus meeting with clinical nurse specialists, nurse scientists, nurse practitioners, urologic oncologists, urologists, and radiation oncologists (n=17). The system was refined and validated using the nominal group technique. RESULTS: Four levels of alert classification were established, initiated by responses on the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice survey, and mediated by changes in minimal clinically important different alert thresholds, alert history, and clinical urgency with patient autonomy influencing clinical acuity. Patient autonomy was supported through tailored education as a first line of response, and alert escalation depending on a patient-initiated request for a nurse consultation. CONCLUSIONS: The Ned algorithm is positioned to facilitate PCa nurse-led care models with a high nurse-to-patient ratio. This novel expert-informed PCa survivorship care algorithm contains a defined escalation pathway for clinically urgent symptoms while honoring patient preference. Though further validation is required through a pragmatic trial, we anticipate the Ned algorithm will support timelier decision-making and enhance continuity of care through the automation of more frequent automated checkpoints, while empowering patients to self-manage their symptoms more effectively than standard care.

Women's needs for lifestyle risk reduction engagement during the interconception period: a scoping review.,James S; Moulton JE; Assifi A; Botfield J; Black K; Hanson M; Mazza D,"BACKGROUND: Unhealthy lifestyle is responsible for many chronic conditions, and antenatal engagement with women about lifestyle behaviours can be too late to prevent some adverse pregnancy outcomes and subsequent childhood risks. To reduce the risk of future adverse outcomes, the interconception period is an opportunity to implement positive health changes. The aim of this scoping review was to explore women's needs for lifestyle risk reduction engagement during the interconception period. METHODS: The JBI methodology guided our scoping review. Six databases were searched for peer-reviewed, English-language research papers published between 2010 and 2021 on topics including perceptions, attitudes, lifestyle, postpartum, preconception and interconception. Title-abstract and full text screening was independently undertaken by two authors. Included papers' reference lists were searched to find additional papers. The main concepts were then identified using a descriptive and tabular approach. RESULTS: A total of 1734 papers were screened and 33 met our inclusion criteria. Most included papers (82%, n=27) reported on nutrition and/or physical activity. Papers identified interconception through postpartum and/or preconception. Women's self-management needs for lifestyle risk reduction engagement during interconception included: informational needs, managing competing priorities, physical and mental health, self-perception and motivation, access to services and professional support, and family and peer networks. CONCLUSIONS: There is a range of challenges for women to engage in lifestyle risk reduction during interconception. To enable women's preferences for how lifestyle risk reduction activities can be enacted, issues including childcare, ongoing and tailored health professional support, domestic support, cost and health literacy need to be addressed.",2023,Oct,BMJ Sex Reprod Health,49,4,274-281,,10.1136/bmjsrh-2022-201699,36849222,#845,James 2023,,,0
Treatment preferences in relation to fatigue of patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis: A discrete choice experiment.,Tervonen T; Fox RJ; Brooks A; Sidorenko T; Boyanova N; Levitan B; Hennessy B; Phillips-Beyer A,"BACKGROUND: Treatment decisions for multiple sclerosis (MS) are influenced by many factors such as disease symptoms, comorbidities, and tolerability. OBJECTIVE: To determine how much relapsing MS patients were willing to accept the worsening of certain aspects of their MS in return for improvements in symptoms or treatment convenience. METHODS: A web-based discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in patients with relapsing MS. Multinomial logit models were used to estimate relative attribute importance (RAI) and to quantify attribute trade-offs. RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 817 participants from the US, the UK, Poland, and Russia. The most valued attributes of MS therapy to participants were effects on physical fatigue (RAI = 22.3%), cognitive fatigue (RAI = 22.0%), relapses over 2 years (RAI = 20.7%), and MS progression (RAI = 18.4%). Participants would accept six additional relapses in 2 years and a decrease of 7 years in time to disease progression to improve either cognitive or physical fatigue from ""quite a bit of difficulty"" to ""no difficulty."" CONCLUSION: Patients strongly valued improving cognitive and physical fatigue and were willing to accept additional relapses or a shorter time to disease progression to have less fatigue.

Older adult patient preferences for the content and format of prescription medication labels - A best-worst scaling and discrete choice experiment study.,Malhotra R; Suppiah SD; Tan YW; Sung P; Tay SSC; Tan NC; Koh GC; Chan A; Chew LST; Ozdemir S,"BACKGROUND: Patient preferences for the content and format of prescription medication labels (PMLs, i.e., sticker labels placed on medication bottles/packets at dispensing) have been extensively studied. However, accommodating all preferences on PMLs is impractical due to space limitations. Understanding how patients prioritise the content and format attributes of PMLs can inform improvements while working within PML space constraints. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to (1) identify a ranking of medication-related content attributes to be prioritised on PMLs using best-worst scaling (BWS), and (2) determine the relative importance of format attributes when incorporated onto PMLs using discrete choice experiment (DCE), from the perspective of older adult patients in Singapore. METHODS: Attributes were informed by our prior qualitative study and PML best practice guidelines. For the BWS component, the assessed content attributes were indication, precautions, interaction or paired medicines, food instructions, side effects, expiry date, and missed dose action, all of which are currently not legally mandated on PMLs in Singapore. A BWS object case was used to rank the content attributes. For the DCE component, in a series of questions, participants were asked to choose between two PML options each time, that varied in the presentation of dosage-frequency instructions, font size, presentation of dosage, presentation of precautions, and font colour of precautions. A mixed logit model estimated the relative utilities of format attribute levels, enabling the calculation of importance scores of the format attributes. RESULTS: The study recruited 280 participants (mean age: 68.8 ± 5.4 years). The three most-preferred content attributes were indication, precautions and interaction or paired medicines. The top three format preferences were tabular style presentation of dosage-frequency instructions, large font size and precautions in red colour. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare institutions should consider improving their PMLs based on the leading content and format preferences voiced by older adult patients. The methodology adopted in the study can also be used for aligning the content and format of other patient education materials with patient preferences.",2023,Nov,Res Social Adm Pharm,19,11,1455-1464,,10.1016/j.sapharm.2023.07.009,37507340,#734,Malhotra 2023,,,1
"A Prospective, Randomized Single-Blind Crossover Study Comparing High-Frequency 10,000 Hz and Burst Spinal Cord Stimulation.",Braun E; Khatri N; Kim B; Nazir N; Orr WN; Ballew A; Latif U; Sack A; Sowder T; Canova K; Clark S; Grace P; Khan TW,"OBJECTIVES: Although both high-frequency and burst spinal cord stimulation (SCS) have shown improved efficacy and patient satisfaction compared with conventional tonic stimulation, there are limited data directly comparing the two. This study aimed to compare both high-frequency 10,000 Hz and burst SCS in the same patients in terms of pain relief and satisfaction in those with axial back pain with or without leg pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted at an outpatient pain clinic within an academic medical center. Participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups in which they trialed either burst or high-frequency 10,000 Hz SCS over five days, followed by a 24- to 48-hour washout period with no stimulation, and the alternative therapy over the remaining four days. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were collected immediately before and after both therapy trials. Secondary end points included percentage change in VAS score and patient preference. RESULTS: Of 25 participants, those receiving burst followed by high-frequency SCS (n = 11) had a mean VAS difference of 4.73 after the first trial period and 2.86 after the second. Of those receiving high-frequency followed by burst SCS (n = 14), mean VAS difference after the first trial period was 4.00 and 1.93 after the second trial period. Four participants were withdrawn owing to lead migration. Both therapies showed statistically significant differences in pre- minus post-VAS scores and percent relief. There were no significant differences in carryover or treatment effects between the two groups. There was a statistically significant association between trial sequence and stimulator type implanted because the first stimulator trialed was more likely to be chosen. CONCLUSIONS: There were no observed differences in VAS pain score decrease when comparing burst and high-frequency 10,000 Hz SCS programming therapies. Patient preference followed an order effect, favoring the first programming therapy in the trial sequence.",2023,Jul,Neuromodulation,26,5,1023-1029,,10.1016/j.neurom.2022.10.054,36494306,#1137,Braun 2023,,,0
Category of upper eyelid morphology and the preferred double eyelid shape in Asians according to questionnaire survey.,Zhao S; Zheng D; Wang S; Yan X; Ge H; Tan Q,"BACKGROUND: The morphological classification of the upper eyelid in Asian people is complex and diverse and usually not consistent with what we know well. AIMS: To improve the classification of upper eyelid morphology and investigate the preferred double eyelid shape by Asian people. METHODS: An investigation of 640 patients' preferences for double eyelid shape was conducted, and the pre- and post-operative effects were assessed. The shapes of the natural eyelids of 247 people (485 eyes) who provided real photographs of the eyelids were counted. The chi-square test was used to analyze the differences. RESULTS: There were 10 eyelid shapes: single eyelid, parallel-shaped double eyelid, fan-shaped double eyelid, parallel fan-shaped double eyelid, opened fan-shaped double eyelid, crescent-shaped double eyelid, hidden-shaped double eyelid, horizontal-shaped double eyelid, triangle-shaped double eyelid, and multiple-fold eyelid. The difference in the shape of the natural eyelid between males and females was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The most popular eyelid shapes were single eyelid (24.9%), open fan-shaped double eyelid (21.0%), fan-shaped double eyelid (16.3%), and hidden-shaped double eyelid (12.6%). Men and women preferred a parallel fan-shaped double eyelid (18.0%), a parallel-shaped double eyelids (17.0%), and an open fan-shaped double eyelids (18.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The most popular upper eyelid shapes were single eyelid, open fan-shaped double eyelid, and fan-shaped double eyelid. The parallel fan-shaped, parallel-shaped, and open fan-shaped double eyelid were favored by men and women.",2023,Dec,J Cosmet Dermatol,22,12,3362-3368,,10.1111/jocd.15822,37205629,#642,Zhao 2023,,,0
Efficacy of Vaccine Protection Against COVID-19 Virus Infection in Patients with Chronic Liver Diseases.,Cheung CKM; Law KWT; Law AWH; Law MF; Ho R; Wong SH,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 is a useful weapon to combat the virus. Patients with chronic liver diseases (CLDs), including compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis and noncirrhotic diseases, have a decreased immunologic response to coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines. At the same time, they have increased mortality if infected. Current data show a reduction in mortality when patients with chronic liver diseases are vaccinated. A suboptimal vaccine response has been observed in liver transplant recipients, especially those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, so an early booster dose is recommended to achieve a better protective effect. Currently, there are no clinical data comparing the protective efficacy of different vaccines in patients with chronic liver diseases. Patient preference, availability of the vaccine in the country or area, and adverse effect profiles are factors to consider when choosing a vaccine. There have been reports of immune-mediated hepatitis after coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination, and clinicians should be aware of that potential side effect. Most patients who developed hepatitis after vaccination responded well to treatment with prednisolone, but an alternative type of vaccine should be considered for subsequent booster doses. Further prospective studies are required to investigate the duration of immunity and protection against different viral variants in patients with chronic liver diseases or liver transplant recipients, as well as the effect of heterologous vaccination.",2023,Jun,J Clin Transl Hepatol,11,3,718-735,,10.14218/JCTH.2022.00339,36969905,#1147,CheungCKM 2023,,,0
Obesity Management in Adults: A Review.,Elmaleh-Sachs A; Schwartz JL; Bramante CT; Nicklas JM; Gudzune KA; Jay M,"IMPORTANCE: Obesity affects approximately 42% of US adults and is associated with increased rates of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, sleep disorders, osteoarthritis, and premature death. OBSERVATIONS: A body mass index (BMI) of 25 or greater is commonly used to define overweight, and a BMI of 30 or greater to define obesity, with lower thresholds for Asian populations (BMI ≥25-27.5), although use of BMI alone is not recommended to determine individual risk. Individuals with obesity have higher rates of incident cardiovascular disease. In men with a BMI of 30 to 39, cardiovascular event rates are 20.21 per 1000 person-years compared with 13.72 per 1000 person-years in men with a normal BMI. In women with a BMI of 30 to 39.9, cardiovascular event rates are 9.97 per 1000 person-years compared with 6.37 per 1000 person-years in women with a normal BMI. Among people with obesity, 5% to 10% weight loss improves systolic blood pressure by about 3 mm Hg for those with hypertension, and may decrease hemoglobin A1c by 0.6% to 1% for those with type 2 diabetes. Evidence-based obesity treatment includes interventions addressing 5 major categories: behavioral interventions, nutrition, physical activity, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic/bariatric procedures. Comprehensive obesity care plans combine appropriate interventions for individual patients. Multicomponent behavioral interventions, ideally consisting of at least 14 sessions in 6 months to promote lifestyle changes, including components such as weight self-monitoring, dietary and physical activity counseling, and problem solving, often produce 5% to 10% weight loss, although weight regain occurs in 25% or more of participants at 2-year follow-up. Effective nutritional approaches focus on reducing total caloric intake and dietary strategies based on patient preferences. Physical activity without calorie reduction typically causes less weight loss (2-3 kg) but is important for weight-loss maintenance. Commonly prescribed medications such as antidepressants (eg, mirtazapine, amitriptyline) and antihyperglycemics such as glyburide or insulin cause weight gain, and clinicians should review and consider alternatives. Antiobesity medications are recommended for nonpregnant patients with obesity or overweight and weight-related comorbidities in conjunction with lifestyle modifications. Six medications are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for long-term use: glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 (GLP-1) agonists (semaglutide and liraglutide only), tirzepatide (a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/GLP-1 agonist), phentermine-topiramate, naltrexone-bupropion, and orlistat. Of these, tirzepatide has the greatest effect, with mean weight loss of 21% at 72 weeks. Endoscopic procedures (ie, intragastric balloon and endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty) can attain 10% to 13% weight loss at 6 months. Weight loss from metabolic and bariatric surgeries (ie, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) ranges from 25% to 30% at 12 months. Maintaining long-term weight loss is difficult, and clinical guidelines support the use of long-term antiobesity medications when weight maintenance is inadequate with lifestyle interventions alone. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Obesity affects approximately 42% of adults in the US. Behavioral interventions can attain approximately 5% to 10% weight loss, GLP-1 agonists and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/GLP-1 receptor agonists can attain approximately 8% to 21% weight loss, and bariatric surgery can attain approximately 25% to 30% weight loss. Comprehensive, evidence-based obesity treatment combines behavioral interventions, nutrition, physical activity, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic/bariatric procedures as appropriate for individual patients.",2023,Nov,JAMA,330,20,2000-2015,,10.1001/jama.2023.19897,38015216,#656,Elmaleh-Sachs 2023,,,0
Patients' Perspectives Regarding Generator Exchanges of Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators.,Montembeau SC; Merchant FM; Speight C; Kramer DB; Matlock DD; Horný M; Dickert NW; Rao BR,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making is mandated for patients receiving primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). Less attention has been paid to generator exchange decisions, although at the time of generator exchange, patients' risk of sudden cardiac death, risk of procedural complications, quality of life, or prognosis may have changed. This study was designed to explore how patients make ICD generator exchange decisions. METHODS: Emory Healthcare patients with primary prevention ICDs implanted from 2013 to 2021 were recruited to complete in-depth interviews exploring perspectives regarding generator exchanges. Interviews were conducted in 2021. Transcribed interviews were qualitatively coded using multilevel template analytic methods. To investigate benefit thresholds for pursuing generator exchanges, patients were presented standard-gamble type hypothetical scenarios where their ICD battery was depleted but their 5-year risk of sudden cardiac death at that time varied (10%, 5%, and 1%). RESULTS: Fifty patients were interviewed; 18 had a prior generator exchange, 16 had received ICD therapy, and 17 had improved left ventricular ejection fraction. As sudden cardiac death risk decreased from 10% to 5% to 1%, the number of participants willing to undergo a generator exchange decreased from 48 to 42 to 33, respectively. Responses suggest that doctor's recommendations are likely to substantially impact patients' decision-making. Other drivers of decision-making included past experiences with ICD therapy and device implantation, as well as risk aversion. Therapeutic inertia and misconceptions about ICD therapy were common and represent substantive barriers to effective shared decision-making in this context. CONCLUSIONS: Strong defaults may exist to continue therapy and exchange ICD generators. Updated risk stratification may facilitate shared decision-making and reduce generator exchanges in very low-risk patients, especially if these interventions are directed toward clinicians. Interventions targeting phenomena such as therapeutic inertia may be more impactful and warrant exploration in randomized trials.",2023,Aug,Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes,16,8,509-518,,10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.122.009827,37492959,#1002,Montembeau 2023,,,1
Evaluation of patient participation in relation to the implementation of a person-centered nursing shift handover.,Lantz AH; Gunningberg L; Eriksson G; Eldh AC; Wenemark M; Pöder U,"BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that nursing shift-to-shift handover should be a more team-based dialogue with and for the patient rather than about a patient. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate patient participation in relation to the implementation of the person-centered handover (PCH). METHOD: A pretest-posttest design was used without a comparison group, including patients from nine units in a university hospital at pretest (n = 228) and after implementing PCH (posttest, n = 253) per the framework integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services. The PCH is inspired by an Australian bedside handover model. The Patient Preferences for the Patient Participation tool was used to rate the preference for and experience of participation on 12 items, combined into three levels of preference-based participation (insufficient-fair-sufficient). RESULTS: There were no differences regarding experience or preference-based participation between patients at pretest-posttest; however, posttest patients experienced participation in the item Reciprocal communication to a lesser extent than the pretest patients. Only 49% of the posttest group received PCH; of those not receiving PCH, some would have wanted PCH (27%), while some would have declined (24%). Patients receiving PCH had sufficient participation (82%), to a greater extent, regarding the item Sharing one's symptoms with staff than patients at pretest (72%). Patients receiving PCH also had sufficient participation, to a greater extent, than patients at posttest who did not receive, but would have wanted PCH, regarding four items: (1) sharing one's symptoms with staff, (2) reciprocal communication, (3) being told what was done, and (4) taking part in planning. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Most patients want to be present at PCH. Therefore, nurses should ask for the patients' preferences regarding PCH and act accordingly. Not inviting patients who want PCH could contribute to insufficient patient participation. Further studies are needed to capture what assistance nurses would want in identifying and acting in alignment with patient preferences.",2023,Aug,Worldviews Evid Based Nurs,20,4,330-338,,10.1111/wvn.12666,37431567,#1004,Lantz 2023,,,0

Ablation versus Radiation Segmentectomy for Small Liver Tumors.,Ozen M; Patel RK,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a liver malignancy that affects more than a million people worldwide with a complex multifactorial etiology. After the diagnosis of HCC is made, physicians establish management using the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) guidelines revolving around tumor stage, liver function, performance status, and patient preferences. According to recent updates to these guidelines, thermal ablation is the second-best curative option apart from surgical resection for small HCC (< 2 cm). While thermal ablation is standard of care, recent studies have suggested that radiation segmentectomy (RS) has similar outcomes, limited hepatotoxicity, and ultimately a cost-efficient approach. Although there is limited literature on RS, this article compares ablation techniques against radiation segmentectomy for small HCC tumors.",2023,Dec,Semin Intervent Radiol,40,6,511-514,,10.1055/s-0043-1777714,38274221,#459,Ozen 2023,,,0
Understanding Patient Preferences Regarding the Important Determinants of Breast Cancer Treatment: A Narrative Scoping Review.,Yeo HY; Liew AC; Chan SJ; Anwar M; Han CH; Marra CA,"OBJECTIVE: Conventionally, optimal treatment strategies for breast cancer have been largely determined by physicians, with a scant understanding of patients' treatment values and preferences. Incorporating patient preferences in the decision-making process for breast cancer treatment is gaining recognition and can potentially improve treatment outcomes and compliance. This scoping review aims to synthesize evidence on the key determinants that are most valued by breast cancer patients when deciding on their treatment options. METHODS: We searched three electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and CINAHL Plus) utilizing a systematic scoping review method. Two reviewers independently screened, applied inclusion criteria, reviewed, and synthesized findings. A mixed-method narrative approach combining the inductive thematic analysis and content analysis methodologies was used to synthesize and summarize the findings. RESULTS: The review included 22 studies, leading to the conceptualization of 5 overarching themes and 17 sub-themes. Among these, the most frequently cited theme was treatment benefits, followed by treatment-related process, treatment-related risk, quality of life, and cost of treatment. Women with breast cancer highly value treatments that offer good effectiveness, prolong survival, prevent recurrence, and maintain quality of life. Patient concerns include treatment-related side effects, safety, the risk of secondary cancer, and direct or indirect out-of-pocket costs. Additionally, patients also consider treatment duration, mode of administration, physician recommendation, and treatment availability and accessibility when deciding on their preferred treatment. CONCLUSION: The evidence synthesized in this review offers insights into refining breast cancer treatment strategies to align more closely with patient values. Recognizing and integrating patient perspectives in breast cancer care could potentially lead to improved treatment outcomes, enhanced patient compliance, and more personalized care. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to incorporate these key determinants in their treatment decision-making processes, aiming to deliver a patient-centered care that aligns with the unique preferences and values of each patient.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,2679-2706,,10.2147/PPA.S432821,37927344,#756,Yeo 2023,,,1

The key recommendations from IWWM-11 CP2 include: (1) Chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) and/or a covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase (cBTKi) strategies are important options; their use should reflect the prior upfront strategy and are subject to their availability. (2) In selecting treatment, biological age, co-morbidities and fitness are important; nature of relapse, disease phenotype and WM-related complications, patient preferences and hematopoietic reserve are also critical factors while the composition of the BM disease and mutational status (MYD88, CXCR4, TP53) should also be noted. (3) The trigger for initiating treatment in RRWM should utilize knowledge of patients' prior disease characteristics to avoid unnecessary delays. (4) Risk factors for cBTKi related toxicities (cardiovascular dysfunction, bleeding risk and concurrent medication) should be addressed when choosing cBTKi. Mutational status (MYD88, CXCR4) may influence the cBTKi efficacy, and the role of TP53 disruptions requires further study) in the event of cBTKi failure dose intensity could be up titrated subject to toxicities. Options after BTKi failure include CIT with a non-cross-reactive regimen to one previously used CIT, addition of anti-CD20 antibody to BTKi, switching to a newer cBTKi or non-covalent BTKi, proteasome inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors, and new anti-CD20 combinations are additional options.

A Smartphone-Gamified Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy Augmented With Biofeedback for Ailurophobia: Development and Evaluation Study.,Khaleghi A; Narimani A; Aghaei Z; Khorrami Banaraki A; Hassani-Abharian P,"BACKGROUND: To the best of our knowledge, no specialized research has been conducted to address ailurophobia (fear of cats) in Iran or globally. This has driven our project, along with the prevalence of ailurophobia and the absence of a gamified virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) that incorporates affordable and easily accessible biofeedback (BF) tools. We hypothesize that a gamified VRET augmented with BF will yield more positive effects than a similar device lacking BF. OBJECTIVE: This study primarily focuses on the development and preliminary evaluation of a smartphone-gamified VRET integrated with BF, targeting animal phobia, with a specific case study on ailurophobia. The secondary objectives are using affordable and readily available BF found in devices such as smart bands and smartwatches and creating a mobile virtual reality gamified app to improve patients' adherence to treatments while simultaneously enhancing the app's accessibility, scalability, and outreach. METHODS: Evaluations encompassed 3 methods. First, we identified the tool's potential positive effects on phobia interventions, exploring 4 effects: intrinsic motivation, simulation of fearful situations, management of stressful circumstances without therapists' presence and mitigation of catastrophic thoughts, and preliminary effects on ailurophobia treatment. Participants were divided into BF and non-BF groups. Second, we gathered user preferences and opinions about the treatment. Third, we conducted heuristic evaluations using 44 heuristics from existing system usability scales assessing user interfaces, virtual reality platforms, and video games' playability. To interpret the data, mean scores; ANOVA, single factor; and ANOVA, 2-factor with replication were used. A total of 29 individuals were identified, of which 10 met the eligibility criteria or were accessible. RESULTS: The smartphone-gamified VRET augmented with BF exhibited better results on the identified effects compared with the non-BF version and contributed to normalizing encounters with cats. Moreover, 41 of the 44 heuristics achieved a percentage above 62%, indicating its potential as a therapeutic product and its ability to enhance patient adherence to treatments. Patient preferences on the treatment and its strengths and weaknesses were provided for further improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The tool has the potential to evolve into a comprehensive solution by incorporating various types of cats and their behaviors, simulating environments in which they are commonly found, and enhancing its appeal through an increased sense of adventure without inducing unrealistic fears. By adapting fear elements, the game can be tailored to treat various animal phobias. Phobia-focused games should avoid action and combat scenarios to prevent reinforcement of fear responses. After rigorous evaluation, further exploration is required to provide remote use beyond clinical settings.",2024,Mar,JMIR Serious Games,12,,e34535,,10.2196/34535,38446522,#257,Khaleghi 2024,,,0
Evaluation of Preference and Utility Measures for Transoral Thyroidectomy.,Wu V; Samargandy S; Philteos J; Pasternak JD; de Almeida JR; Monteiro E,"BACKGROUND: Traditional, trans-cervical thyroidectomy results in the presence of a neck scar, which has been shown to correlate with lower quality of life and lower patient satisfaction. Transoral thyroid surgery (TOTS) has been utilized as an alternative approach to avoid a cutaneous incision and scar by accessing the neck and thyroid through the oral cavity. This study was designed to evaluate patient preference through health-state utility scores for TOTS as compared to conventional trans-cervical thyroidectomy. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patient preferences were elicited for TOTS and trans-cervical thyroidectomy with the use of an online survey. Respondents were asked to consider 4 hypothetical health scenarios involving thyroid surgery with varying approaches. Health-state utility scores were elicited using visual analog scale and standard gamble exercises. RESULTS: Overall, 516 respondents completed the survey, of whom 261 (50.6%) were included for analysis, with a mean age of 41.5 years (SD 14.9 years), including 171 (65.5%) females. Health utility scores were similar for TOTS and conventional transcervical techniques. Statistically significant differences in the standard gamble utility score were noted for gender and ethnicity across all scenarios. Comparisons of visual analog score utilities were not statistically significant based on respondent demographics. CONCLUSION: Preferences for TOTS and trans-cervical thyroidectomy did not significantly differ in the current study. Females and white ethnicity indicated stronger preference for a TOTs approach compared to males and other ethnicities, respectively. Some literature suggests certain types of patients who might prefer minimally invasive thyroidectomy more so than other patients-in keeping with the current findings of this study.",2023,Apr,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,132,4,381-386,,10.1177/00034894221094950,35503808,#1386,Wu 2023,,,1
Identifying patient preferences for diabetes care: A protocol for implementing a discrete choice experiment in Samoa.,Rivara AC; Galárraga O; Selu M; Arorae M; Wang R; Faasalele-Savusa K; Rosen R; Hawley NL; Viali S,"In Samoa, adult Type 2 diabetes prevalence has increased within the past 30 years. Patient preferences for care are factors known to influence treatment adherence and are associated with reduced disease progression and severity. However, patient preferences for diabetes care, generally, are understudied, and other patient-centered factors such as willingness-to-pay (WTP) for diabetes treatment have never been explored in this setting. Discrete Choice Experiments (DCE) are useful tools to elicit preferences and WTP for healthcare. DCEs present patients with hypothetical scenarios composed of a series of multi-alternative choice profiles made up of attributes and levels. Patients choose a profile based on which attributes and levels may be preferable for them, thereby quantifying and identifying locally relevant patient-centered preferences. This paper presents the protocol for the design, piloting, and implementation of a DCE identifying patient preferences for diabetes care, in Samoa. Using an exploratory sequential mixed methods design, formative data from a literature review and semi-structured interviews with n = 20 Samoan adults living with Type 2 diabetes was used to design a Best-Best DCE instrument. Experimental design procedures were used to reduce the number of choice-sets and balance the instrument. Following pilot testing, the DCE is being administered to n = 450 Samoan adults living with diabetes, along with associated questionnaires, and anthropometrics. Subsequently, we will also be assessing longitudinally how preferences for care change over time. Data will be analyzed using progressive mixed Rank Order Logit models. The results will identify which diabetes care attributes are important to patients (p < 0.05), examine associations between participant characteristics and preference, illuminate the trade-offs participants are willing to make, and the probability of uptake, and WTP for specific attributes and levels. The results from this study will provide integral data useful for designing and adapting efficacious diabetes intervention and treatment approaches in this setting.",2023,,PLoS One,18,12,e0295845,,10.1371/journal.pone.0295845,38134044,#552,Rivara 2023,,,1
A scoping review of shared care models for rheumatoid arthritis with patient-initiated follow-up.,Bhangu G; Hartfeld NMS; Lacaille D; Lopatina E; Hoens AM; Barber MRW; Then KL; Zafar S; Fifi-Mah A; Hazlewood G; Barber CEH,"OBJECTIVE: An emerging strategy to address access challenges to rheumatologists for patients with RA is shared care between primary and specialist care, with patient-initiated rheumatologist follow-up as needed. The objective of this scoping review was to explore studies implementing this model of care. METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched from 01/01/2000-31/03/2022 using three main concepts (RA, shared care, patient-initiated follow-up). English-language studies of any design were included if they described the implementation and/or outcomes of shared care model for RA with patient-initiated follow-up. Two authors reviewed and selected articles in duplicate and extracted data on study characteristics, care model implementation and outcomes according to a pre-specified protocol. RESULTS: Following duplicate removal, 1578 articles were screened for inclusion and 58 underwent full-text review. Sixteen articles were included, representing 10 unique studies. Five studies had qualitative outcomes and two were pre-implementation studies. Model implementation varied significantly between studies. Effectiveness data was available in 10 studies and demonstrated equivalent outcomes for the model of care (disease activity, radiographic damage, quality of life). Health system costs were equivalent or lower than usual care. While satisfaction with care was equivalent or improved in shared care models with patient-initiated follow-up, some concerns were expressed in qualitative evaluation around appropriate patient selection for such models, and information for health equity evaluation was not reported. CONCLUSIONS: While shared care models with patient-initiated follow-up may offer comparable outcomes for RA, further work is required to understand patient preferences, health equity considerations and longer-term outcomes for such models of care.",2023,Jun,Semin Arthritis Rheum,60,,152190,,10.1016/j.semarthrit.2023.152190,36934470,#1202,Bhangu 2023,,,0
"Introduction of the L-PAP Flap: Bipedicled, Conjoined, and Stacked Thigh-Based Flaps for Autologous Breast Reconstruction.",Chu CK; Largo RD; Lee ZH; Adelman DM; Egro F; Winocour S; Reece EM; Selber JC; Butler CE,"SUMMARY: Thigh-based flaps are increasingly popular options for autologous breast reconstruction in the setting of abdominal donor-site inadequacy, previous surgery, or patient preference, but the volume and skin associated with these flaps are often lacking relative to the abdomen. An individualized, shared decision-making approach to donor-site selection was adopted based on body shape, surgical history, lifestyle, reconstructive needs, and patient expectations. Different thigh-based flaps combined in stacked, bipedicled, or conjoined configurations were selected to maximize efficient use of available soft-tissue skin and volume while optimizing donor-site aesthetics. A total of 23 thigh-based stacked, bipedicled, or conjoined profunda artery perforator (PAP), lateral thigh perforator (LTP), or gracilis musculocutaneous flap components were used in six patients. Configurations included bilateral stacked PAP and LTP flaps, bipedicled posterolateral thigh flaps based on the LTP and PAP (L-PAP), and bipedicled thigh flaps based on the gracilis and PAP pedicles. Most anastomoses were performed to the antegrade and retrograde internal mammary vessels; intraflap anastomoses were performed in one case. There were no partial or total flap losses. There was one donor-site seroma. Design of stacked, bipedicled, and conjoined thigh-based flaps using multiple conventional flap components allows for tailored approaches to donor-site utilization based on individual body shape in selected patients. Bipedicled design with the L-PAP flap represents one strategy in appropriate cases to overcome skin and volume deficiencies while facilitating coning and projection.

Clinical documentation of patient identities in the electronic health record: Ethical principles to consider.,Decker SE; Farook MW; Meshberg-Cohen S; Matsuura T; Manning M; Abel EA; Blakley L; Prelli F,"The American Psychological Association's multicultural guidelines encourage psychologists to use language sensitive to the lived experiences of the individuals they serve. In organized care settings, psychologists have important decisions to make about the language they use in the electronic health record (EHR), which may be accessible to both the patient and other health care providers. Language about patient identities (including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation) is especially important, but little guidance exists for psychologists on how and when to document these identities in the EHR. Moreover, organizational mandates, patient preferences, fluid identities, and shifting language may suggest different documentation approaches, posing ethical dilemmas for psychologists to navigate. In this article, we review the purposes of documentation in organized care settings, review how each of the five American Psychological Association Code of Ethics' General Principles relates to identity language in EHR documentation, and propose a set of questions for psychologists to ask themselves and their patients when making choices about documenting identity variables in the EHR.

Development of a haemophilia A gene therapy shared decision-making tool for clinicians.,Limjoco J; Thornburg CD,"INTRODUCTION: As gene therapies are incorporated into clinical practice, shared decision-making (SDM) is recommended for implementation. AIM: To inform development of a clinician SDM tool for haemophilia A gene therapy. METHODS: Clinicians at US Hemophilia Treatment Centers completed semi-structured interviews about their experience with SDM and provided feedback on a clinician SDM tool prototype. Interviews were transcribed verbatim for coding and thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Ten participants enrolled, eight physicians and two haemophilia nurses. All participants care for adults with haemophilia (1-27 years of experience) and 7 have gene therapy trials open at their institution. Confidence in having a clinical discussion about gene therapy included none (N = 1), slight (N = 3), moderate (N = 5) and high (N = 1). All participants reported familiarity with SDM and agreed that the tool would be useful for their clinical practice. Key themes in participant feedback for the tool were (1) language and presentation; (2) content; and (3) implementation. Participants highlighted the importance of providing unbiased information and having companion tools with patient-centric language. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the need for SDM tools for haemophilia A gene therapy. Key information to include in the tool are safety, efficacy, cost and detailed information on the gene therapy process. Data should be provided in an unbiased format and allow comparison to other treatments. The tool will be evaluated in clinical practice and refined as clinical trial data and real-world experience mature.",2023,Sep,Haemophilia,29,5,1184-1190,,10.1111/hae.14822,37401924,#924,Limjoco 2023,,,0
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Dental Preferences of Patients at Private University Hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",Olayan AA; Baseer MA; Ingle NA,"Studies that particularly look into how the pandemic has affected Saudi Arabian patients' dental preferences are scarce. The majority of the research done so far has focused on the pandemic's broad effects on oral health rather than the specific changes in patient preferences for dental care. Therefore, the primary goal of the study was to examine how patients at a private university dental hospital underwent dental procedures both before and after the pandemic. The study is a retrospective analysis of patient data from March 2019 to February 2022 obtained from electronic hospital records (Dentoplus). The data extracted information pertaining to the number of patients and their periodic visits. The data was examined via statistical tests. At 0.05, the significance level was chosen. According to the research, compared to non-lockdown times, lockdown times saw a considerable drop in the number of patients scheduling appointments. There was also a significant decrease in the number of first-time patients during lockdown periods. The study also revealed a significant increase in the number of cancelled appointments and patients who discontinued treatment during lockdown periods. The age and gender of the patients did not have a significant effect on these findings. The study's findings suggest that dental professionals need to be aware of these changes in patient behavior and adapt their services accordingly. Dental clinics may need to focus on promoting their services and ensuring that patients feel safe and comfortable seeking dental care during the pandemic.",2023,May,Cureus,15,5,e39435,,10.7759/cureus.39435,37362498,#1227,Olayan 2023,,,0
Large-scale retrospective analysis of methodological factors affecting pregnancy rates after embryo transfer for in vitro fertilization.,Kavrut M; Sagir FG; Atayurt Z,"This study aimed to investigate the impact of methodological factors on pregnancy rates after embryo transfer (ET) for in vitro fertilization. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2020 and April 2022. A total of 2048 patients who underwent ultrasonography-guided first frozen embryo transfer (FET) or a fresh ET cycle due to infertility were included in the study. The effects of age, ET protocol (frozen or fresh), preimplantation genetic testing, number of embryos transferred (NET), and embryo fundus distance on pregnancy rate were investigated. The mean age of pregnant patients (31.51 ± 5.28) was significantly lower than that of non-pregnant patients (35.34 ± 6.39) (P < .001). Multiple regression analysis showed that women with lower age (P < .001), higher NET (P < .001), higher embryo fundus distance (P < .001), FET (P < .001), and preimplantation genetic testing (P = .012) had a significantly higher likelihood of pregnancy. Appropriate transfer depth, younger age, euploid embryo transfer, FET, and a higher NET can increase the likelihood of pregnancy. However, multiple factors must be considered when deciding the best protocol for a particular patient, including patient preference, costs and timing.",2023,Sep,Medicine (Baltimore),102,36,e35146,,10.1097/MD.0000000000035146,37682170,#885,Kavrut 2023,,,0
"Trial of labor after cesarean, vaginal birth after cesarean, and the risk of uterine rupture: an expert review.",Deshmukh U; Denoble AE; Son M,"The decision to pursue a trial of labor after cesarean delivery is complex and depends on patient preference, the likelihood of successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery, assessment of the risks vs benefits of trial of labor after cesarean delivery, and available resources to support safe trial of labor after cesarean delivery at the planned birthing center. The most feared complication of trial of labor after cesarean delivery is uterine rupture, which can have catastrophic consequences, including substantial maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Although the absolute risk of uterine rupture is low, several clinical, historical, obstetrical, and intrapartum factors have been associated with increased risk. It is therefore critical for clinicians managing patients during trial of labor after cesarean delivery to be aware of these risk factors to appropriately select candidates for trial of labor after cesarean delivery and maximize the safety and benefits while minimizing the risks. Caution is advised when considering labor augmentation and induction in patients with a previous cesarean delivery. With established hospital safety protocols that dictate close maternal and fetal monitoring, avoidance of prostaglandins, and careful titration of oxytocin infusion when induction agents are needed, spontaneous and induced trial of labor after cesarean delivery are safe and should be offered to most patients with 1 previous low transverse, low vertical, or unknown uterine incision after appropriate evaluation, counseling, planning, and shared decision-making. Future research should focus on clarifying true risk factors and identifying the optimal approach to intrapartum and induction management, tools for antenatal prediction, and strategies for prevention of uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean delivery. A better understanding will facilitate patient counseling, support efforts to improve trial of labor after cesarean delivery and vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates, and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean delivery.",2024,Mar,Am J Obstet Gynecol,230,3S,S783-S803,,10.1016/j.ajog.2022.10.030,38462257,#274,Deshmukh 2024,,,0
Do Patients Want to Be Involved in Their Carpal Tunnel Surgery Decisions? A Multicenter Study.,Roe AK; Eppler SL; Kakar S; Akelman E; Got CJ; Blazar PE; Ruch DS; Richard MJ; Yao J; Kamal RN,"PURPOSE: Carpal tunnel syndrome requires multiple decisions during its management, including regarding preoperative studies, surgical technique, and postoperative wound management. Whether patients have varying preferences for the degree to which they share in decisions during different phases of care has not been explored. The goal of our study was to evaluate the degree to which patients want to be involved along the care pathway in the management of carpal tunnel syndrome. METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter study of patients undergoing carpal tunnel surgery at 5 academic medical centers. Patients received a 27-item questionnaire to rate their preferred level of involvement for decisions made during 3 phases of care for carpal tunnel surgery: preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative. Preferences for participation were quantified using the Control Preferences Scale. These questions were scored on a scale of 0 to 4, with patient-only decisions scoring 0, semiactive decisions scoring 1, equally collaborative decisions scoring 2, semipassive decisions scoring 3, and physician-only decisions scoring 4. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients completed the survey between November 2018 and April 2019. Overall, patients preferred semipassive decisions in all phases of care (median score, 3). Patients preferred equally collaborative decisions for preoperative decisions (median score, 2). Patients preferred a semipassive decision-making role for intraoperative and postoperative decisions (median score, 3), suggesting these did not need to be equally shared. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome prefer varying degrees of involvement in the decision-making process of their care and prefer a semipassive role in intraoperative and postoperative decisions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Strategies to engage patients to varying degrees for all decisions during the management of carpal tunnel syndrome, such as decision aids for preoperative surgical decisions and educational handouts for intraoperative decisions, may facilitate aligning decisions with patient preferences for shared decision-making.",2023,Nov,J Hand Surg Am,48,11,1162.e1-1162.e8,,10.1016/j.jhsa.2022.03.025,35672175,#752,Roe 2023,,,0
Preferences and Adherence of People with Prediabetes for Disease Management and Treatment: A Systematic Review.,Ren Z; Xu X; Yue R,"OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively summarize the evaluation, preference, and expectations of people with prediabetes regarding the management and treatment of pre-diabetes. METHODS: Search PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and CNKI for articles about prediabetes, preferences, and expectations from inception of the database to June 2023. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies involving 17,240 participants with prediabetes were included. Although the preferences and views of people with prediabetes vary widely, there are certain trends: 1) Compared with drug therapy, people with prediabetes prefer exercise and nutrition therapies. 2) People with prediabetes expect intensive lifestyle interventions guided by professionals. 3) Effective communication between doctors and people with prediabetes is crucial for promoting the development and implementation of treatment plans. CONCLUSION: The results of this systematic review showed that people with prediabetes prefer intensive lifestyle interventions due to concerns about drug side effects, dependency, and other factors. In addition, drug acceptance and lifestyle interventions options differed among different populations, which emphasized the significance of individualized therapy.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,2981-2989,,10.2147/PPA.S437267,38027075,#682,Ren 2023,,,1
Literature review and guide for optimal position in implant-based breast reconstruction.,King CA; Masanam MK; Tousimis EA; Salzberg CA,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Identification of ideal candidates for prepectoral versus retropectoral implant-based breast reconstruction relies on careful preoperative risk assessment and intraoperative flap evaluation. Few guidelines exist to guide the surgeon's decision-making process when evaluating the preferred plane for implant placement. METHODS: A literature review was performed to develop clinical decision-making algorithms for direct-to-implant (DTI) reconstruction with acellular dermal matrix (ADM) for patients undergoing prophylactic or therapeutic nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) based on patient characteristics, surgical techniques, and outcomes. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: Prepectoral reconstruction is most suitable for patients with small breasts or macromastia with desire for breast reduction, low-grade ptosis, smaller implant sizes, those undergoing PMRT, and for those who aim to mitigate animation deformity and capsular contracture. Retropectoral reconstruction may be recommended for patients with larger breasts with no desire for size change requiring additional prosthesis support, and in patients who aim to reduce likelihood of rippling and need for subsequent fat grafting procedures to address contour abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Careful preoperative and intraoperative assessment of reconstruction options for patients undergoing implant-based breast reconstruction is necessary to mitigate complications and produce superior aesthetic outcomes. Decision algorithms may be used to determine ideal surgical techniques based on patient factors, like radiation history and planning, breast size and ptosis, and patient preferences.",2023,Aug,Gland Surg,12,8,1082-1093,,10.21037/gs-23-78,37701292,#957,King 2023,,,0
Scoping review of values elicitation tools for treatment decisions in hepatocellular carcinoma.,Ritaccio G; Barritt Iv AS; Conklin JL; Richardson DR; Evon DM; Sanoff HK; Basch E; Wheeler SB; Moon AM,"BACKGROUND: Treatment choices in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) involve consideration of tradeoffs between the benefits, toxicities, inconvenience, and costs. Stated preference elicitation methods have been used in the medical field to help evaluate complex treatment decision-making. The aim of this study was to conduct a scoping review to assess the evidence base for the use of preference elicitation tools or willingness to pay/willingness to accept methods for HCC treatment decision-making from both the patient and provider perspective. METHODS: We performed a scoping review to identify abstracts or manuscripts focused on the role preference elicitation tools or willingness to pay/willingness to accept methods for HCC treatment options among patients, caregivers, and/or providers. Two researchers independently screened full-text references and resolved conflicts through discussion. We summarized key findings, including the type and setting of preference-elicitation tools used for HCC treatment decisions. RESULTS: Ten published abstracts or manuscripts evaluated the role of preference elicitation tools for HCC treatments. The studies revealed several attributes that are considered by patients and providers making HCC treatment decisions. Many of the studies reviewed suggested that while patients place the most value on extending their overall survival, they are willing to forgo overall survival to avoid risks of treatments and maintain quality of life. Studies of physicians and surgeons found that provider preferences are dependent on patient characteristics, provider specialty, and surgeon or hospital-related factors. CONCLUSION: This scoping review explored both patient and physician preferences towards treatment modalities in all stages of HCC. The studies revealed a large scope of potential attributes that may be important to patients and that many patients are willing to forgo survival to maintain quality of life. Further research should explore both preference elicitation of currently available and emerging therapies for HCC as well as the use of this data to develop patient-facing tools to assist in navigating treatment options.",2024,Feb,BMC Gastroenterol,24,1,90,,10.1186/s12876-024-03167-1,38418997,#333,Ritaccio 2024,,,1
Patient Preferences for Pain Control After Mohs Micrographic Surgery: A Single-Center Discrete Choice Experiment.,Nugent ST; Veerabagu SA; Madden M; Yanes AF; Etzkorn JR; Miller CJ; Sobanko JF; Shin TM; Higgins HW 2nd; McMurray SL; Walker JL; Zhang J; Giordano CN,"IMPORTANCE: Patient preferences for pain medications after Mohs micrographic surgery are important to understand and have not been fully studied. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient preferences for pain management with only over-the-counter medications (OTCs) or OTCs plus opioids after Mohs micrographic surgery given varying levels of theoretical pain and opioid addiction risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective discrete choice experiment was conducted in a single academic medical center from August 2021 to April 2022 among patients undergoing Mohs surgery and their accompanying support persons (≥18 years). A prospective survey was administered to all participants using the Conjointly platform. Data were analyzed from May 2022 to February 2023. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The primary outcome was the pain level at which half of the respondents chose OTCs plus opioids equally to only OTCs for pain management. This pain threshold was determined for varying opioid addiction risk profiles (low, 0%; low-moderate, 2%; moderate-high, 6%; high, 12%) and measured via a discrete choice experiment and linear interpolation of associated parameters (pain levels and risk of addiction). RESULTS: Of the 295 respondents (mean [SD] age, 64.6 [13.1] years; 174 [59%] were female; race and ethnicity were not considered) who completed the discrete choice experiment, 101 (34%) stated that they would never consider opioids for pain management regardless of the pain level experienced, and 147 (50%) expressed concern regarding possible opioid addiction. Across all scenarios, 224 respondents (76%) preferred only OTCs vs OTCs plus opioids after Mohs surgery for pain control. When the theoretical risk of addiction was low (0%), half of the respondents expressed a preference for OTCs plus opioids given pain levels of 6.5 on a 10-point scale (90% CI, 5.7-7.5). At higher opioid addiction risk profiles (2%, 6%, 12%), an equal preference for OTCs plus opioids and only OTCs was not achieved. In these scenarios, patients favored only OTCs despite experiencing high levels of pain. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this prospective discrete choice experiment indicate that the perceived risk of opioid addiction affects the patient's choice of pain medications after Mohs surgery. It is important to engage patients undergoing Mohs surgery in shared decision-making discussions to determine the optimal pain control plan for each individual. These findings may encourage future research on the risks associated with long-term opioid use after Mohs surgery.",2023,Aug,JAMA Dermatol,159,8,848-853,,10.1001/jamadermatol.2023.1899,37405725,#1005,Nugent 2023,,,1
Migraine Patient Care Model Preferences in a Community Practice.,Stern JI; Ebbert JO; Vierkant RA; Young NP,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Developing high-value care models with limited resources for large populations of individuals with migraine requires advanced understanding of patient preferences for care delivery methods. In this study, we aimed to inform the development of migraine care models by assessing patient preferences for types of care delivery and determining differences based on migraine frequency and disability. METHODS: We analyzed unpublished data from a cross-sectional survey of 516 randomly selected individuals with migraine within a community practice associated with Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. RESULTS: Individuals with chronic migraine, compared with those with episodic migraine, were more likely to prefer a visit with a neurologist (p = 0.0005), synchronous telephone conference with primary care provider (PCP) and neurologist (p = 0.0102), and a written migraine action plan in the medical record (p = 0.0343). Compared with those with mild/no disability, individuals with moderate-to-severe disability were more likely to prefer a visit with a neurologist (p < 0.0001), synchronous video or telephone conference with PCP and neurologist (p < 0.0001), PCP communication with neurologist (p = 0.0099), electronic message to primary care team with access to neurologist (p = 0.0216), and written action plan in the medical record (p = 0.0011). Collectively, individuals most preferred telephone follow-up and least preferred communications with a nurse or pharmacist or generalized education (all p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: We observed differences in migraine care delivery preferences between migraine frequency and level of migraine disability. Observations support development of care pathways that include a written migraine action plan, primary care-neurology collaboration including nontraditional interactions, and prioritization of traditional neurology consultation for the most disabled patients.",2023,Apr,Neurol Clin Pract,13,2,e200131,,10.1212/CPJ.0000000000200131,37064592,#1341,Stern 2023,,,0
Public preferences in healthcare resource allocation: A discrete choice experiment in South Korea.,Bae EY; Lim MK; Lee B; Bae G; Hong J,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the public view on priority-setting criteria for healthcare resource allocation. Specifically, it investigates how the value of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) varies depending on patient characteristics. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was conducted using an online sample of the general South Korean population. Respondents were presented with two competing treatment scenarios. The attributes of the scenarios were age at disease onset, life expectancy without treatment, life-years gain with treatment, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) without treatment, and HRQoL gains with treatment. Two hundred choice sets were generated and randomly allocated into 20 blocks. A conditional logit model was used to estimate the factors affecting the respondents' choices. RESULTS: A total of 3,482 respondents completed the survey. The larger the QALY gain, the more likely it was that the scenario would be chosen but with a diminishing marginal value. Respondents prioritized 40-year-old patients over 5-year-olds and 5-year-olds over 70-year-olds and prioritized baseline HRQoL of 40% and 60% over 20%. Patients at the end of life were not preferred to those with a longer life expectancy. CONCLUSION: Overall, respondents preferred health-maximizing options without explicit consideration for end-of-life patients or those with poor health. In addition, they revealed a kinked preference for patient age, prioritizing middle-aged patients over children and older people.",2023,Dec,Health Policy,138,,104932,,10.1016/j.healthpol.2023.104932,37924559,#604,Bae 2023,,,1
Talking technology: exploring chatbots as a tool for cataract patient education.,Yılmaz IBE; Doğan L,"CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Worldwide, millions suffer from cataracts, which impair vision and quality of life. Cataract education improves outcomes, satisfaction, and treatment adherence. Lack of health literacy, language and cultural barriers, personal preferences, and limited resources may all impede effective communication. BACKGROUND: AI can improve patient education by providing personalised, interactive, and accessible information tailored to patient understanding, interest, and motivation. AI chatbots can have human-like conversations and give advice on numerous topics. METHODS: This study investigated the efficacy of chatbots in cataract patient education relative to traditional resources like the AAO website, focusing on information accuracy,understandability, actionability, and readability. A descriptive comparative design was used to analyse quantitative data from frequently asked questions about cataracts answered by ChatGPT, Bard, Bing AI, and the AAO website. SOLO taxonomy, PEMAT, and the Flesch-Kincaid ease score were used to collect and analyse the data. RESULTS: Chatbots scored higher than AAO website on cataract-related questions in terms of accuracy (mean SOLO score ChatGPT: 3.1 ± 0.31, Bard: 2.9 ± 0.72, Bing AI: 2.65 ± 0.49, AAO website: 2.4 ± 0.6, (p < 0.001)). For understandability (mean PEMAT-U score AAO website: 0,89 ± 0,04, ChatGPT 0,84 ± 0,02, Bard: 0,84 ± 0,02, Bing AI: 0,81 ± 0,02, (p < 0.001)), and actionability (mean PEMAT-A score ChatGPT: 0.86 ± 0.03, Bard: 0.85 ± 0.06, Bing AI: 0.81 ± 0.05, AAO website: 0.81 ± 0.06, (p < 0.001)) AAO website scored better than chatbots. Flesch-Kincaid readability ease analysis showed that Bard (55,5 ± 8,48) had the highest mean score, followed by AAO website (51,96 ± 12,46), Bing AI (41,77 ± 9,53), and ChatGPT (34,38 ± 9,75, (p < 0.001)). CONCLUSION: Chatbots have the potential to provide more detailed and accurate data than the AAO website. On the other hand, the AAO website has the advantage of providing information that is more understandable and practical.

Timing of the Initial Postoperative Care After Cataract Surgery: A Patient's Perspective.,Rush SW; Huseman S; Rush RB,"PURPOSE: To evaluate patient preferences in regards to the timing of the initial postoperative examination after undergoing cataract surgery. METHODS: A retrospective, consecutive case series analysis from a single private practice institution was performed using a standardized phone survey on patients who underwent cataract surgery. Subjects were classified into one of two possible study groups according to the timing of their initial postoperative cataract surgery examination: Group A received the initial postoperative cataract surgery examination on the same day as the surgery, whereas Group B received the initial postoperative cataract surgery examination on the day following the operation. RESULTS: There were 80 subjects contacted for the phone survey of which 70 (35 in each study group) completed the survey and therefore were included in the analysis. Group A subjects responded favorably in regards to preference and realizing reduced time and cost savings compared to Group B (p < 0.0001 for both). There were no subjects in Group A who would have preferred next-day initial postoperative care, whereas 31.4% of subjects in Group B would have preferred same-day care if given the opportunity. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing cataract surgery both prefer and report time and cost savings with same-day initial postoperative care compared to next-day initial postoperative care. Patient preferences regarding their postoperative care should be one of the many factors that a surgeon ought to take into consideration when providing follow-up care after cataract surgery.",2023,,Clin Ophthalmol,17,,1475-1479,,10.2147/OPTH.S413602,37256196,#1225,Rush 2023,,,0
Patients' Preferences Towards Decision Counseling for Active Surveillance After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Esophageal Cancer.,Hermus M; van der Zijden CJ; Wijnhoven BPL; Busschbach JJ; Lagarde SM; Kranenburg LW,"BACKGROUND: Decision counseling (DC) is offered to enable patients to reflect on their treatment preferences and to think through the consequences of alternative treatment options. However, the timing of DC is debatable. In this study, patients who underwent DC at different times were interviewed about their experiences, specifically focusing on the timing of DC. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer eligible for participation in a prospective cohort study on active surveillance (SANO-2 study) were offered DC either before or after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). Structured interviews were conducted by phone 1 week after DC, and responses were analyzed using frequency counts for the answers to set response categories. The primary outcome was the preferred time to receive DC, while the secondary outcome was the overall experience of patients with DC. RESULTS: Overall, 40 patients were offered DC between 2021 and 2023. Patients who had counseling before the start of nCRT (n = 20) were satisfied with the timing of DC. Of the 20 patients who had DC after nCRT, 6 would have preferred counseling at an earlier time point. Patients who had DC both before or after the completion of nCRT reflected positively on DC. CONCLUSION: It is recommended to introduce the option of DC as early as possible and discuss with the patient at which moment during the decision-making process they prefer to discuss all treatment options more extensively.",2024,Mar,Ann Surg Oncol,31,3,1562-1567,,10.1245/s10434-023-14651-5,38099991,#303,Hermus 2024,,,0
Mixed methods study of attitudes on location of gynaecological oncology outpatient care: a patient and healthcare professional questionnaire.,Newhouse R; Cullimore V; Hotton E; Maxwell H; Jones E; Morrison J,"OBJECTIVE: Gynaecological oncology place of care is often based on evolution of services, along historical professional boundaries, rather than user needs or preferences. We aimed to assess existing evidence, gather views of patients in the UK on their preferred place of outpatient care for gynaecological malignancies and evaluate alignment with preferences of healthcare professionals (HCP). METHODS: We performed a mixed methods study, including a scoping review, a patient survey and a healthcare practitioner questionnaire. We collected quantitative and qualitative data, performing content analysis to determine current practice and impact on patients. RESULTS: No studies were identified in our scoping review. We received responses from 159 patients and 54 gynaecological oncology HCPs. There was a strong preference for a dedicated gynaecological oncology setting (89% somewhat or very happy) (p<0.0001). Fifty-three percent of patients were somewhat or very unhappy to have care colocated with general obstetrics and gynaecology services. Specifically, two key themes were identified through content analysis of qualitative data from patients: 'environment and getting this right is vital'; and 'our cancer should be the priority'. HCPs underestimated the strong patient preference to be seen in dedicated units. Of those who see patients within general obstetrics and gynaecology, only 50% said patients were seen at separate times/locations from obstetric patients. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the significant impact of place of care on gynaecological oncology patients, which may be underestimated by HCPs.",2024,Jan,BMJ Open Qual,13,1,,,10.1136/bmjoq-2023-002539,38232984,#467,Newhouse 2024,,,0

OBJECTIVE: To compare surgical scars treated with fractional carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) laser performed on Day 0 and Day 14. METHODS: Prospective, randomized, split-scar, physician-blinded study of 30 surgical scars on the limbs. Scars halves received fractional CO 2 laser on either Day 0 or Day 14. Scar assessment at 6 months evaluated patient preference, physician modified Manchester Scar Scale (MMSS) score, and quantitative scar analysis on histology (fractal dimension [F D ] and lacunarity [L] analysis). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in patient assessment (54% preferred Day 0 side, 46% preferred Day 14 side, p = .58) or physician assessment (mean MMSS 8.4 for Day 0 vs 8.7 for Day 14, p = .28). Fractal dimensions were similar for both interventions (mean 1.778 for Day 0 vs 1.781 for Day 14, p = .80). Lacunarity was similar for both interventions (mean 0.368 for Day 0 vs 0.345 for Day 14, p = .44).

"Photography in dermatology - a scoping review: Practices, skin of color, patient preferences, and medical-legal considerations.",Kashetsky N; Mar K; Liu C; Rivers JK; Mukovozov I,"Clinical photography is essential in dermatology. However, a comprehensive literature review of photography in dermatology is lacking. This scoping review aims to summarize the literature regarding photography practices in dermatology, photography of skin of color, patient preferences, and medical-legal considerations. A search was conducted utilizing Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Evidence Based Medicine databases in accordance with the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews. In total, 33 studies were summarized. Clinical photography is commonly used in biopsy site marking, assessment, diagnosis, disease monitoring, evaluation of treatment response, medical education, research, seeking advice from colleagues, and teledermatology. Although dermatologic photography remains devoid of skin of color representation, photographic considerations for darker skin are available. Most patients support medical photography, with a preference for clinical photographs to be taken by their own physicians, and for use of clinic/hospital-owned cameras over personal devices. Pertinent medical-legal issues include concerns around privacy, personal device use, and documentation of consent. Photography in dermatology is continuously evolving with broader applications.

The study aimed to describe factors that, from the patient's perspective, could increase the attendance rate and regularity of participation in the colorectal cancer screening programme (SP); (2) Methods: The qualitative approach was applied. The study involved six focus interviews conducted with 24 respondents (12 women and 12 men) aged 40-49, who had at least one first-degree family member diagnosed with CRC and persons aged 50-65, living in five selected voivodships (provinces) of Poland. The collected data were thematically coded. Further, a comparative analysis was conducted, and aggregated statements were formulated; (3) Results: The inclusion of primary care clinics within the CRC SP organization was reported as a key factor in improving the attendance rate and regularity of patient participation in the programme. Particularly important factors included an invitation in the form of a personal letter or a phone call made by staff from primary care clinics; (4) Conclusions: Patients were confirmed to have clear expectations and preferences for the organizational conditions of the CRC SP. Preferences nature allows them to be treated as one of the potential criteria for selecting critical parameters of CRC SPs.",2023,Jan,Healthcare (Basel),11,3,,,10.3390/healthcare11030371,36766948,#1576,Gac 2023,,,0
Epilepsy surgery perceptions among general neurologists and epilepsy specialists: A survey.,Haneef Z; Patel K; Nguyen A; Kayal G; Martini SR; Sullivan-Baca E,"OBJECTIVE: Surgical intervention for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) is a safe and efficacious evidence-based treatment. Yet, neurologists have historically revealed hesitance in referring patients for surgical evaluations. The present study surveyed general neurologists and epilepsy specialists to assess their views and process in referring patients for specialized epilepsy care and epilepsy surgery. METHODS: A 14-item survey assessing epilepsy referrals and views of epilepsy surgery was distributed to all neurologists currently practicing in a large national integrated health system using REDCap. Responses were qualitatively analyzed and differences between general neurologists and epileptologists were assessed using chi-squared tests. RESULTS: In total, 100 responses were received from 67 general neurologists and 33 epileptologists with several similarities and differences emerging between the two groups. Both groups endorsed surgery and neuromodulation as treatment options in DRE, felt that seizure frequency rather than duration was relevant in considering epilepsy surgery, and indicated patient preference as the largest barrier limiting epilepsy surgery. General neurologists were more likely to require ≥ 3 ASMs to fail to diagnose DRE compared to epileptologists (45% vs. 15%, p < 0.01) who more often required ≥ 2 ASMs to fail. Epileptologists were also more likely than neurologists to try a new ASM (75.8% vs. 53.7%, p < 0.05) or optimize the current ASM (75.8% vs. 49.3%, p < 0.05) in DRE. General neurologists were more likely to consider epilepsy surgery to be less efficacious (p = 0.001) or less safe (p < 0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, neurologists appear to have generally positive opinions of epilepsy surgery, which is a change from prior literature and represents a changing landscape of views toward this intervention. Furthermore, epileptologists and general neurologists endorsed more similarities than differences in their opinions of surgery and steps to referral, which is another encouraging finding. Those gaps that remain between epileptologists and general neurologists, particularly in standards of ASM prescription, may be addressed by more consistent education about DRE and streamlining of surgical referral procedures.",2024,Feb,Clin Neurol Neurosurg,237,,108151,,10.1016/j.clineuro.2024.108151,38340429,#401,Haneef 2024,,,0
Patient preferences for stress urinary incontinence treatments: a discrete choice experiment.,Boyers D; Kilonzo M; Davidson T; Cooper D; Wardle J; Bhal K; N'Dow J; MacLennan G; Norrie J; Abdel-Fattah M,"OBJECTIVES: To elicit and value patient preferences for the processes and outcomes of surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women. DESIGN: A discrete choice experiment survey to elicit preferences for type of anaesthesia, postoperative recovery time, treatment success, adverse events, impact on daily activities and cost. An experimental design generated 40 choice tasks, and each respondent completed 1 block of 10 and 2 validity tests. Analysis was by multinomial logistical regression. SETTING: N=21 UK hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: N=325 adult women who were a subsample of those randomised to the single-incision mini-slings clinical trial. OUTCOMES: Patient preferences; valuation obtained using willingness to pay. RESULTS: N=227 of 325 (70%) returned a questionnaire, and 94% of those completed all choice tasks. Respondents preferred general anaesthesia, shorter recovery times, improved stress urinary incontinence symptoms and avoidance of adverse events. Women were willing to pay (mean (95% CI)) £76 (£33 to £119) per day of reduction in recovery time following surgery. They valued increases in Patient Global Impression of Improvement, ranging from £8173 (£5459 to £10 887) for 'improved' to £11 706 (£8267 to £15 144) for 'very much improved' symptoms, compared with no symptom improvement. This was offset by negative values attached to the avoidance of complications ranging between £-8022 (£-10 661 to £-5383) and £-10 632 (£-14 077 to £-7187) compared to no complications. Women valued treatments that reduced the need to avoid daily activities, with willingness to pay ranging from £-967 (£-2199 to £266) for rarely avoiding activities to £-5338 (£-7258 to £-3417) for frequently avoiding daily activities compared with no avoidance. CONCLUSION: This discrete choice experiment demonstrates that patients place considerable value on improvement in stress urinary incontinence symptoms and avoidance of treatment complications. Trade-offs between symptom improvement and adverse event risk should be considered within shared decision-making. The willingness to pay values from this study can be used in future cost-benefit analyses.

Communication Preferences During Pregnancy Care Among Patients With Primary Spanish Language: A Scoping Review.,Rivera L; Butler H; Salinas KE; Wade C; Bazan M; Larson E; Molina RL,"BACKGROUND: Qualified language service providers (QLSPs)-professional interpreters or multilingual clinicians certified to provide care in another language-are critical to ensuring meaningful language access for patients. Designing patient-centered systems for language access could improve quality of pregnancy care. OBJECTIVE: We synthesized and identified gaps in knowledge about communication preferences during pregnancy care among patients with Spanish primary language. METHODS: We performed a scoping review of original research studies published between 2000 and 2022 that assessed communication preferences in Spanish-speaking populations during pregnancy care. Studies underwent title, abstract, and full-text review by three investigators. Data were extracted for synthesis and thematic analysis. RESULTS: We retrieved 1,539 studies. After title/abstract screening, 36 studies underwent full-text review, and 13 of them met inclusion criteria. Two additional studies were included after reference tracing. This yielded a total of 15 studies comprising qualitative (n = 7), quantitative (n = 4), and mixed-methods (n = 4) studies. Three communication preference themes were identified: language access through QLSPs (n = 7); interpersonal dynamics and perceptions of quality of care (n = 9); and information provision and shared decision-making (n = 8). Although seven studies reported a strong patient preference to receive prenatal care from Spanish-speaking clinicians, none of the included studies assessed clinician Spanish language proficiency or QLSP categorization. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have assessed communication preferences during pregnancy care among patients with primary Spanish language. Future studies to improve communication during pregnancy care for patients with primary Spanish language require intentional analysis of their communication preferences, including precision regarding language proficiency among clinicians.",2024,Mar-Apr,Womens Health Issues,34,2,164-171,,10.1016/j.whi.2023.08.008,37827863,#316,Rivera 2024,,,0
Efficacy of different bowel preparation regimen volumes for colorectal cancer screening and compliance with European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy performance measures.,Theunissen F; Lantinga MA; Ter Borg PCJ; Ouwendijk RJT; Siersema PD; Bruno MJ,"BACKGROUND: Various volumes of bowel preparation are used in clinical practice. There is conflicting data on the effectiveness of individual regimens. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and compliance of currently used bowel preparations with the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) performance measures using data of the Dutch nationwide colorectal cancer screening (CRC) program. METHODS: In a prospective, multicenter endoscopy database, we identified all CRC screening colonoscopies performed in 15 Dutch endoscopy centers from 2016 to 2020. We excluded procedures without documented bowel preparation or the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) score. Bowel preparation regimens were categorized into three groups, that is, 4-L (polyethylene glycol (PEG)), 2-L (2-L PEG with ascorbic acid) and ≤1-L volumes (sodium picosulfate with magnesium citrate, 1L-PEG with sodium sulfate and ascorbic acid or oral sulfate solution). European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy performance measures included adequate BBPS score (≥6) (>90%), cecal intubation rate (CIR, >90%), adenoma detection rate (ADR, >25%) and polyp detection rate (PDR, >40%). Logistic regression was performed to identify predictive factors for adequate BBPS and patient discomfort. RESULTS: A total of 39,042 CRC screening colonoscopies were included. Boston Bowel Preparation Scale scores, CIR, ADR and PDR for 4L, 2L and ≤1L regimens all met the minimum ESGE performance measures standards. However, an adequate BBPS score was more frequently seen with 2L regimens (98.0%) as compared to 4L (97.1%) and ≤1L regimens (97.0%) (p < 0.001), respectively. In addition, CIR was higher for ≤1L (98.4%) versus 4L (97.7%) and 2L (97.9%) regimens (p = 0.001), ADR higher for lower volume (≤1L (60.0%) and 2L (61.2)) versus higher volume (4L (58.6%)) regimens (p < 0.001), and PDR higher for ≤1L (70.0%) and 2L (70.8%) versus 4L (67.2%) regimens (p < 0.001). Boston Bowel Preparation Scale for ≤1L regimens was higher when combined with bisacodyl (97.3%) than without (95.6%) (p < 0.001). Overall, bisacodyl use was independently associated with higher patient discomfort (odds ratios = 1.47, confidence intervals = 1.26-1.72). CONCLUSIONS: Despite variations in bowel preparation volumes, all regimens meet the minimum ESGE performance measures for bowel preparation and other quality parameters. Boston Bowel Preparation Scale can be further improved if ultra low volume regimens are combined with bisacodyl. The choice for either bowel preparation volume can therefore be based on volume-tolerance and patient preference.",2023,Jun,United European Gastroenterol J,11,5,448-457,,10.1002/ueg2.12386,37190897,#1192,Theunissen 2023,,,0
Perspectives of people with HIV and HIV clinicians on characteristics of antiretroviral treatment and HIV-related symptoms.,Galindo Puerto MJ; Puig J; Pérez-Molina JA; Fuster-Ruiz de Apodaca MJ,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess HIV symptoms from the perspective of both patients and HIV specialists and the impact of discontinuing antiretroviral treatment (ART) on symptomology. We gathered opinions from HIV specialists and people living with HIV about ideal ART parameters and treatment satisfaction. METHODS: Ex post-facto cross-sectional surveys were administered to 502 people living with HIV and 101 HIV clinicians in Spain (18 sites). RESULTS: The median age of participants with HIV was 43.2 years, 74.5% were male, and 91.6% had an undetectable viral load. The mean time since initiation of ART was 10.2 years. Between 54% and 67% of people living with HIV reported experiencing nervousness or anxiety, sadness, fatigue, sleep problems, or muscle/joint pain during the preceding 4 weeks. However, only 22%-27% of specialists acknowledged the presence of these symptoms. The most bothersome symptoms were related to mental health or the central nervous system. There were significant differences between the burden of symptoms reported by people living with HIV and those acknowledged by specialists. The symptoms that more frequently caused ART discontinuation were depression, dizziness, and sleep problems. Both people living with HIV and specialists prioritized ART efficacy and low toxicity, but their importance ratings differed for 5 of the 11 ART characteristics assessed. People living with HIV rated their satisfaction with ART at a mean (± standard deviation) of 8.9 ± 1.5 out of 10, whereas HIV specialists rated it lower, at 8.3 ± 0.7 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in HIV care and treatment, a large proportion of patients still experience symptoms. HIV specialists may not be fully aware of these. People living with HIV and HIV specialists are, overall, satisfied with ART. However, the importance they place on different ART characteristics may vary.",2024,Jan,HIV Med,,,,,10.1111/hiv.13609,38214438,#478,GalindoPuerto 2024,,,0
Clinical Inertia Among Outpatients With Heart Failure: Application of Treatment Nonintensification Taxonomy to EPIC-HF Trial.,Swat SA; Helmkamp LJ; Tietbohl C; Thompson JS; Fitzgerald M; McIlvennan CK; Harger G; Ho PM; Ahmad FS; Ahmad T; Buttrick P; Allen LA,"BACKGROUND: The contribution of clinical inertia to suboptimal guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study examined reasons for GDMT nonintensification and characterized clinical inertia. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of EPIC-HF (Electronically Delivered, Patient-Activation Tool for Intensification of Medications for Chronic Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction), a randomized clinical trial evaluating a patient-activation tool on GDMT utilization, we performed a sequential, explanatory mixed-methods study. Reasons for nonintensification among 4 medication classes were assigned according to an expanded published taxonomy using structured chart reviews. Audio transcripts of clinic encounters were analyzed to further characterize nonintensification reasons. Integration occurred during the interpretation phase. RESULTS: Among 292 HFrEF patients who completed a cardiology visit, 185 (63.4%) experienced no treatment intensification, of whom 90 (48.6%) had at least 1 opportunity for intensification of a medication class with no documented contraindication or barriers (ie, clinical inertia). Nonintensification reasons varied by medication class, and included heightened risk of adverse effects (range 18.2%-31.6%), patient nonadherence (range 0.8%-1.1%), patient preferences and beliefs (range 0.6%-0.9%), comanagement with other providers (range 4.6%-5.6%), prioritization of other issues (range 15.6%-31.8%), multiple categories (range 16.5%-22.7%), and clinical inertia (range 22.7%-31.6%). A qualitative analysis of 32 clinic audio recordings demonstrated common characteristics of clinical inertia: 1) clinician review of medication regimens without education or intensification discussions; 2) patient stability as justification for nonintensification; and 3) shorter encounters for nonintensification vs intensification. CONCLUSIONS: In this comprehensive study exploring HFrEF prescribing, clinical inertia is a main contributor to nonintensification within an updated taxonomy classification for suboptimal GDMT prescribing. This approach should help target strategies overcoming GDMT underuse.",2023,Nov,JACC Heart Fail,11,11,1579-1591,,10.1016/j.jchf.2023.06.022,37589610,#728,Swat 2023,,,0
Treatment Preferences of Adolescents and Young Adults with Depressive Symptoms: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,Waumans RC; Muntingh ADT; Veldwijk J; W Hoogendoorn A; van Balkom AJLM; Batelaan NM,"BACKGROUND: Depression in adolescents and young adults is common and causes considerable disease burden while hampering their development, leading to adverse consequences in later life. Although treatment is available, young people are a vulnerable group regarding uptake and completion of treatment. To improve this, insight into youth's preferences for treatment is essential. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate patient preferences for depression treatment in a Dutch sample aged 16-24 years using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). METHODS: The study was conducted in The Netherlands between October 2018 and June 2019, and included 236 adolescents and young adults with current depressive symptoms or previous treatment. The DCE included five attributes (treatment type, frequency of appointment, waiting time, effectiveness, evaluation of therapeutic alliance) with corresponding levels. Results were analysed using latent class analysis. RESULTS: Results show a general preference for individual psychotherapy, treatment with high frequency, high effectiveness, short waiting time and a standard evaluation of the therapeutic alliance ('click' with the therapist) early in treatment. Latent class analysis revealed three different patterns of preferences regarding treatment type and willingness to engage in therapy. The first class showed a strong preference for individual therapy. The second class, including relatively older, higher educated and treatment-experienced participants, preferred high frequency treatment and was more open to different forms of therapy. The third class, including lower educated, younger and treatment-naïve adolescents showed reluctance to engage in therapy overall and in group therapy specifically. CONCLUSION: In this DCE, three classes could be identified that share similar preferences regarding treatment effectiveness, waiting time and evaluation of the therapeutic alliance, but varied considerably in their preference for treatment type (individual, group, or combined psychotherapy) and their willingness to engage. The results from this study may inform mental health care providers and institutions and help optimize professional care for adolescents and young adults with depressive symptoms, improving engagement in this vulnerable group.",2023,Dec,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,,,,,10.1007/s40258-023-00857-x,38109008,#561,Waumans 2023,,,1
The cost of saying no: general practitioners' gatekeeping role in sickness absence certification.,Hoff EH; Kraft KB; Moe CF; Nylenna M; Østby KA; Mykletun A,"BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) have an important gatekeeping role in the Norwegian sickness insurance system. This role includes limiting access to paid sick leave when this is not justified according to sick leave criteria. 85% of GPs in Norway operate within a fee-for-service system that incentivises short consultations and high service provision. In this qualitative study, we explore how GPs practise the gatekeeping role in sickness absence certification. METHODS: Qualitative data was collected through six focus group interviews with 33 GPs, working in practices with a minimum of four practising GPs, in different geographical regions across Norway, including both urban and rural areas. Data was analysed using Braune and Clarke's thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Our results indicate that GPs' sick-listing decisions are largely driven by patient demand and preferences for sick leave. GPs reported that they rarely overrule patient requests for sickness absence, including in cases where such requests conflict with the GPs' opinion of whether sick leave is justified or benefits the patient. The degree of effort made to limit unjustified or non-beneficial sick leave seems to depend on the GPs' available time and perceived risk of conflict with the patient. GPs generally expressed dissatisfaction with their role as certifiers of sickness absence. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that GPs' decisions about sickness certification is largely driven by patient preferences. The GPs' gatekeeping function is limited to negotiations about grade and duration of absence spells.",2024,Feb,BMC Public Health,24,1,439,,10.1186/s12889-024-17993-1,38347474,#374,Hoff 2024,,,0

Understanding patient cost-sharing thresholds for diabetes treatment attributes via a discrete choice experiment.,Panchal R; Nguyen D; Ghule P; Li N; Giannouchos T; Pan RJ; Biskupiak J; Britton L; Nohavec R; Slager S; Ngorsuraches S; Brixner D,"BACKGROUND: The process used to prefer certain products across drug classes for diabetes is generally focused on comparative effectiveness and cost. However, payers rarely tie patient preference for treatment attributes to formulary management resulting in a misalignment of value defined by providers, payers, and patients. OBJECTIVES: To explore patients' willingness to pay (WTP) for the predetermined high-value and low-value type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatments within a health plan. METHODS: A cross-sectional discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey was used to determine patient preference for the benefit, risk, and cost attributes of T2DM treatments. A comprehensive literature review of patient preference studies in diabetes and a review of guidelines and medical literature identified study attributes. Patients and diabetes experts were interviewed and instructed to identify, prioritize, and comment on which attributes of diabetes treatments were most important to T2DM patients. The patients enrolled in a health plan were asked to respond to the survey. A multinomial logit model was developed to determine the relative importance and the patient's WTP of each attribute. The patients' relative values based on WTPs for T2DM treatments were calculated and compared with the treatments by a health plan. RESULTS: A total of 7 attributes were selected to develop a web-based DCE questionnaire survey. The responses from a total of 58 patients were analyzed. Almost half (48.3%) of the respondents took oral medications and injections for T2DM. The most prevalent side effects due to diabetes medications were gastrointestinal (43.1%), followed by weight gain (39.7%) and nausea (32.8%). Patients were willing to pay more for treatments with proven cardiovascular benefit and for the risk reduction of hospitalization from heart failure. On the other hand, they would pay less for treatments with higher gastrointestinal side effects. Patients were willing to pay the most for sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist agents and the least for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides information to better align patient, provider, and payer preferences in both benefit design and value-based formulary strategy for diabetes treatments. A preferred placement of treatments with cardiovascular benefits and lower adverse gastrointestinal side effects may lead to increased adherence to medications and improved clinical outcomes at a lower overall cost to both patients and their health plan.

SAMCEP Society consensus on the treatment of upper facial lines with botulinum neurotoxin type A: A tailored approach.,Braccini F; Catoni I; Belfkira F; Lagier J; Roze E; Paris J; Huth J; Bronsard V; Cartier H; David M; Galatoire O; Obadia D; Sabatier H; Sarfati E; Kestemont P; Winter C; Redaelli A,"BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNTA) treatments are well established, but injection techniques, target muscles, and toxin doses continue to evolve, with each refinement producing improvements in treatment outcomes. The recommendations in this consensus move away from standard templates and illustrate how to tailor treatments to individual patterns and strengths of muscle activity, and patient preferences. METHODS: Seventeen experts in the fields of plastic surgery, dermatology, ophthalmology, otorhinolaryngology, and neurology convened in 2022 to develop consensus-based recommendations for the use of botulinum toxin A for the treatment of horizontal forehead lines, glabellar frown lines, and crow's feet lines that reflect current clinical practice. The focus was on how to tailor injections to individual patients to optimize treatment outcomes. RESULTS: For each upper face indication, consensus members describe how to perform a dynamic assessment to optimize the dose and injection technique for each patient. A tailored treatment protocol is presented for commonly observed patterns of dynamic lines. Units of Inco are defined and the precise location of injection points, illustrated with the use of anatomical images. CONCLUSION: This consensus provides up-to-date recommendations on the tailored treatment of upper facial lines based on the latest research and collective clinical experience of the expert injectors. Optimal outcomes require thorough patient evaluation, both at rest and during animation, using both visual and tactile cues; detailed understanding of facial muscular anatomy and how opposing muscles interact; and use of a BoNTA with high precision to target identified zones of excess muscle activity.",2023,Oct,J Cosmet Dermatol,22,10,2692-2704,,10.1111/jocd.15768,37408173,#830,Braccini 2023,,,0
Timing of start of systemic treatment in patients with asymptomatic metastasized pancreatic cancer (TIMEPAN): a protocol of a multicenter prospective patient preference non-randomized trial.,Augustinus S; Broekman T; Creemers GJ; Daamen LA; van Dieren S; de Groot JB; Cirkel GA; Homs MYV; van Laarhoven HWM; van Leeuwen L; Los M; Luelmo SAC; van Oijen MGH; Spierings LEAM; de Vos-Geelen J; Besselink MG; Wilmink JW,,2023,Dec,Acta Oncol,62,12,1973-1978,,10.1080/0284186X.2023.2273898,37897803,#608,Augustinus 2023,"Martina Di Blasio  (2024-06-07 19:26:52)(Screen): Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the deadliest forms of cancer with a 5-year survival of less than 5% for patients with metastatic disease (mPDAC) [Citation1]. Due to increased use of imaging, the number of asymptomatic patients diagnosed with mPDAC cancer is increasing [Citation2–4]. In some cases the primary diagnosis of asymptomatic mPDAC is detected on a scan performed for an unrelated indication, but in many cases standard follow-up scans after the inclusion of patients in neo-adjuvant and adjuvant trials leads to the early diagnosis of metastases. To illustrate this, in the Netherlands 97% of patients after pancreatic surgery undergo imaging during follow-up to detect potential recurrence, subsequently 24% off the patients diagnosed with local or distant recurrence is asymptomatic at diagnosis [Citation5].

For these patients, palliative systemic treatment is the only tumor-targeted treatment option. Use of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GEM-NAB) or the FOLFIRINOX regimen (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan and leucovorin) increased survival up to 9–11 months, compared to 7 months for gemcitabine monotherapy [Citation6,Citation7]. Furthermore, in patients with symptomatic mPDAC, palliative chemotherapy can decrease tumor burden, and thereby diminish disease symptoms and improve quality of life (QOL) [Citation8]. Nevertheless, chemotherapeutic agents also have negative side effects. Use of modern multi-agents chemotherapies are associated with serious adverse events (i.e. grade 3–4), with an incidence up to 46% during FOLFIRINOX [Citation6]. Therefore, in patients with asymptomatic mPDAC, the potential benefits of palliative chemotherapy must be carefully weighed against the potential negative side effects.

To date it is unclear whether early start of treatment in asymptomatic cancer patients is associated with improved survival rates. A recent systematic review including asymptomatic cancer patients emphasized that only limited evidence is available on timing of treatment initiation in asymptomatic patients, only five studies have been performed on this topic [Citation9]. Within this limited available evidence, delayed start of chemotherapy did not worsen survival, while it could preserve QOL. For patients with asymptomatic mPDAC specifically, no literature is available on this topic. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of immediate versus delayed treatment on quality adjusted overall survival in patients with asymptomatic mPDAC.; ",,0
Muscle activity and rehabilitation in spinal stenosis (MARSS) after conservative therapy and surgical decompression with or without fusion: Protocol for a partially randomized patient preference trial on rehabilitation timing.,Kurz E; Schenk P; Brakopp F; Diers M; Klingel O; Bone S; Meisel HJ; Delank KS; Ullrich BW,"BACKGROUND: Patients affected by lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) suffer from a multifactorial degeneration of the lumbar spine resulting in narrowing of the neuroforamina and spinal canal, leading to various functional limitations. It remains unclear whether LSS patients after surgery would benefit from early post-operative rehabilitation, or if a delayed rehabilitation would be more advantageous. The purpose of this partially randomized patient preference trial is to evaluate the impact of post-operative rehabilitation timing as well as surgical intervention type on psychometric properties and functional outcomes in patients with LSS. METHODS: Data for this patient preference trial are collected before and after surgical (decompression only or decompression and fusion) and rehabilitative interventions as well as six, 12 and 24 months after completing rehabilitation. The study participants are patients diagnosed with LSS who are at least 18 years old. After a medical check-up, participants will complete patient-reported outcome measures (PAREMO-20, SIBAR, FREM-8, SF-12, SFI, ODI) and different functional assessments (functional reach test, loaded reach test, handgrip strength, standing balance control, 6-min walk test).

Alternatives to Opioids for Managing Pain.,Dey S; Vrooman BM,"The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) revised the definition of pain in 2020 as ""An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage.""  Ongoing or recurring pain for three or more months has been defined as chronic pain by the same organization.  In comparison, acute pain can have an abrupt onset and is usually short-lasting. Chronic pain problems usually manifest initially as acute pain, and many chronic pain conditions are associated with an intermittent acute flare-up of pain. Chronic pain is a widespread health problem, with approximately 100 million people in the United States suffering from chronic pain in 2008. About 13 to 50% of adults in the United Kingdom have been estimated to suffer from chronic pain. This leads to a significant economic toll through direct healthcare costs associated with treatment and lost productivity. The estimated economic burden ranged from $560 to $635 billion in 2010, which is much higher than that of diabetes, cardiac problems, or cancer. The goal of treatment for chronic pain is the reduction of pain intensity and the improvement of function and quality of life. Apart from efficacy, the adverse effects, side-effect profile, economic factors, and patient preference should also be considered during the selection of a treatment modality. Multimodal management has been recommended for chronic pain, including medications, exercises, lifestyle modification, physical therapy, pain psychology, behavioral modalities, interventional pain modalities, and alternative medicine.",2024,Jan,,,,,,,34662057,#539,Dey 2024,,,0

By doing so, we aim to engage the readership to think critically about this controversial topic and make informed, patient-centered decisions regarding the use of thickened fluids in dysphagia management.Result/Conclusion: We argue that, while the research evidence for the use of thickened fluids in dysphagia management continues to grow, perhaps our problem lies in trying to find one pure answer-to thicken or not to thicken. We encourage clinicians to move past arguments about the controversies of thickened fluids and, rather, use the current evidence base, including research evidence, clinical expertise, and patient preferences to support individuals with dysphagia to make informed choices about their oral intake, in the short and long term.",2023,Dec,Int J Speech Lang Pathol,,,1-5,,10.1080/17549507.2023.2287429,38073085,#572,Wallace 2023,,,0
"Which body functions and activities matter for stroke patients? Study protocol for best-Worst scalings to value core elements of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health.",Juhnke C; Mühlbacher AC,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is a common, serious, and disabling healthcare problem with increasing incidence and prevalence. Following a stroke, identifying the factors associated with decisions about rehabilitation interventions is important to assess rehabilitation after stroke. The aim is to guide clinical staff to make patient-centered decisions. Fundamentally, decision makers cannot draw on evidence to consider the relevance of distinct functions and activities from the patient's perspective. Until now, outcomes of rehabilitation are generally categorized using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). This can be seen as a conceptual basis for the assessment of health and disability. Since the ICF does not distinguish importance between these aspects there is a need to value the most important clinical factors as well as related activities from a patients and public perspective to help guide therapists in effectively designing post-acute rehabilitation care for individuals following stroke. The research question is which ICF body functions and activities are of value to stroke patients? Which trade-offs are patients willing to make within the core elements? Health preference research (HPR) answers the need to develop additional preference weights for certain ICF dimensions. Patient preference information (PPI) values health conditions based on the ICF from a patient perspective. METHODS: In this study we conduct three best-worst scaling (BWS) experiments to value body function and activities from patients' and public perspective. Out of all ICF dimensions this research covers health conditions relevant to stroke patients in terms of body function, perception, and activities of daily living. Stroke patients as well as members of the general population will be recruited to participate in the online BWS surveys. Fractional, efficient designs are applied regarding the survey design. Conditional and multinominal logit analyses will be used as the main analysis method, with the best-worst count analysis as a secondary analysis. The survey is being piloted prior to commencing the process of data collection. Results are expected by the autumn of 2023. DISCUSSION: The research will add to the current literature on clinical decision-making in stroke rehabilitation and the value of certain body functions as well as related activities in neurorehabilitation. Moreover, the study will show whether body functions and activities that are currently equally weighted in international guidelines are also equally important from the point of view of those affected, or whether there are disconcordances in terms of differences between public judgements and patients' preferences.",2023,,PLoS One,18,12,e0295267,,10.1371/journal.pone.0295267,38060585,#578,Juhnke 2023,Rosanna Irene Comoretto (2024-04-11 20:30:12)(Screen): è un protocollo; ,,1
Doctors' attitudes in the situation of delivering bad news: patients' experience and expectations.,Sobczak K; Leoniuk K,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of our research was to find out patients' preferences concerning their doctors' attitudes and behaviour as they deliver bad news to them. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In national research conducted from February to October 2017 using the computer-assisted web interview (CAWI) technique, we studied the statements of 314 adult patients who had received bad medical news from their doctors. Seventy-nine per cent of them were women and 21% were men. Fifty-nine per cent had higher education and 33% had secondary education. A specially designed closed question survey was used as a tool to collect the data. RESULTS: Most of the patients (59.6%) expected a doctor-patient relationship based on partnership and collective decisions concerning further treatment. Patients wanted their doctors to be honest with them, to provide them with solid information and an opportunity to ask questions and discuss the suggested solutions. Less than 2 out of 10 patients expected ""an empathy specialist"". The patients who evaluated their doctors' behaviour and the way bad news was delivered to them negatively were more likely to change doctors or terminate their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The doctor-patient relationship when an unfavourable diagnosis is being communicated is an important aspect, which defines the way people who participate in this difficult situation behave and communicate. Doctors' behaviour during DBN should meet the patients' expectations. Such an attitude guarantees trust towards doctors and results in more positive evaluations on them. Most importantly, it translates directly into the patients' therapeutic behaviours and treatment effects.",2023,,Arch Med Sci,19,4,921-929,,10.5114/aoms/112756,37560719,#1614,Sobczak 2023,,,0

Reproductive Planning: Contraceptive Counseling and Nonhormonal Methods.,Zhang Y; Wilson ML; Glass S; Godfrey EM,"More than 65% of US women ages 15 to 49 years use contraception every year, many of whom seek care with family medicine. Family physicians are well equipped to provide comprehensive contraceptive counseling to patients in the primary care setting. When discussing options and providing education to patients, clinicians should consider patient preferences, patient autonomy, and adverse effect concerns, and should use a patient-centered approach that upholds the principles of reproductive justice. Nonhormonal methods of contraception include barrier methods and spermicides, fertility awareness-based methods, and (in postpartum individuals) lactational amenorrhea. With barrier methods, spermicides, and fertility awareness-based methods, 13 to 29 out of 100 women may become pregnant. Permanent forms of contraception include female and male sterilization procedures, which are some of the most effective (more than 99% effective) and most commonly used methods in the United States.",2024,Mar,FP Essent,538,,7-12,,,38498324,#273,Zhang 2024,,,0
Preferences for risks and benefits of treatment outcomes for chronic low back pain: Choice-based conjoint measure development and discrete choice experiment.,Wilson L; Denham A; Ionova Y; O'Neill C; Greco CM; Hassett AL; Hanmer J; Shaikh S; Wolf M; Berven S; Williams D; Ma Y; Lotz J; Zheng P,"INTRODUCTION: Understanding individual patient preferences for chronic low back pain (cLBP) outcomes is essential for targeting available therapeutic options; yet tools to elicit patient outcome preferences are limited. OBJECTIVE: To develop and test a choice-based conjoint (CBC) measure, commonly used in behavioral economics research, to elicit what outcomes patients with cLBP want to achieve and avoid. DESIGN: We developed a survey-based CBC measure to allow patients to make risk/benefit trade-off choices between possible treatment outcomes. After extensive literature, clinician, and patient input, our measure included seven attributes: fatigue, anxiety/depression, difficulty thinking/making decisions, pain intensity, physical abilities, change in pain, and ability to enjoy life despite pain. Random-parameters logit models were used to estimate strength of preferences, and latent class analysis was used to identify patient characteristics associated with distinct preference. SETTING: Online study using the Sawtooth web-based platform. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eleven individuals with cLBP recruited from online advertising as well as at clinical sites across multiple academic and private institutions. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. RESULTS: The most valued outcome was the highest level of physical activity (β = 1.6-1.98; p < .001), followed by avoiding cognitive difficulties (β = -1.48; p < .001). Avoidance of severe pain was comparable to avoiding constant fatigue and near-constant depression/anxiety (β = -0.99, -1.02); p < .001). There was an association between preferences and current pain/disability status; patients with higher pain had a stronger preference to avoid severe pain, whereas those with higher disability have stronger preferences for achieving physical activity. The latent class analysis identified two distinct groups: (1) more risk-seeking and willing to accept worse outcomes (56%); and (2) more risk-averse with a stronger preference for achieving maximum benefits (44%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study illuminated cLBP patient preferences for treatment outcomes and heterogeneity in these preferences. Patients stressed the importance of reaching high physical activity and avoiding cognitive declines, even over a desire to avoid pain. More work is needed to understand patient preferences to aid informed, shared decisions.",2023,Dec,PM R,,,,,10.1002/pmrj.13112,38040670,#594,Wilson 2023,,,1
Parent's preferences for unscheduled paediatric healthcare: A discrete choice experiment.,Nicholson E; McDonnell T; Conlon C; De Brún A; Doherty E; McAuliffe E,"BACKGROUND: Unscheduled healthcare is a key component of healthcare delivery and makes up a significant proportion of healthcare access, with children being particularly high users of unscheduled healthcare. Understanding the relative importance of factors that influence this behaviour and decision-making is fundamental to ensuring the system is best designed to meet the needs of users and foster appropriate cost-effective usage of health system resources. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify the parent's preferences for unscheduled healthcare for a common mild childhood illness. DESIGN: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was developed to identify the preferences of parents accessing unscheduled healthcare for their children. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from parents in Ireland (N = 458) to elicit preferences across five attributes: timeliness, appointment type, healthcare professional attended, telephone guidance before attending and cost. RESULTS: Using a random parameters logit model, all attributes were statistically significant, cost (β = -5.064, 95% confidence interval, CI [-5.60, -4.53]), same-day (β = 1.386, 95% CI [1.19, 1.58]) or next-day access (β = 0.857, 95% CI [0.73, 0.98]), coupled with care by their own general practitioner (β = 0.748, 95% CI [0.61, 0.89]), identified as the strongest preferences of parents accessing unscheduled healthcare for their children. DISCUSSION: The results have implications for policy development and implementation initiatives that seek to improve unscheduled health services as understanding how parents use these services can maximise their effectiveness. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The development of the DCE included a qualitative research component to ensure that the content accurately reflected parents experiences when seeking healthcare. Before data collection, a pilot test was carried out with the target population to gather their views on the survey.",2023,Oct,Health Expect,26,5,1931-1940,,10.1111/hex.13802,37338038,#834,Nicholson 2023,,,1
Trans-pacific multicenter collaborative study of minimally invasive proximal versus total gastrectomy for proximal gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers.,Ikoma N; Grotz T; Kawakubo H; Kim HI; Matsuda S; Hirata Y; Nakao A; Williams LA; Wang XS; Mendoza T; Wang X; Badgwell BD; Mansfield PF; Hyung WJ; Strong VE; Kitagawa Y,"BACKGROUND: The current standard operation for proximal gastric and gastroesophageal junction (P/GEJ) cancers with limited esophageal extension is total gastrectomy (TG). TG is associated with impaired appetite and weight loss due to the loss of gastric functions such as production of ghrelin and with anemia due to intrinsic factor loss and vitamin B(12) malabsorption. Theoretically, proximal gastrectomy (PG) can mitigate these problems by preserving gastric function. However, PG with direct esophagogastric reconstruction is associated with severe postoperative reflux, delayed gastric emptying, and poor quality of life (QoL). Minimally invasive PG (MIPG) with antireflux techniques has been increasingly performed by experts but is technically demanding owing to its complexity. Moreover, the actual advantages of MIPG over minimally invasive TG (MITG) with regards to postoperative QoL are unknown. Our overall objective of this study is to determine the short-term QoL benefits of MIPG. Our central hypotheses are that MIPG is safe and that patients have improved appetite after MIPG with effective antireflux techniques, which leads to an overall QoL improvement when compared with MITG. METHODS: Enrollment of a total of 60 patients in this prospective survey-collection study is expected. Procedures (MITG versus MIPG, antireflux techniques for MIPG [double-tract reconstruction versus the double-flap technique]) will be chosen based on surgeon and/or patient preference. Randomization is not considered feasible because patients often have strong preferences regarding MITG and MIPG. The primary outcome is appetite level (reported on a 0-10 scale) at 3 months after surgery. With an expected 30 patients per cohort (MITG versus MIPG), this study will have 80% power to detect a one-point difference in appetite level. Patient-reported outcomes will be longitudinally collected (including questions about appetite and reflux), and specific QoL items, body weight, body mass index and ghrelin, albumin, and hemoglobin levels will be compared. DISCUSSION: Surgeons from the US, Japan, and South Korea formed this collaboration with the agreement that the surgical approach to P/GEJ cancers is an internationally important but controversial topic that requires immediate action. At the completion of the proposed research, our expected outcome is the establishment of the benefit and safety of MIPG.

An Overview of the Methodology Used to Develop Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Acute and Intraoperative Spinal Cord Injury.,Tetreault LA; Skelly AC; Alvi MA; Kwon BK; Evaniew N; Fehlings MG,"STUDY DESIGN: An overview of the methods used to develop clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). OBJECTIVES: Acute spinal cord injury (SCI) and intraoperative SCI (ISCI) can have devastating physical and psychological consequences for patients and their families. To date, there are several studies that have discussed the diagnostic and management strategies for both SCI and ISCI. CPGs in SCI help to distill and translate the current evidence into actionable recommendations, standardize care across centers, optimize patient outcomes, and reduce costs and unnecessary interventions. Furthermore, they can be used by patients to assist in making decisions about certain treatments and by policy makers to inform allocation of resources. The objective of this article is to summarize the methods used to develop CPGs for the timing of surgery and hemodynamic management of acute SCI, as well as the identification and treatment of ISCI. METHODS: The CPGs were developed using standards established by the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine), the Guideline International Network and several other organizations. Systematic reviews were conducted according to accepted methodological standards (eg, Institute of Medicine, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute) in order to summarize the current body of evidence and inform the guideline development process. Protocols for each guideline were created. A multidisciplinary guideline development group (GDG) was formed that included individuals living with SCI as well as clinicians from the broad range of specialties that encounter patients with SCI: spine or trauma surgeons, critical care physicians, rehabilitation specialists, neurologists, anesthesiologists and other healthcare professionals. Individuals living with SCI were also included in the GDG. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach was used to rate the certainty of the evidence for each critical outcome. The ""evidence to recommendation"" framework was then used to translate the evidence obtained from the systematic review to an actionable recommendation. This framework provides structure when assessing the body of evidence and considers several additional factors when rating the strength of the recommendation, including the magnitude of benefits and harms, patient preferences, resource use, health equities, acceptability and feasibility. Finally, the CPGs were appraised both internally and externally. RESULTS: The results of the CPGs for SCI are provided in separate articles in this focus issue. CONCLUSIONS: Development of these CPGs for SCI followed the methodology proposed by the Institute of Medicine the Guideline International Network and the GRADE Working Group. It is anticipated that these CPGs will assist clinicians implement the best evidence into practice and facilitate shared-decision making with patients.",2024,Mar,Global Spine J,14,3_suppl,25S-37S,,10.1177/21925682231215266,38526928,#270,Tetreault 2024,,,0
Patient-centered care outcomes for patients in the emergency department with a non-English language preference: A scoping review.,Schwei RJ; Hoang L; Wilson P; Greene MZ; Lor M; Shah MN; Pulia MS,"OBJECTIVE: This review highlights what is known about patient-centered care outcomes (PCCOs) for emergency department (ED) patients with non-English language preferences (NELP). METHODS: Four databases were searched and included article were written in English, presented primary evidence, published in a peer-reviewed journal, and reported PCCOs from the perspective of ED patients with NELP. PCCOs were defined using the Institute of Medicine definition, outcomes that evaluate respect and responsiveness to patient preferences, needs and values. Two reviewers assessed all articles, extracted data, and resolved discrepancies. PCCOs were grouped in categories (needs, preferences, and values) based on the definition's domains. RESULTS: Of the 6524 potentially eligible studies, 20 met inclusion criteria. Of these, 16 focused on needs; 4 on preferences and 8 on values. Within patient need, five studies found a large unmet need for language services. Within patient value, three found that language discordance negatively influenced perceptions of care. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies in this review found that not speaking English negatively influenced perceptions of care and highlighted a large unmet need for language services in the ED. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: More work needs to be done to characterize PCCOs in ED patients with NELP and develop interventions to improve care.",2023,Sep,Patient Educ Couns,114,,107875,,10.1016/j.pec.2023.107875,37399665,#925,Schwei 2023,,,0
Engaging psoriasis patients in adherence and outcomes to topical treatments: A summary from the Symposium 'Tailoring topical psoriasis treatments to patients' needs and expectations' of the 30(th) EADV Congress 2021.,Bewley A; van de Kerkhof P,"This article is based on a presentation given by authors at the Satellite Symposium titled 'Tailoring topical psoriasis treatments to patients' needs and expectations' held during the 30(th) European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress. During this session, the factors affecting adherence and outcomes to topical treatments were presented, with a particular focus on the patients' point of view. Psoriasis is not just a skin condition. Psoriasis can cause negative psychosocial effects, such as depression and anxiety. The risk of suicidality in patients with psoriasis is higher than in the background population. Psychosocial comorbidities can be prevented by patient involvement in psoriasis management and need to be treated in a multidisciplinary manner. Adherence may be the largest barrier to treatment success with topical therapies. Improvement in several areas of disease management may lead to benefits in treatment adherence and hence clinical benefit. There are several treatment-related factors for non-adherence, such as patient dissatisfaction, side effects, treatment regimen or the drug vehicle. Delivering comprehensive treatment information to the patient will help develop realistic objectives and expectations. Patients need to be involved in the selection of treatment strategies, as psoriasis patients have various preferences for their use of topical treatments. A shared decision-making with the patient has been shown to improve medication adherence and treatment success. Prescribing therapy in line with a patient preference for treatment vehicle and improving the communication between healthcare professionals and patients may be key factors to maximize adherence. The calcipotriol (CAL) and betamethasone dipropionate (BDP) cream, a novel formulation of the CAL/BDP fixed-dose combination based on Poly-Aphron Dispersion (PAD) Technology, is a topical treatment of mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis, including scalp psoriasis, that has high cosmetic acceptance and overall treatment satisfaction.",2023,Jan,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,37 Suppl 1,,9-13,,10.1111/jdv.18751,36546463,#1630,Bewley 2023,,,0
Patients' expectations of and experiences with psychosocial care needs in perioperative nursing: a descriptive study.,Ingstad K; Pedersen MK; Uhrenfeldt L; Pedersen PU,"BACKGROUND: Meeting inpatients' psychosocial care needs is essential for their wellbeing, recovery, and positive experiences. This study aimed to describe and compare surgical inpatients' subjective perceptions of the importance of fundamental psychosocial and overall care received. METHODS: A descriptive study with a convenient sample was conducted from September 2019 to April 2020. A total of 194 surgical inpatients from Norway and Denmark answered a perioperative user participation questionnaire on the day of discharge. The questionnaire was previously face- and content validated. The questionnaire assessed patients' sociodemographic characteristics and four dimensions of fundamental care domains: Psychosocial, Relational, Physical, and System level. This study reports the results from the psychosocial domain. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations were used to analyze background information variables. The congruency between participants' expectations of and experiences with psychosocial care is presented. RESULTS: The inpatients expected (and experienced) the healthcare personnel to treat them with respect and dignity, and to be involved and informed throughout their perioperative care. The average ratings regarding these aspects of psychosocial care needs were 72.1-93.8%. There was congruency between patients' perceptions of the subjective importance (SI) of psychosocial fundamental care and their perceived reality (PR) of care. Congruency between high SI and high PR ranged from 59.1 to 92.2%, and congruency between low SI and low PR ranged from 0 to 6.6%. Incongruency between SI and PR varied between 5.9 and 39.6% and was mainly related to higher PR than SI. We found no association between education level, sex, length of stay, age, and patient expectations of or experiences with psychosocial care needs. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical inpatients in Norway and Denmark experience respectful and dignified treatment, and they feel involved and informed in their perioperative care. It is important to include patient perspectives in further research to avoid missed care and disconnection between what patients prefer and what healthcare personnel plan to do. Understanding patient preferences might also lead to less stress and workload for healthcare personnel.",2023,Sep,BMC Nurs,22,1,304,,10.1186/s12912-023-01451-1,37670261,#892,Ingstad 2023,,,0

Physician-led medication reviews in polypharmacy patients treated with at least 12 medications in a type 2 diabetes outpatient clinic: A randomised trial.,Johansson KS; Kornholt J; Bülow C; Petersen TS; Perrild H; Rungby J; Christensen MB,"AIMS: Medication reviews can be used to promote appropriate pharmacotherapy and negate the harmful consequences of polypharmacy. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of physician-led medication reviews and increased cross-sectoral communication as a supplement to standard care in a type 2 diabetes outpatient clinic. METHODS: This pragmatic randomised clinical trial enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes treated with at least 12 medications. The subjects were randomised to either standard care (standard care consultation at the outpatient clinic) or standard care plus a medication review consultation and increased cross-sectoral communication. The primary outcome was the number of medications used after six months. Health-related quality of life was quantified using the EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level (EQ5D-5 L) questionnaire. RESULTS: We recruited 50 participants with a median age of 72 (IQR 67-75) years. The mean number of medications per patient changed from 17.9 to 14.3 in the intervention group and 17.6 to 17.2 in the control group (rate ratio 0.81). The reasons for discontinuations were medication no longer indicated (60%), safety issues (20%), efficacy issues (15%) or patient preferences (5%). There was a significant difference in the change in health-related quality of life (EQ5D-5 L index score) in favour of the intervention (0.111, 95% CI 0.001 to 0.221). CONCLUSIONS: Physician-led medication reviews and increased cross-sectoral communication in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with at least 12 medications reduced the number of medications used and improved health-related quality of life.

Patient Preferences and Perceptions Concerning Aesthetic Providers and Social Media.,Murphrey M; Dayan S; Aguilera SB; Fabi S,"BACKGROUND: With the rise of social media, aesthetic providers have established a presence on social media. However, there has been little research to evaluate how patients perceive these aesthetic providers and what they desire to see on their professional accounts. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the social media preferences and perceptions of patients who undergo aesthetic procedures. METHODS: A survey was sent to a random sample of US individuals; 651 (32%) identified that they underwent aesthetic procedures. Descriptive statistics were utilized to analyze participants and groups were compared with chi-square analyses. RESULTS: Our sample had a majority of females (57% female, 43% male). An aesthetic medical provider's social media presence had a positive impact on 41% of respondents; a minority of respondents (9%) preferred no social media presence. Fifty-five percent of respondents indicated they would prefer to see a provider with a blue checkmark. With regard to content published, 70% of respondents found it important that a provider show before and after photographs. One-third of respondents indicated they would prefer not to see personal content (n = 236, 36%). CONCLUSIONS: A social media presence is not a strict requirement for success, but 41% of respondents reported a social media presence positively impacted their desire to see the provider as a patient. Patients preferred certain characteristics, such as verification and before and after photographs. Aesthetic providers should take care when determining what content to publish to their social accounts and should consider focusing on educational, promotional, and family/interpersonal content.",2023,May,Aesthet Surg J,43,6,704-709,,10.1093/asj/sjad037,36804673,#1239,Murphrey 2023,,,0
A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol to Establish How Common Clinical Acupoint Stimulation-Related Therapies Should Be Used for Managing Insomnia.,Guo P; Xu M; Pan J; Lin J; Hu T; Wei Y; Chen Y; Guo Y,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have now investigated the effects of common clinical acupoint stimulation-related therapies (ASRTs) following the meridian theory of traditional Chinese medicine for the management of insomnia. However, ASRT choice is currently based on personal clinical experience or patient preference. This study will review the common ASRTs reported in clinical trials and analyze their efficacy and safety for managing insomnia with or without co-morbidities. METHODS: English and Chinese databases will be thoroughly searched, and other potentially eligible trials will be obtained by reviewing reference lists of identified studies and previous reviews. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of common clinical ASRTs to manage insomnia published in peer-reviewed journals will be considered. Sleep quality questionnaires or indices will be considered as the main outcome, while the secondary outcomes will include sleep parameters, daytime dysfunction, quality of life, and adverse effects. Two reviewers will independently investigate eligible RCTs, extract information, analyze their methodological quality, and employ Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to evaluate the strength of the evidence. The treatment impact of various ASRTs will be calculated using meta-analysis techniques, and the degree of study heterogeneity will be assessed using Cochrane's Q and I-squared statistics. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be used to evaluate the reliability of the results. RESULTS: Our systematic review and meta-analysis will present up-to-date evidence on: 1) which common clinical ASRTs are beneficial for the management of insomnia; and 2) whether the effects of common clinical ASRTs on insomnia vary depending on clinical, participant, and treatment characteristics. CONCLUSION: The results of our review should help decision-makers make educated choices regarding evidence-based non-pharmacological management options for insomnia.

Attributing practice variation by its sources: the case of varicose veins treatments in the Netherlands.,Schippa L; Gaspar K; van der Hijden E; Koolman X,"BACKGROUND: Unwarranted practice variation refers to regional differences in treatments that are not driven by patients' medical needs or preferences. Although it is the subject of numerous studies, most research focuses on variation at the end stage of treatment, i.e. the stage of the treating specialist, disregarding variation stemming from other sources (e.g. patient preferences, general practitioner referral patterns). In the present paper, we introduce a method that allows us to measure regional variation at different stages of the patient journey leading up to treatment. METHODS: A series of logit regressions estimating the probability of (1) initial visit with the physician and (2) treatment correcting for patient needs and patient preferences. Calculating the coefficient of variation (CVU) at each stage of the patient journey. RESULTS: Our findings show large regional variations in the probability of receiving an initial visit, The CVU, or the measure of dispersion, in the regional probability of an initial visit with a specialist was significantly larger (0.87-0.96) than at the point of treatment both conditional (0.14-0.25) and unconditional on an initial visit (0.65-0.74), suggesting that practice variation was present before the patient reached the specialist. CONCLUSIONS: We present a new approach to attribute practice variation to different stages in the patient journey. We demonstrate our method using the clinically-relevant segment of varicose veins treatments. Our findings demonstrate that irrespective of the gatekeeping role of general practitioners (GPs), a large share of practice variation in the treatment of varicose veins is attributable to regional variation in primary care referrals. Contrary to expectation, specialists' decisions meaningfully diminish rather than increase the amount of regional variation.",2023,Nov,BMC Health Serv Res,23,1,1329,,10.1186/s12913-023-10328-7,38037102,#652,Schippa 2023,,,0

Although results from clinical trials demonstrate that chronological age is a predictor of poor health outcomes, the current management approach remains suboptimal due to insufficient representation of older adults in randomized trials and the inadequate consideration for the interaction between biological aging, concurrent geriatric syndromes, and patient preferences. A shift towards a more patient-centered approach is necessary for appropriately and effectively managing SIHD in the older adult population. In this review, we aim to demonstrate the distinctive needs of older adults who prioritize holistic health outcomes like functional capacity, cognitive abilities, mental health, and quality of life alongside the prevention of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes reported in cardiovascular clinical trials. An individualized, patient-centered approach that involves shared decision-making regarding outcome prioritization is needed when any treatment strategy is being considered. By prioritizing patients and addressing their unique needs for successful aging, we can provide more effective care to a patient population that exhibits the highest cardiovascular risks.",2023,,Front Cardiovasc Med,10,,1276370,,10.3389/fcvm.2023.1276370,38045910,#677,Kalra 2023,,,0

Patient and Public Willingness to Share Personal Health Data for Third-Party or Secondary Uses: Systematic Review.,Baines R; Stevens S; Austin D; Anil K; Bradwell H; Cooper L; Maramba ID; Chatterjee A; Leigh S,"BACKGROUND: International advances in information communication, eHealth, and other digital health technologies have led to significant expansions in the collection and analysis of personal health data. However, following a series of high-profile data sharing scandals and the emergence of COVID-19, critical exploration of public willingness to share personal health data remains limited, particularly for third-party or secondary uses. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to explore factors that affect public willingness to share personal health data for third-party or secondary uses. METHODS: A systematic search of 6 databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and SocINDEX) was conducted with review findings analyzed using inductive-thematic analysis and synthesized using a narrative approach. RESULTS: Of the 13,949 papers identified, 135 were included. Factors most commonly identified as a barrier to data sharing from a public perspective included data privacy, security, and management concerns. Other factors found to influence willingness to share personal health data included the type of data being collected (ie, perceived sensitivity); the type of user requesting their data to be shared, including their perceived motivation, profit prioritization, and ability to directly impact patient care; trust in the data user, as well as in associated processes, often established through individual choice and control over what data are shared with whom, when, and for how long, supported by appropriate models of dynamic consent; the presence of a feedback loop; and clearly articulated benefits or issue relevance including valued incentivization and compensation at both an individual and collective or societal level. CONCLUSIONS: There is general, yet conditional public support for sharing personal health data for third-party or secondary use. Clarity, transparency, and individual control over who has access to what data, when, and for how long are widely regarded as essential prerequisites for public data sharing support. Individual levels of control and choice need to operate within the auspices of assured data privacy and security processes, underpinned by dynamic and responsive models of consent that prioritize individual or collective benefits over and above commercial gain. Failure to understand, design, and refine data sharing approaches in response to changeable patient preferences will only jeopardize the tangible benefits of data sharing practices being fully realized.",2024,Mar,J Med Internet Res,26,,e50421,,10.2196/50421,38441944,#261,Baines 2024,,,0
Use of LetibotulinumtoxinA for Aesthetic Treatment of Asians: A Consensus.,Liu S; Cong L; Pongprutthipan M; Lee W; Luo X; Han X; Li D; Moon HJ; Wang H,"Treatment of wrinkles and dynamic lines with botulinum toxin has been a routine practice for years in aesthetic clinical settings. The effective treatment of wrinkles requires a comprehensive understanding of facial expression muscles and their interactions, the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin, and individual patient preferences. The dose adjustment practice and injection technique of physicians are affected by cultural differences; most Asian patients prefer natural-looking results. This article aims to present an expert consensus on the injection sites, doses, and levels of botulinum toxin for various indications in Asians, with the hope of providing guidance to some clinicians. This consensus paper reviews LetibotulinumtoxinA for patient evaluation, dosage, and delivery techniques in Asians from the time LetibotulinumtoxinA was approved up to December 2022. Panelists proposed individualized treatment plans for botulinum toxin type A (BTxA) treatments in 3 areas-wrinkle removal, contour adjustment, and face lifting-for Asians based on their extensive experience and knowledge of facial anatomy. When using a different BTxA, clinicians should start with a conservative dose and carefully individualize the treatment for each patient, and adjust it according to feedback to obtain a higher satisfaction level.",2023,Oct,Aesthet Surg J,43,11,NP962-NP974,,10.1093/asj/sjad151,37220644,#777,Liu 2023,,,0

The role of Peer Workers in addressing these gaps in a hospital-based context is not well characterized. The aim of this evaluation was to 1) outline the role of Peer Workers in the care of a marginalized populations in the emergency department; 2) characterize the impact of Peer Workers on patient care, and 3) to describe how being employed as a Peer Worker impacts the Peer. METHODS: Through a concurrent mixed methods evaluation, we explore the role of Peer Workers in the care of marginalized populations in the emergency department at two urban hospitals in Toronto, Ontario Canada. We describe the demographic characteristics of patients (n = 555) and the type of supports provided to patients collected through a survey between February and June 2022. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were completed with Peer Workers (n = 7). Interviews were thematically analyzed using a deductive approach, complemented by an inductive approach to allow new themes to emerge from the data. RESULTS: Support provided to patients primarily consisted of friendly conversations (91.4%), discharge planning (59.6%), tactics to help the patient navigate their emotions/mental wellbeing (57.8%) and sharing their lived experience (50.1%). In over one third (38.9%) of all patient interactions, Peer Workers shared new information about the patient with the health care team (e.g., obtaining patient identification). Five major themes emerged from our interviews with Peer Workers which include: (1) Establishing empathy and building trust between the patient and their care team through self-disclosure; (2) Facilitating a person-centered approach to patient care through trauma-informed listening and accessible language; (3) Support for patient preferences on harm reduction; (4) Peer worker role facilitating self-acceptance and self-defined recovery; and (5) Importance of supports and resources to help Peer Workers navigate the emotional intensity of the emergency department.

Defect-Oriented Versus Back Scar-Oriented Flap Design in Breast Reconstruction with Latissimus Dorsi Musculocutaneous Flap: A Patient-Reported Satisfaction Outcome Comparison Using BREAST-Q.,Rha EY; Jeon HH; Park SH; Lee JY,"BACKGROUND: The design of the latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap in breast reconstruction has several options. To date, there have been no reports on the surgical outcomes with flap designed based on the defect shape of the mastectomy site and flap shape of the donor site. To compare patient satisfaction according to the flap design, we designed and conducted independent three sub-studies targeting fifty-three breast reconstruction patients using BREAST-Q(©) scale. METHODS: In study 1, there was no difference in patient satisfaction between the group with the flap designed according to the shape of mastectomy defect (defect-oriented group) that with the flap designed according to patient's wish regardless of defect shape (back scar-oriented group). In study 2, comparing the results based on the shape of the flap, vertically designed flap showed a statistically significant difference in the psychosocial well-being. In study 3, comparing the results based on the shape of the defect, no significant difference was noted. RESULTS: Even though designing a donor flap based on the shape and orientation of the mastectomy defect has no statistical significance in patient satisfaction or quality of life compared with that based on the patient preference in placement of the donor site scar, the group with the vertical donor design showed better psychosocial well-being than the group with other shapes of the donor flap. By considering the advantages and disadvantages of each flap design, enhanced patient satisfaction and durability and natural aesthetic goal can be achieved. This is the first study to compare the differences in results according to the flap design method during breast reconstruction. Patient satisfaction according to the design of the flap was investigated in the form of a questionnaire survey, and the results were displayed. In addition to breast shape, donor scars and complications were also investigated. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

What Do Rheumatology Patients Want in an After-Visit Summary? A Kano Analysis of Patient Preferences.,Kumar B; Zahn C; Seeman L; Levins L; Davis B; Swee M,"BACKGROUND: After-visit summaries (AVS) are patient-specific documents curated by providers to summarize the content of medical encounters. Despite widespread use, little is known about rheumatology patient preferences for AVS content and style. The aims of this quality improvement project are to identify patient preferences and to design a rheumatology-specific AVS, using the Kano method. METHODS: This quality improvement project consists of 4 parts. First, investigators interviewed veterans and clinic staff to derive a list of potential features. Second, a Kano questionnaire assessing satisfaction with the presence or absence of each feature was distributed to veterans. Third, qualitative and quantitative Kano analyses were performed to categorize features as mandatory, performance, attractive, or indifferent. Fourthly, based on these findings, an AVS was drafted and distributed to Veterans with an associated survey to assess satisfaction with content, visual appeal, and readability. RESULTS: Nine physicians, 5 veterans, 5 schedulers, 3 nurses, and 3 medical assistants identified 15 features for inclusion in a Kano-style questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed to 50 Veterans using consecutive sampling. Quantitative Kano analysis demonstrated 4 mandatory, 2 performance, and 3 attractive features that were ultimately included in the AVS; 6 indifferent features were excluded. A postintervention survey of 50 Veterans showed high satisfaction scores in AVS content (4.3/5), visual appeal (4.6/5), and readability (4.4/5). CONCLUSIONS: We developed an AVS that included 9 mandatory, attractive, and performance features, as identified by the Kano method. Veterans were highly satisfied by the content, visual appeal, and readability of the AVS.",2023,Jan,J Clin Rheumatol,29,1,52-57,,10.1097/RHU.0000000000001817,35067509,#1680,Kumar 2023,,,0
Use of the Allium Round Posterior Stent for the Treatment of Recurrent Vesicourethral Anastomosis Stricture.,Cubuk A; Weinberger S; Moldovan ED; Schaeff V; Neymeyer J,"OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes of monopolar incision and Allium Round Posterior Stent (RPS) insertion for the treatment of recurrent vesicourethral anastomosis stricture. METHODS: Having a suprapubic catheter and an obstructed pattern with a peak flow rate (PFR) ≤12 mL/s on uroflowmetry were the indications for the surgery. Once the fibrotic vesicourethral anastomosis was incised, RPS was inserted at the level of vesicourethral anastomosis under fluoroscopic guidance. All the stents were removed at postoperative first year. Patients were evaluated 3months after stent removal. Objective cure was defined as no need to further treatments and PFR ≥12 mL/s while subjective cure was defined as having points <4 on Patient Global Impression of Improvements scale. RESULTS: Of the 30 patients with a median age 66 (52-74) enrolled in the study, 18 had a suprapubic catheter, remaining 12 had median PFR 5.2 (2-10) mL/s. Stent migration was noted in two patients, these stents were replaced by new ones. Stone formation was diagnosed in one patient, a pneumatic-lithotripsy was performed. The median follow-up time was 28 (4-60) months following stent removal. Six cases needed further treatment after removal. The median PFR of remaining 24 patients was 20 (16-30) mL/s (P = .001). The objective cure rate was 24/30(80%), the Patient Global Impression of Improvements scores varied from 1 to 2, meaning subjective cure rate was 24/30(80%). For the six failed cases, according to patient preferences a lifetime RPS insertion was planned. CONCLUSION: With its minimally invasive nature, reversibility, and acceptable success and complication rates, incision of anastomosis and insertion of the RPS for a 1-year duration is a promising option for the treatment of recurrent vesicourethral anastomosis stricture.",2023,Sep,Urology,179,,118-125,,10.1016/j.urology.2023.06.024,37429546,#920,Cubuk 2023,,,0
Hospital doctors' and general practitioners' perspectives of outpatient discharge processes in Australia: an interpretive approach.,Kruys E; Wu CJ,"BACKGROUND: Unnecessary delays in patient discharge from hospital outpatient clinics have direct consequences for timely access of new patients and the length of outpatient waiting times. The aim of this study was to gain better understanding of hospital doctors' and general practitioners' perspectives of the barriers and facilitators when discharging from hospital outpatients to general practice. METHODS: An interpretative approach incorporating semi-structured interviews with 15 participants enabled both hospital doctors and general practitioners to give their perspectives on hospital outpatient discharge processes. RESULTS: Participants mentioned various system problems hampering discharge from hospital outpatient clinics to general practice, such as limitations of electronic communication tools, workforce and workload challenges, the absence of agreed discharge principles, and lack of benchmark data. Hospital clinicians may keep patients under their care out of a concern about lack of follow-up and an inability to escalate timely hospital care following discharge. Some hospital clinicians may have a personal preference to provide ongoing care in the outpatient setting. Other factors mentioned were insufficient supervision of junior doctors, a patient preference to remain under hospital care, and the ease of scheduling follow-up appointments. An effective handover process requires protected time, a systematic approach, and a supportive clinical environment including user-friendly electronic communication and clinical handover tools. Several system improvements and models of care were suggested, such as agreed discharge processes, co-designed between hospitals and general practice. Recording and sharing outpatient discharge data may assist to inform and motivate hospital clinicians and support the training of junior doctors. General practitioners participating in the study were prepared to provide continuation of care but require timely clinical management plans that can be applied in the community setting. A hospital re-entry pathway providing rapid access to outpatient hospital resources after discharge could act as a safety net and may be an alternative to the standard 12-month review in hospital outpatient clinics. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the barriers to discharge as mentioned in the literature and adds the perspectives of both hospital clinicians and general practitioners. Potential solutions were suggested including co-designed discharge policies, improved electronic communication tools and a rapid hospital review pathway following discharge.",2023,Nov,BMC Health Serv Res,23,1,1225,,10.1186/s12913-023-10221-3,37940986,#689,Kruys 2023,,,0

What types of information do pharmacists include in comprehensive medication management review reports? A qualitative content analysis.,Al-Diery T; Freeman H; Page AT; Cross AJ; Hawthorne D; Lee K,"BACKGROUND: Comprehensive medication management reviews are an established intervention to identify medication-related problems, such as the prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications, and under- and over-prescribing. However, the types of information included in written reports of comprehensive medication management reviews, beyond types of medication-related problems, are unknown. AIM: This study aimed to explore the types of information Australian pharmacists include in their written reports following comprehensive medication management reviews. METHOD: Australian consultant pharmacists were invited to upload their 10 most recent written reports of their domiciliary-based comprehensive medication management reviews. A random selection of the reports, stratified by each pharmacist, were included for qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-two de-identified reports from eight consultant pharmacists located in five of the eight Australian States and Territories were included for analysis. From the evaluated reports, four major categories of information were identified: (1) patient details such as date of interview (n = 72, 100%) and medicine history (n = 70, 97%); (2) pharmacist assessment including assessment of the patient (n = 70, 97%), medicines management (n = 68, 94%) and medicine-related issues (n = 60, 83%); (3) pharmacist recommendations, specifically pharmacological recommendations (n = 67, 93%); and (4) patient-centred experiences such as perspectives on medicines (n = 56, 78%). Reporting of patient-centred experiences appeared most variably in the included reports, including patient concerns (n = 38, 53%), willingness for change (n = 27, 38%), patient preferences (n = 13, 18%), and patient goals (n = 7, 10%). CONCLUSION: Pharmacists within our study included a wide variety of information in their comprehensive medication management review reports. Aside from medication-related problems, pharmacists commonly provided a holistic assessment of the patients they care for. However, variability across reports has the potential to impact consistent service delivery.",2023,Jun,Int J Clin Pharm,45,3,712-721,,10.1007/s11096-023-01561-5,36932315,#1203,Al-Diery 2023,,,0
Radiation Therapy Can Be Safely Incorporated into Pretransplantation Treatment Regimens for Patients with Multiple Myeloma.,Damron EP; Qazilbash MH; Fang PQ; Wu SY; Dabaja BS; Rondon G; Hosing C; Champlin RE; Bashir Q; Shpall EJ; Knafl MK; Lee HC; Manasanch EE; Patel K; Thomas SK; Orlowski RZ; Weber DM; Pinnix CC; Gunther JR,"Primary treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) often involves systemic induction therapy (SIT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Radiation therapy (RT) is sometimes used for palliation; however, many practitioners avoid RT out of concern that future peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection required for ASCT may be compromised. In this study, we retrospectively examined the possible effect of RT on PBPC collection. We reviewed the charts of 732 patients with MM treated with RT at our institution from 1999 to 2017, including patients who received RT prior to PBPC collection for planned ASCT. RT plans (both MM and non-MM RT) were reviewed to estimate the percentage of bone marrow (BM) treated using published estimates of skeletal BM distribution. Statistics were performed using Pearson correlation and the t-test. The 732 MM patients included 485 planned for ASCT; of these, 223 received RT prior to PBPC collection and were included in the final cohort. The median age at PBPC collection was 59 years (range, 33 to 80 years). For SIT, patients received combination regimens including the following agents: bortezomib (142 patients; 64%), lenalidomide (111 patients; 50%), and alkylators (46 patients; 21%). Nine patients (4%) received dexamethasone alone. The median cumulative %BM treated per patient was 6.7 (range .0 to 47.4). The median RT dose was 24 Gy (range, 10.0 to 75.6 Gy). Mobilization was performed using granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone (189 patients; 85%), G-CSF with plerixafor (15 patients; 7%), or chemotherapy (19 patients; 9%). A median of 7.8 × 10(6) CD34(+)/kg PBPCs (range, .5 to 54.8× 10(6) CD34(+)/kg) were collected in a median of 3 (range, 1 to 9) apheresis procedures. One hundred ninety-six patients (99%) collected ≥2.0 × 10(6) CD34(+)/kg PBPCs, and 166 (83%) collected >5.0 × 10(6) CD34(+)/kg PBPCs. The number of PBPCs collected was not associated with %BM treated (P = .15) or RT dose (P = .56). The number of apheresis procedures performed was not associated with %BM treated (P = .54) or RT dose (P = .85). The amount of PBPCs collected did not differ significantly between patients receiving RT to the pelvis/sacrum (P = .20) and those receiving RT to the spine (P = .13). The time to platelet engraftment was longer for patients with higher %BM treated (P = .02). Eleven patients did not undergo a confirmed ASCT, owing to patient preference (3 patients), trial therapy (1 patient), comorbidities (1 patient), election for hospice (1 patient), inadequate collection (4 patients), or inadequate follow-up (1 patient). In our study cohort, RT prior to ASCT did not impair successful ASCT. RT must be carefully planned and delivered to ensure safe incorporation into pre-ASCT treatment regimens.",2023,Jan,Transplant Cell Ther,29,1,37.e1-37.e7,,10.1016/j.jtct.2022.10.020,37753818,#1612,Damron 2023,,,0
Evaluating the Feasibility of a Community Pharmacy-Delivered Behaviour Change Intervention to Reduce Reliever Reliance in Asthma.,Foot H; Beyene K; Horne R; Fingleton J; Harrison J; Chan AHY,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a community pharmacy-delivered intervention to shift patients' beliefs about short-acting beta(2) agonists (SABA) in asthma management. The study targeted individual beliefs about SABA and assessed actual SABA use, focusing on reducing SABA use as well as adherence to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as a preventive measure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This non-randomized, before-and-after feasibility study enrolled participants with asthma from four community pharmacies in Auckland, New Zealand. Eligible participants were aged 18 years and above and were prescribed a SABA for their asthma. The intervention included the SABA reliance questionnaire to determine the degree of SABA reliance, verbal discussions with pharmacists personalised according to the degree of SABA reliance identified, and referral to general practitioners as appropriate. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients who consented into the study, 19 were in the control group and 16 in the intervention group. Recruitment and retention were modest, with 10 control and five intervention participants completing the 90-day follow-up. Although not statistically significant, preliminary results indicated reduced SABA reliance and increased ICS adherence in the intervention group, and reduced SABA refill. Feedback showed that 78% of intervention participants found the information easy to understand, and 56% expressed intent to consult their general practitioners. Pharmacy staff found the intervention feasible but noted time constraints as a barrier to intervention delivery. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that a community pharmacy-delivered intervention is feasible and acceptable to both patients and pharmacists. While preliminary results show a positive effect on reducing SABA reliance and improvement of ICS adherence, the results were not statistically significant due to the small numbers recruited. This suggests a larger randomised trial is indicated. This intervention holds promise for addressing the over-reliance on SABA in asthma management and improving adherence to preventive therapies.",2024,,Patient Prefer Adherence,18,,361-371,,10.2147/PPA.S445763,38344153,#383,Foot 2024,,,0
Evolving therapeutic landscape of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: challenges and aspirations.,Chan JY; Somasundaram N; Grigoropoulos N; Lim F; Poon ML; Jeyasekharan A; Yeoh KW; Tan D; Lenz G; Ong CK; Lim ST,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the commonest subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and encompasses a group of diverse disease entities, each harboring unique molecular and clinico-pathological features. The understanding of the molecular landscape of DLBCL has improved significantly over the past decade, highlighting unique genomic subtypes with implications on targeted therapy. At the same time, several new treatment modalities have been recently approved both in the frontline and relapsed settings, ending a dearth of negative clinical trials that plagued the past decade. Despite that, in the real-world setting, issues like drug accessibility, reimbursement policies, physician and patient preference, as well as questions regarding optimal sequencing of treatment options present difficulties and challenges in day-to-day oncology practice.

Study within a trial of electronic versus paper-based Patient-Reported oUtcomes CollEction (SPRUCE): study protocol for a partially randomised patient preference study.,Philipps L; Foster S; Gardiner D; Gath J; Gillman A; Haviland J; Hill E; King D; Manning G; Stiles M; Hall E; Lewis R,"INTRODUCTION: Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) are currently collected from trial participants using paper questionnaires by the Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR-CTSU). Streamlining PRO collection using electronic questionnaires (ePRO) may improve data collection and patient experience. Here, we outline our protocol for a Study within a trial of electronic versus paper-based Patient-Reported oUtcomes CollEction (SPRUCE), which investigates the acceptability of ePRO in oncology clinical trials. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: SPRUCE was developed alongside patient and public contributors. SPRUCE runs in multiple host trials with a partially randomised patient preference design, allowing participants to be randomised or choose their preference of electronic or paper questionnaires. Questionnaires are scheduled in accordance with host trial follow-up. The primary objective will assess differences in return rates (compliance) between ePRO and paper PROs at the first timepoint post-host trial intervention in the randomised group. Paper PRO compliance is expected to be 90%. 244 randomised participants are required to exclude ≤80% compliance rates with ePRO (10% non-inferiority margin, with 80% power and one-sided alpha=0.05). SPRUCE aims to assess acceptability of ePRO in oncology clinical trials, establish whether ePRO is acceptable to ICR-CTSU trial participants and can capture complete PRO data, consistent with paper PROs. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The SPRUCE protocol (ICR-CTSU/2021/10074) was approved by the Coventry and Warwick Central Research Ethics Committee (21/WM/0223) on 21 October 2021. Results will be disseminated via presentations, publications and lay summaries. No participant identifiable data will be included.

Do Orthopaedic Virtual Clinic Visits Demonstrate Cost and Time Efficiencies Compared With In-person Visits?,Livingston N; Lindahl A; McConnell J; Chouman A; Day CS,"BACKGROUND: There are numerous reasons for the increased use of telemedicine in orthopaedic surgery, one of which is the perception that virtual visits are more cost-effective than in-person visits. However, to our knowledge, no studies have compared the cost and time investment of virtual versus in-person visits using the time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) method. Unlike methods that estimate cost based on charges for services rendered, TDABC provides a more precise measurement of costs, which is essential for assessing cost-effective innovations and moving to value-based healthcare. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Are virtual visits less costly than analogous in-person visits, as measured by TDABC? (2) Does TDABC yield cost estimates that are lower or higher than the ratio of costs to charges (RCC), which is a simple, frequently used costing method? (3) Do the total time commitments of healthcare personnel, and that of the surgeon specifically, vary between the virtual and in-person settings? METHODS: Patients for this prospective, observational study were recruited from the practices of the highest-volume virtual-visit surgeons of three subspecialties (joints, hand, and sports) in a multihospital, tertiary-care academic institution in a metropolitan area in the Midwestern United States. Each surgeon had at least 10 years of clinical practice. Between June 2021 and September 2021, we analyzed both in-person and virtual return visits with patients who had an established relationship with the surgeon, because this represented the most frequent type of virtual visits and enabled a direct comparison between the two settings. New patients were not included in the study because of the limited availability of new-patient virtual visits; such patients often benefit from in-person physical examinations and on-site imaging. Additionally, patients seen for routine postoperative care were excluded because they were primarily seen in person by a physician assistant. Data were acquired during this period until 90 in-person and 90 virtual visits were collected according to selection criteria; no patients were lost to follow-up. Distinct process maps, which represent the steps involved in a clinic visit used to measure healthcare personnel time invested, were constructed for in-person and virtual clinic visits and used to compare total personnel and surgeon time spent. To calculate TDABC-derived costs, time allocated by personnel to complete each step was measured and used to calculate cost based on each personnel member's yearly salary. From the accounting department of our hospital, we acquired RCC cost data according to the level of service for a return visit. RESULTS: The total median cost, as measured by TDABC, was USD 127 (IQR USD 111 to 163) for an in-person visit and USD 140 (IQR USD 113 to 205) for a virtual visit (median difference USD 13; p = 0.16). RCC overestimated TDABC-calculated direct variable cost in five of six service levels (in-person levels 3, 4, and 5 and virtual levels 3 and 5) by a range of USD 25 to 88. Additionally, we found that virtual visits consumed 4 minutes less of total personnel time (in-person: 17 minutes [IQR 13.5 to 23.5 minutes], virtual: 13 minutes [IQR 11 to 19 minutes]; p < 0.001); however, this difference in personnel time did not equate to cost savings because surgeons spent 2 minutes longer on virtual visit activities than they did on in-person activities (in-person: 6 minutes [IQR 4.5 to 9.5 minutes], virtual: 8 minutes [IQR 5.5 to 13 minutes]; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic virtual visits did not deliver cost savings compared with in-person visits because surgeons spent more time on virtual visits and participated in virtual visits at the clinical site. Additionally, as anticipated, RCC overestimated costs as calculated by TDABC. These findings suggest that cost is not a primary advantage of transitioning to virtual visits, and that factors such as patient preference and satisfaction should be considered instead.

Polygenic Risk Prediction in Diverticulitis.,De Roo AC; Chen Y; Du X; Handelman S; Byrnes M; Regenbogen SE; Speliotes EK; Maguire LH,"OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate a polygenic risk score (PRS) to predict the occurrence and severity of diverticulitis and to understand the potential for incorporation of a PRS in current decision-making. BACKGROUND: PRS quantifies genetic variation into a continuous measure of risk. There is a need for improved risk stratification to guide surgical decision-making that could be fulfilled by PRS. It is unknown how surgeons might integrate PRS in decision-making. METHODS: We derived a PRS with 44 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with diverticular disease in the UK Biobank and validated this score in the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI). We performed a discrete choice experiment of practicing colorectal surgeons. Surgeons rated the influence of clinical factors and a hypothetical polygenic risk prediction tool. RESULTS: Among 2812 MGI participants with diverticular disease, 1964 were asymptomatic, 574 had mild disease, and 274 had severe disease. PRS was associated with occurrence and severity. Patients in the highest PRS decile were more likely to have diverticulitis [odds ratio (OR)=1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.42-2.38)] and more likely to have severe diverticulitis (OR=1.61; 95% CI, 1.04-2.51) than the bottom 50%. Among 213 surveyed surgeons, extreme disease-specific factors had the largest utility (3 episodes in the last year, +74.4; percutaneous drain, + 69.4). Factors with strongest influence against surgery included 1 lifetime episode (-63.3), outpatient management (-54.9), and patient preference (-39.6). PRS was predicted to have high utility (+71). CONCLUSIONS: A PRS derived from a large national biobank was externally validated, and found to be associated with the incidence and severity of diverticulitis. Surgeons have clear guidance at clinical extremes, but demonstrate equipoise in intermediate scenarios. Surgeons are receptive to PRS, which may be most useful in marginal clinical situations. Given the current lack of accurate prognostication in recurrent diverticulitis, PRS may provide a novel approach for improving patient counseling and decision-making.",2023,Jun,Ann Surg,277,6,e1262-e1268,,10.1097/SLA.0000000000005623,35876359,#1220,DeRoo 2023,,,0
Survival and long-term quality-of-life of concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus surgery followed by radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy for the treatment of resectable stage III/IV hypopharyngeal carcinoma.,Huang Z; Zhang X; Zhang Y; Cai H; Wang S; Zhuge L; An C; Li Z,"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the utility of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) compared to surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (with or without concurrent chemotherapy) (SRT) in terms of improving the life expectancy and quality-of-life (QOL) of patients with stage III/IV hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (HPSCCs). METHODS: From January 2010 to July 2018, a total of 299 patients with stage III/IV HPSCC who received surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (with or without concurrent chemotherapy) (SRT, n = 111), or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT, n = 188) in our hospital were included. We measured overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). We used the EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-H&N35, and Voice handicap index-30 (VHI-30) instruments to assess the long-term QOL. RESULTS: The OS and DFS afforded by SRT were significantly better than those associated with CCRT (p = 0.039; p = 0.048 respectively), especially for stage N2-N3 patients. CCRT patients experienced better speech outcomes. CONCLUSION: For resectable stage III/IV HPSCC patients, appropriate treatment plans should be selected comprehensively considering survival rate, QOL, patient preference and multidisciplinary treatment.",2023,Sep,Asian J Surg,46,9,3693-3699,,10.1016/j.asjsur.2022.12.155,36624003,#955,Huang 2023,,,0
Telephone versus video consultations: A systematic review of comparative effectiveness studies and guidance for choosing the most appropriate modality.,Caffery LJ; Catapan SC; Taylor ML; Kelly JT; Haydon HM; Smith AC; Snoswell CL,"OBJECTIVE: This systematic review compared clinical, service and cost effectiveness of telephone consultations (TC) to video consultations (VC). METHODS: We searched Embase, CINAHL and MEDLINE for empirical studies that compared TC to VC using clinical, service or economic outcome measures. Clinician or patient preference and satisfaction studies were excluded. Findings were synthesised descriptively. RESULTS: A total of 79 articles were included. The most effective modality was found to be VC in 40 studies (50%) and TC in 3 (4%). VC and TC were found to be equivalent in 28 of the included articles (35%). VC were superior or equivalent to TC for all clinical outcomes. When compared to TC, VC were likely to have better patient engagement and retention, to improve transfer decisions, and reduce downstream sub-acute care utilisation. The impact of telehealth modality on consultation time, completion rates, failure-to-attend rates and acute care utilisation was mixed. VC were consistently found to be more cost effective despite having a higher incremental cost than TC. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review demonstrates equal or better, but not inferior clinical and cost outcomes for consultations delivered by VC when compared to TC. VC appear to be more clinically effective when visual information is required, when verbal communication with the patient is impaired and when patient engagement and retention is linked to clinical outcomes. We have provided conditions where VC should be used in preference to TC. These can be used by clinicians to guide the choice of telehealth modality. Cost effectiveness is also important to consider when choosing modality.",2024,Feb,J Telemed Telecare,,,1357633X241232464,,10.1177/1357633X241232464,38419502,#330,Caffery 2024,,,0
How Do We Manage Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in India.,Karunakaran P; Jain N; Lad DP,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was an ignored leukemia in India until a decade back, given its low prevalence and absence of novel drugs to treat it. Healthcare in India is heterogeneous, with variations in population, health systems, and reimbursement options. We have focused on opinions from three hemato-oncologists incorporating an opinion poll from 44 hemato-oncologists across India on the common issues in CLL to give an idea of the practice pan-India. RECENT FINDINGS: More CLL patients are being diagnosed in their early stages. There is an attempt to use prognostic and predictive markers in making shared decisions for managing CLL. There is still a role for chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) in India, given limited health insurance coverage. But with the availability of inexpensive generics, the patient preference for non-CIT options like Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors is palpable. The CLL scene in India is changing rapidly. With the wide availability of economical generic small molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and coverage by social health insurance schemes, India is poised to cater to most CLL patient needs.",2024,Apr,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,19,2,56-64,,10.1007/s11899-023-00722-7,38300458,#190,Karunakaran 2024,,,0
Angiosarcoma of the breast: A review.,An R; Men XJ; Ni XH; Wang WT; Wang CL,"Breast angiosarcoma is a rare and highly aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. It can occur spontaneously or be associated with factors such as radiation therapy or chronic lymphedema. The etiology and pathogenesis of this disease are still unclear, the clinical symptoms and imaging findings lack specificity, and the pathological morphology is diverse, which is easy to be confused with other diseases. There is no clear guideline for surgical treatment. Although the optimal surgical approach remains unclear, the ultimate goal is surgical excision with optimal margins, which remains the primary method of treatment. In clinical practice, the choice of the surgical approach should be made by considering the tumor size, pathological type, and patient preferences. In clinical practice, the selection of surgical methods should be carried out with comprehensive consideration of tumor size, pathological types and patients' wishes. There is no clear consensus on whether radiotherapy and chemotherapy should be carried out after surgery, and its optimal program and efficacy are uncertain. This article reviews the etiology, clinical manifestations, pathological features, imaging findings, treatment, prognosis and other aspects of breast angiosarcoma, so as to strengthen clinicians' overall understanding of this disease and avoid missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis.",2024,Feb,Heliyon,10,3,e24413,,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e24413,38318005,#367,An 2024,,,0
Direct-to-consumer orthodontics: Exploring laypeople's perception of orthodontic treatment complexity.,Tabbaa S; Nguyen T; Toubouti Y; Saltaji H,"BACKGROUND: The authors aimed to explore the treatment preferences of laypeople regarding direct-to-consumer (DTC) orthodontics and to identify whether case complexity, as perceived by laypeople, is one of the factors influencing interest in DTC orthodontics. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted. Data analysis was performed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 1,362 surveys were completed. A significant inverse association was identified between the complexity of an orthodontic case, as measured using the American Board of Orthodontics' discrepancy index (DI) score, and the likelihood of choosing DTC treatment over an orthodontist. Participants were 3.53 times more likely to choose DTC treatment for a mild case (DI score, 0-10) compared with a complex case (DI score, > 20), although the likelihood of choosing DTC treatment for a moderate case (DI score, 11-20) was only 1.79 times higher than for a complex case. CONCLUSIONS: When laypeople were asked to consider each case as if it were their own dentition, there was a significant inverse association between the complexity of an orthodontic case, as measured using the DI score, and the likelihood of choosing DTC treatment over an orthodontist. Laypeople were seemingly more likely to choose DTC orthodontics for dentitions that did not appear crowded and were well aligned within the arches. Laypeople seemed to have an understanding that there are some limitations to DTC orthodontics. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Orthodontists should better understand the factors influencing consumers' decisions to select DTC orthodontics and dental organizations should focus their educational campaigns on these factors.",2023,Feb,J Am Dent Assoc,154,2,130-140.e2,,10.1016/j.adaj.2022.10.017,36593134,#1543,Tabbaa 2023,,,0
Impact of Telemedicine Modality on Quality Metrics in Diverse Settings: Implementation Science-Informed Retrospective Cohort Study.,Rome D; Sales A; Cornelius T; Malhotra S; Singer J; Ye S; Moise N,"BACKGROUND: Video-based telemedicine (vs audio only) is less frequently used in diverse, low socioeconomic status settings. Few prior studies have evaluated the impact of telemedicine modality (ie, video vs audio-only visits) on clinical quality metrics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess telemedicine uptake and impact of visit modality (in-person vs video and phone visits) on primary care quality metrics in diverse, low socioeconomic status settings through an implementation science lens. METHODS: Informed by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework, we evaluated telemedicine uptake, assessed targeted primary care quality metrics by visit modality, and described provider-level qualitative feedback on barriers and facilitators to telemedicine implementation. RESULTS: We found marginally better quality metrics (ie, blood pressure and depression screening) for in-person care versus video and phone visits; de-adoption of telemedicine was marked within 2 years in our population. CONCLUSIONS: Following the widespread implementation of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of visit modality on quality outcomes, provider and patient preferences, as well as technological barriers in historically marginalized settings should be considered.",2023,Jul,J Med Internet Res,25,,e47670,,10.2196/47670,37494087,#1044,Rome 2023,,,0
Patient's Perspective on Psychiatric Drugs: A Multicenter Survey-Based Study.,Han S; Kim SY; Jung YE; Kim W; Seo JS; Sohn I; Lee K; Lee JH; Chung SK; Lee SY; Hong JW; Yoon BH; Woo YS; Han C; Chang JG; Bahk WM; Song HR; Hong M,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the expectations and preferences for medication and medical decision-making in patients with major psychiatric disorders. METHODS: A survey was conducted among patients with major psychiatric disorders who visited psychiatric outpatient clinics at 15 hospitals between 2016 and 2018 in Korea. The survey consisted of 12 questions about demographic variables and opinions on their expectations for medication, important medical decision-makers, and preferred drug type. The most preferred value in each category in the total population was identified, and differences in the preference ratio of each item among the disease groups were compared. RESULTS: A total of 707 participants were surveyed. In the total population, patients reported high efficacy (44.01%±21.44%) as the main wish for medication, themselves (37.39%±22.57%) and a doctor (35.27%±22.88%) as the main decision makers, and tablet/capsule (36.16%±30.69%) as the preferred type of drug. In the depressive disorders group, the preference ratio of high efficacy was significantly lower, and the preference ratio of a small amount was significantly higher than that of the psychotic disorder and bipolar disorder groups. The preference ratio of a doctor as an important decision maker in the bipolar disorder group was higher compared to the other groups. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the preference for medications and showed differences among patients with psychiatric disorders.

Rate and reasons for peritoneal dialysis dropout following haemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis switch: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Sun X; McKeaveney C; Shields J; Chan CP; Henderson M; Fitzell F; Noble H; O'Neill S,"BACKGROUND: Patient experiences and survival outcomes can be influenced by the circumstances related to dialysis initiation and subsequent modality choices. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the rate and reasons for peritoneal dialysis (PD) dropout following haemodialysis (HD) to PD switch. METHOD: This systematic review conducted searches in four databases, including Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (study ID: CRD42023405718). Outcomes included factors leading to the switch from HD to PD, the rate and reasons for PD dropout and mortality difference in two groups (PD first group versus HD to PD group). The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist and the GRADE tool were used to assess quality. RESULTS: 4971 papers were detected, and 13 studies were included. On meta-analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in PD dropout in the PD first group (OR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.61, 1.09; I(2) = 83%; P = 0.16), however, there was a statistically significant reduction in the rate of mortality (OR: 0.48; 95%CI: 0.25, 0.92; I2 = 73%; P = 0.03) compared to the HD to PD group. The primary reasons for HD to PD switch, included vascular access failure, patient preference, social issues, and cardiovascular disease. Causes for PD dropout differed between the two groups, but inadequate dialysis and peritonitis were the main reasons for PD dropout in both groups. CONCLUSION: Compared to the PD first group, a previous HD history may not impact PD dropout rates for patients, but it could impact mortality in the HD to PD group. The reasons for PD dropout differed between the two groups, with no statistical differences. Psychosocial reasons for PD dropout are valuable to further research. Additionally, establishing a consensus on the definition of PD dropout is crucial for future studies.",2024,Mar,BMC Nephrol,25,1,99,,10.1186/s12882-024-03542-w,38493084,#232,Sun 2024,,,0
Physical therapists' perspectives of patient values and their place in clinical practice: a qualitative study.,Bastemeijer CM; van Ewijk JP; Hazelzet JA; Voogt LP,"BACKGROUND: In physical therapy practice patients and therapists exchange their perspectives on musculoskeletal health problems and their meaning for both of them. However, literature indicates that physical therapists find it difficult to enquire about the patients' values during clinical encounters. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to gain deeper insight into the perspectives of physical therapists about patient values. DESIGN: Explorative qualitative focus group study. METHOD: Twenty-three physical therapists were interviewed in the Netherlands from March to May 2021. Two researchers analyzed the interviews and derived relevant codes. After an iterative process of comparing, analyzing, conceptualizing and discussing the codes, themes were identified through a thematic framework, illustrated with meaningful quotes. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified: Humane, Tacit, and Responsive. It appeared that patient values play unconsciously a major role in daily practice and are associated with humanity, not technical or procedural aspects of the encounter. Responsive denotes that all values require interaction in which aligning with the individual patient forms the basis of treatment. Barriers for being responsive are identified as subthemes: Choices, Trust, Diverseness, and Boundaries. CONCLUSION: The concept of patient values appeared to be implicit. The professional intuitively attunes as a fellow human being to values and expectations of the individual patient. This study contributes to finding a balance and mutual reinforcement of implicit and explicit knowledge. With all found experiences and insights the concept of patient values became more explicit in physical therapy to create a framework for education and research in the future.",2023,Sep-Oct,Braz J Phys Ther,27,5,100552,,10.1016/j.bjpt.2023.100552,37862915,#894,Bastemeijer 2023,,,0
Correlation of an Electronic Geriatric Assessment With Receipt of Adjuvant Radiation and Chemotherapy in Older Adults With Head and Neck Cancer.,Restifo D; Raab G; McBride SM; Pfister DG; Wong RJ; Lee NY; Shahrokni A; Zakeri K,"PURPOSE: Treatment patterns for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) vary among older adults because of concerns about their health status. Geriatric assessment may guide treatment for older adults with HNSCC by assessing their health status. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted a retrospective review of adjuvant treatment received by older patients with HNSCC who completed a novel geriatric assessment, the electronic Rapid Fitness Assessment, before treatment. The electronic Rapid Fitness Assessment yields an accumulated geriatric deficits (AGD) score. Higher AGD score indicates greater frailty. Comparators were age and performance status. The Wilcoxon rank sum test compared differences between those who did and did not receive adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy. RESULTS: The cohort included 73 patients, of whom 56 (77%) had oral cavity cancer. The most common geriatric deficits were major distress, social activity limitation, depression, and impaired activities of daily living. AGD score, age, and performance status were not associated with receipt of adjuvant radiation. Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy had a significantly lower median AGD score than those who did not (3 vs 6; P = .044), but there was no association with age and performance status. Of the 17 patients with newly diagnosed disease and either positive margins or extranodal extension, only 9 received adjuvant radiation and only 3 received systemic therapy. Most often, systemic therapy was omitted because of patient preference or comorbidities and poor performance status. There was a nonstatistically significant lower AGD score between patients who did and did not receive standard fractionated radiation therapy (median, 4 vs 6.5; P = .13). CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with frailty. Rates of chemotherapy utilization were very low, indicating the need for novel strategies to mitigate the toxicity burden in this patient population. Receipt of adjuvant radiation therapy was not associated with frailty; however, there was a trend toward lower frailty among those who did receive radiation therapy.",2023,Jan-Feb,Adv Radiat Oncol,8,1,101096,,10.1016/j.adro.2022.101096,36483055,#1635,Restifo 2023,,,0
Disparities in health utilities among hepatitis C patients receiving care in different settings.,Saeed YA; Mason K; Mitsakakis N; Feld JJ; Bremner KE; Phoon A; Fried A; Wong JF; Powis J; Krahn MD; Wong WW,"BACKGROUND: Although chronic hepatitis C (CHC) disproportionately affects marginalized individuals, most health utility studies are conducted in hospital settings which are difficult for marginalized patients to access. We compared health utilities in CHC patients receiving care at hospital-based clinics and socio-economically marginalized CHC patients receiving care through a community-based program. METHODS: We recruited CHC patients from hospital-based clinics at the University Health Network and community-based sites of the Toronto Community Hep C Program, which provides treatment, support, and education to patients who have difficulty accessing mainstream health care. We elicited utilities using six standardized instruments (EuroQol-5D-3L [EQ-5D], Health Utilities Index Mark 2/Mark 3 [HUI2/HUI3], Short Form-6D [SF-6D], time trade-off [TTO], and Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to examine factors associated with differences in health utility. RESULTS: Compared with patients recruited from the hospital setting (n = 190), patients recruited from the community setting (n = 101) had higher unemployment (87% versus 67%), history of injection drug use (88% versus 42%), and history of mental health issue(s) (79% versus 46%). Unadjusted health utilities were lower in community than hospital patients (e.g., EQ-5D: 0.722 [SD 0.209] versus 0.806 [SD 0.195]). Unemployment and a history of mental health issue(s) were significant predictors of low health utility. CONCLUSIONS: Socio-economically marginalized CHC patients have lower health utilities than patients typically represented in the CHC utility literature. Their utilities should be incorporated into future cost-utility analyses to better represent the population living with CHC in health policy decisions.",2023,Feb,Can Liver J,6,1,24-38,,10.3138/canlivj-2022-0009,36908577,#1499,Saeed 2023,,,1
Do preferences differ based on respondent experience of a health issue and its treatment? A case study using a public health intervention.,Mott DJ; Ternent L; Vale L,"OBJECTIVES: Preference information is increasingly being elicited to support decision-making. Although discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are commonly used, little is known about how respondents' relative experience of a health issue, and its treatment, might impact the results of preference studies. The aim of this study was to explore how preferences differ between groups of individuals with varying levels of experience of a health issue and its treatment, using a weight loss maintenance (WLM) programme as a case study. METHODS: An online DCE survey was provided to four groups, each differing in their level of experience with weight loss and WLM programmes. One group was recruited from a randomised controlled trial of a WLM programme (ISRCTN14657176) and the other three from an online panel. Choice data were analysed using mixed logit models. Relative attribute importance scores and willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates were estimated to enable comparisons between groups. RESULTS: Preferences differed between the groups across different attributes. The largest differences related to the outcome (weight re-gain) and cost attributes, resulting in WTP estimates that were statistically significantly different. The most experienced group was willing to pay £0.35 (95% CI: £0.28, £0.42) to avoid a percentage point increase in weight re-gain, compared with £0.12 (95% CI: £0.08, £0.16) for the least experienced group. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence in a public health setting to suggest that preferences differ based on respondent experience of the health issue and its treatment. Health preference researchers should therefore carefully consider the appropriate composition of their study samples.",2023,Apr,Eur J Health Econ,24,3,413-423,,10.1007/s10198-022-01482-6,35716317,#1384,Mott 2023,,,1
Patient Decision Making in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Discrete Choice Experiment Examining Graft Preference.,Sonnier JH; Paul RW; Sando HE; Hall AT; Tjoumakaris FP; Cohen SB; Freedman KB,"BACKGROUND: Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) and hamstring autografts are the most common grafts used for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Patient preferences should be accounted for as a part of shared decision making. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to perform a discrete choice experiment that evaluated patient preferences toward ACL autografts. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in patient preferences between groups. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Patients aged 18 to 25 years who underwent shoulder arthroscopy at a single institution between 2013 and 2019 were included in the study as a proxy for healthy controls. Patients with a history of ACL tear were excluded. A discrete choice experiment was developed from a literature search and used the following data points as they pertain to BTB or hamstring autograft: risk of developing a significant complication, return-to-play rate, risk of anterior knee pain with kneeling, and risk of additional surgery due to graft failure. Included patients completed a custom survey in which they were asked to choose between ""surgery A"" (hamstring) and ""surgery B"" (BTB). RESULTS: A total of 107 participants were included in the analysis. Of these participants, 39 (36.5%) chose surgery A (hamstring) and 68 (63.6%) chose surgery B (BTB). When comparing the hamstring group with the BTB group, there was no significant difference in age, sex, body mass index, race, level of education, or employment status. However, 80.5% of self-reported athletes preferred BTB (P = .008). When controlling for age, sex, and body mass index, patients in the BTB group were more likely to rate return to sport (risk ratio [RR] = 1.49 [95% CI, 1.18-1.98]; P = .001) and the risk of requiring additional surgery due to graft failure (RR = 1.26 [95% CI, 1.02-1.58]; P = .037) as highly important. Conversely, they were less likely than patients in the hamstring group to rate pain while kneeling (RR = 0.65 [95% CI, 0.98-1.05]; P < .001) and complication risk (RR = 0.75 [95% CI, 0.59-0.94]; P = .013) as important. CONCLUSION: The study hypothesis was rejected, as patient values did affect ACL graft choice preference.

Effect of Utilizing Cheek Retractors on Patient Satisfaction and Trueness of Peripheral Borders in Maxillary Digital Scans for Totally Edentulous Patients: An In Vivo Study.,Saadeh C; Tohme H; Lawand G; Khoury N; Yared C,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of cheek retractors on the accuracy of capturing peripheral borders in totally edentulous digital scans by comparing the conventional impression technique to digital scans made using two different cheek retractors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen edentulous maxillary impressions were made using three techniques: the conventional impression technique, using modeling thermoplastic compound and zinc oxide eugenol paste; the digital intraoral scanning technique using the DIO scan retractor (DIO); and using the Br.nemark lip retractor (BRAN). The control impressions of each patient were poured, scanned using a desktop scanner, then transferred into a three-dimensional analysis software. DIO and BRAN groups were scanned using an intraoral scanner, imported, and superimposed using best fit algorithm on the corresponding control. The root mean square for the whole surface and for particular interest regions were calculated to assess the degree of trueness. The patients' perceptions of the impression techniques were the secondary outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using the one sample T-test and Wilcoxon test (α=.05). RESULTS: Significant discrepancies were found for BRAN and DIO compared to the control. No significant discrepancies were found when comparing RMS of BRAN and DIO at different regions. Scan retractors had a significant impact on patient satisfaction, with patients preferring DIO. CONCLUSIONS: Edentulous intraoral scans made using cheek retractors had similar deviations when compared to each other but diverged from the conventional impression in edentulous maxilla. Patient preferences for intraoral scans over conventional impressions were confirmed. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The use of different retracting methods during intraoral scanning of totally edentulous maxillary arches does not affect the peripheral border registration.",2024,Mar,Int J Prosthodont,0,0,1-23,,10.11607/ijp.8895,38536145,#213,Saadeh 2024,,,0
Effectiveness of patient decision aid supported shared decision-making intervention in in-person and virtual hybrid pulmonary rehabilitation in older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A pilot randomized controlled trial.,Jiang Y; Nuerdawulieti B; Chen Z; Guo J; Sun P; Chen M; Li J,"INTRODUCTION: Tele-pulmonary rehabilitation is increasingly advocated but cannot completely substitute for in-person services for chronic conditions. Adherence to Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) remains low in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Shared decision-making (SDM) promotes patients' participation in PR decisions and helps patients and healthcare providers to jointly make decisions that patients are informed and aligned with patient preferences and values, which are critical for patient adherence to PR. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a hybrid in-person and virtual model of home-based PR services for older COPD patients and study the effectiveness of the patient decision aid (PDA)-supported recurring SDM intervention on patient adherence to PR, rehabilitation outcomes, and decision-related outcomes, as well as to explore the mechanisms of the intervention on PR adherence. METHODS: A total of 78 older COPD patients were randomly assigned to the PR group (n = 39) or PDA-PR group (n = 39). Both groups were conducted hybrid in-person and virtual PR intervention for 3 months. The primary outcomes were patients' quality of life and PR adherence. The secondary outcomes were dyspnea symptoms, exercise self-efficacy, knowledge, and decision-related outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 72 participants completed the 3-month PR program. There were statistically significant differences in PR adherence (p = 0.033), COPD assessment test (CAT) scores (p = 0.016), PR knowledge (p < 0.001), decision self-efficacy (p < 0.001), decision conflict (p < 0.001), and decision regret scores (p = 0.027) between the two groups. The modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea scale (mMRC) score was significantly decreased only in PDA-PR group (p = 0.011). No statistically significant differences were observed in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score (p = 0.078), Exercise Self-Regulatory Efficacy Scale (Ex-SRES) score (p = 0.29) and COPD knowledge (p = 0.086) between the two groups. PR value score had a significant effect on adherence to PR (p = 0.007) and CAT score (p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: PDA supported recurring SDM intervention was helpful in maintaining older COPD patients' PR adherence and had advantages in improving quality of life, enhancing PR knowledge, decision self-efficacy, and reducing decision conflict and decision regret, but did not improve SGRQ and Ex-SRES. PR value score influenced patients' rehabilitation adherence and quality of life.

Patient motivation and preferences in changing co-occurring health risk behaviors in general hospital patients.,Spielmann M; Krolo-Wicovsky F; Tiede A; Krause K; Baumann S; Siewert-Markus U; John U; Freyer-Adam J,"OBJECTIVES: More than 60% of general hospital patients report ≥ 2 health risk behaviors (HRBs), i.e. tobacco smoking, at-risk alcohol use, unhealthy diet, and/or insufficient physical activity. This study investigates a) the association between numbers of HRBs and motivation to change, b) patient preferences for receiving feedback on HRBs, and c) patients' expected gain in quality of life if behavior change made. METHODS: In 2020/2021, 256 18-64-year-old general hospital patients (72.1% of eligibles) reported on their motivation to change each of their HRBs. Associations between HRB number and motivation were assessed using multivariate linear regressions. Participants ranked HRBs concerning their interest in receiving feedback and concerning their expected gain in quality of life if behavior change occurred. RESULTS: Higher HRB number was negatively related to motivation among at-risk alcohol users (p = 0.034); 24.6% expected gain in their quality of life from behavior change. Participants overall appeared more favorable to feedback about vegetable/fruit intake and physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Unhealthier lifestyle may be accompanied by decreased motivation to change in at-risk alcohol users. In case of co-occurring HRBs, asking patients for expected gain in quality of life may help guiding intervention target.

"Hereditary colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer: comprehensive review.",Seppälä TT; Burkhart RA; Katona BW,"BACKGROUND: Inheritance patterns show familial clustering of gastrointestinal cancers, and multiple germline conditions have now been identified that predispose to colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancers. METHODS: A narrative review based on recent relevant literature was conducted. RESULTS: Lynch syndrome, formerly known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, increases the risk of several abdominal cancers, with the highest population prevalence. Familial adenomatous polyposis and some of the more infrequent polyposis syndromes have distinct characteristics affecting various organ-specific cancer risks. Hereditary gastric and pancreatic cancer syndromes include those also causing colorectal cancer, while additional genetic disorders predisposing only to upper gastrointestinal malignancies have been recognized more recently. Diagnosing and managing hereditary cancer syndromes requires multidisciplinary expertise and may be best managed in tertiary centres, with a need to consider patient preference and ensure shared decision-making. CONCLUSION: Several germline conditions predispose to colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer, which inform identification, surveillance regimens, prevention, cascade screening, counselling, and surgical management. The authors describe developments in the hereditary origin of colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer with current recommendations in surveillance and surgical management.",2023,May,BJS Open,7,3,,,10.1093/bjsopen/zrad023,37165697,#1248,Seppälä 2023,,,0
Is it preferable to administer a bronchodilator once- or twice-daily when treating COPD?,Matera MG; Rinaldi B; Ambrosio C; Cazzola M,"Nocturnal and early morning symptoms are common and uncomfortable in many patients with COPD, and are likely to affect their long-term outcomes. However, it is still debated whether it is better to give long-acting bronchodilators once- or twice-daily to symptomatic COPD patients. The functional link between circadian rhythms of autonomic tone and airway calibre explains why the timing of administration of bronchodilators in chronic airway diseases can induce different effects when taken at different biological (circadian) times. However, the timing also depends on the pharmacological characteristics of the bronchodilator to be used. Because the profile of bronchodilation produced by once-daily vs. twice-daily long-acting bronchodilators differs throughout 24 h, selecting long-acting bronchodilators may be customized to specific patient preferences based on the need for further bronchodilation in the evening. This is especially helpful for people who experience respiratory symptoms at night or early morning. Compared to placebo, evening bronchodilator administration is consistently linked with persistent overnight improvements in dynamic respiratory mechanics and inspiratory neural drive. The current evidence indicates that nocturnal and early morning symptoms control is best handled by a LAMA taken in the evening. In contrast, it seems preferable to use a LABA for daytime symptoms. Therefore, it can be speculated that combining a LAMA with a LABA can improve bronchodilation and control symptoms better. Both LAMA and LABA must be rapid in their onset of action. Aclidinium/formoterol, a twice-daily combination, is the most studies of the available LAMA/LABA combinations in terms of impact on daytime and nocturnal symptoms.",2023,Nov-Dec,Respir Med,219,,107439,,10.1016/j.rmed.2023.107439,37879449,#710,Matera 2023,,,0
Young persons and healthcare professionals experience of virtual gastroenterology consultations: a multicentre survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Hubbard R; Brooks A; Arebi N; El-Khouly S; Kiparissi F; Mozdiak E; Muhammed R; Smith PJ; Zarate-Lopez N; Garrick V; Greenan-Barrett J; Baker S; Bradbury K; DelNero N; Narula P,"OBJECTIVE: To explore Young Persons (YP) and healthcare professionals (HCP) experiences of virtual consultations (VC) and establish whether developmentally appropriate healthcare can be delivered virtually. METHOD: YP and HCP questionnaire surveys were designed and piloted. Electronic questionnaire links were sent by post, email or text message January-April 2021 to YP aged 13-25 years old, with predefined chronic gastrointestinal conditions, attending a gastroenterology/hepatology VC. HCP undertaking VC were invited to complete staff questionnaire. Results were anonymous and collated using Excel version 2302. RESULTS: Five UK hospital trusts participated, with 35 HCP responses. Of the 100 YP completing the survey 66% were female and 34% male aged between 13 years and 25 years (median: 18 years). 13% were new appointments and 87% follow ups, 29% were by video, 69% by phone and 2% gave no response. 80% of HCP spoke to YP directly but not privately (69%). 87% of YP and 88% HCP found VC useful. 83% of YP want VC again, although 20% preferred face to face. 43% of HCP required improved phone/internet connection. 77% of YP required hospital appointments for tests following VC. CONCLUSIONS: Overall respondents were satisfied with VC, finding them useful, convenient and time saving. Successful VC rely on appropriate patient selection and availability of reliable technology.

Preference Elicitation and Treatment Decision-Making Among Men Diagnosed With Prostate Cancer: Randomized Controlled Trial Results of Healium.,Diefenbach MA; Marziliano A; Tagai EK; Pfister H; Lapitan E; Hall SJ; Vira M; Ibrahim S; Aibel K; Kutikov A; Horwitz EM; Miyamoto C; Reese AC; Miller SM,"BACKGROUND: Elicitation of patients' preferences is an integral part of shared decision-making, the recommended approach for prostate cancer decision-making. Existing decision aids for this population often do not specifically focus on patients' preferences. Healium is a brief interactive web-based decision aid that aims to elicit patients' treatment preferences and is designed for a low health literate population. OBJECTIVE: This study used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether Healium, designed to target preference elicitation, is as efficacious as Healing Choices, a comprehensive education and decision tool, in improving outcomes for decision-making and emotional quality of life. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who had not yet made a treatment decision were randomly assigned to the brief Healium intervention or Healing Choices, a decision aid previously developed by our group that serves as a virtual information center on prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. Assessments were completed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months post baseline, and included decisional outcomes (decisional conflict, satisfaction with decision, and preparation for decision-making), and emotional quality of life (anxiety/tension and depression), along with demographics, comorbidities, and health literacy. RESULTS: A total of 327 individuals consented to participate in the study (171 were randomized to the Healium intervention arm and 156 were randomized to Healing Choices). The majority of the sample was non-Hispanic (272/282, 96%), White (239/314, 76%), married (251/320, 78.4%), and was on average 62.4 (SD 6.9) years old. Within both arms, there was a significant decrease in decisional conflict from baseline to 6 weeks postbaseline (Healium, P≤.001; Healing Choices, P≤.001), and a significant increase in satisfaction with one's decision from 6 weeks to 3 months (Healium, P=.04; Healing Choices, P=.01). Within both arms, anxiety/tension (Healium, P=.23; Healing Choices, P=.27) and depression (Healium, P=.001; Healing Choices, P≤.001) decreased from baseline to 6 weeks, but only in the case of depression was the decrease statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Healium, our brief decision aid focusing on treatment preference elicitation, is as successful in reducing decisional conflict as our previously tested comprehensive decision aid, Healing Choices, and has the added benefit of brevity, making it the ideal tool for integration into the physician consultation and electronic medical record.

Acromegaly: Pathophysiological Considerations and Treatment Options Including the Evolving Role of Oral Somatostatin Analogs.,Daniel CP; Wagner MJ; Borne GE; Plaisance CJ; Ahmadzadeh S; Aquino A; Shekoohi S; Kaye AM; Cornett EM; Kaye AD,"Acromegaly is a condition most commonly diagnosed in the fifth decade of life and has numerous treatment options. In this regard, Mycapssa(®) is the first FDA-approved oral octreotide capsule for treating acromegaly, combining the efficacy of the somatostatin receptor ligand, octreotide, with the ease of a twice-daily oral capsule. Where surgical treatment is not an option, somatostatin analogs, including octreotide, are the first line of medical treatment for acromegaly, requiring regular subcutaneous or intramuscular injections administered by a patient's healthcare provider. Octreotide capsules (Mycapssa(®)) provide an alternative to these somatostatin receptor ligand injections by combining octreotide with other excipients to produce a transient permeability enhancer technology that improves paracellular transport of octreotide across the gastrointestinal wall into the small intestine. Across multiple trials, including open-label (CH-ACM-01), double-blind placebo-controlled (CHIASMA OPTIMAL), and open-label extension of the trial period (CHIASMA OPTIMAL OLE), Mycapssa(®) octreotide capsules maintained a consistent biochemical normalization of IGF-1 and GH levels, safety profiles similar to injected somatostatin receptor ligands, and patient preference to continued treatment with octreotide capsules. While clinical trial data supports the use of octreotide capsules (Mycapssa(®)) in the pharmacological management of GH and IGF-1 levels, very little data exist regarding the drug's efficacy, tolerability, and use in female or pediatric-specific populations. A better understanding of the efficacy, application, and role of oral octreotide capsules in the long-term medical management of acromegaly in a diversity of populations is imperative to best determine the risks/benefits for the clinician.",2023,Sep,Pathophysiology,30,3,377-388,,10.3390/pathophysiology30030029,37755395,#895,Daniel 2023,,,0
Non-pharmacological and nonsurgical interventions in male urinary incontinence: A scoping review.,Zhang Y; Hou S; Qi Z; Wu S; Zhu K; Wang W,"AIMS: To describe and synthesize non-pharmacological and nonsurgical interventions for male urinary incontinence from the existing literature. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodology suggested by Arksey and O'Malley: (1) identification of the research questions; (2) identification of relevant studies using a three-step search recommended by JBI: an initial search within PubMed and CINAHL, a comprehensive literature search within PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and literature search of references lists; (3) study selection; (4) data extraction and charting; (5) collation, summarization, and reporting of the results. The PRISMA-ScR Checklist was used to report. RESULTS: A total of 4602 studies were identified, of which 87 studies were included. Approximately 78% were randomized controlled trials. More than 88% of the participants were men with prostate cancer. Exercising pelvic floor muscles 30 times per day for 12 weeks was the most frequently reported. Parameters of electrical stimulation were typically set up to 50 Hz and 300 μs for frequency and width of pulse, respectively, and lasted for 15 min. Pure pelvic floor muscle training, Pilates, Yoga, whole body vibration, diaphragm/abdominal muscle training, micturition interruption exercise, acupuncture, and auriculotherapy showed positive effects on reducing urinary incontinence. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested implementing pelvic floor muscle training alone before or after surgery can both prompt the recovery of continence in men after prostate cancer surgery. The decision to use biofeedback or electrical stimulation to enhance the therapeutic effect of pelvic floor muscle training should be approached with caution. More rigorous designed studies are needed to validate the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine techniques and diverse novel methods.

Choosing Or Losing In Behavioral Health: A Study Of Patients' Experiences Selecting Telehealth Versus In-Person Care.,Sousa J; Smith A; Richard J; Rabinowitz M; Raja P; Mehrotra A; Busch AB; Huskamp HA; Uscher-Pines L,"It is not known how the growth of telehealth has affected patients' choice of visit modalities (telehealth versus in person). In 2023 we conducted a mixed-methods study that paired a nationally representative survey of 2,071 adults (including 571 who used behavioral health services) and semistructured interviews with twenty-six people with depression or bipolar disorder. We explored patients' experiences with visit modality selection and their agency in the decision. Approximately one-third of patients receiving therapy or medication visits reported that their clinicians did not offer both modalities. Thirty-two percent reported that they did not typically receive their preferred modality, and 45 percent did not believe that their clinician considered their modality preferences. Qualitative findings revealed that some clinicians did not elicit patients' modality preferences. Perceived lack of choice affected satisfaction and rapport with clinicians and encouraged some people to seek care elsewhere.

Real-World Evidence Comparing Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab in Antitumor Necrosis Factor-Experienced Patients With Crohn's Disease.,Kappelman MD; Adimadhyam S; Hou L; Wolfe AE; Smith S; Simon AL; Moyneur É; Reynolds JS; Toh S; Dobes A; Parlett LE; Haynes K; Selvan M; Ma Q; Nair V; Burris J; Dorand JE; Dawwas GK; Lewis JD; Long MD,"INTRODUCTION: Many patients with Crohn's disease (CD) lose response or become intolerant to antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy and subsequently switch out of class. We compared the effectiveness and safety of ustekinumab to vedolizumab in a large, geographically diverse US population of TNF-experienced patients with CD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using longitudinal claims data from a large US insurer (Anthem, Inc.). We identified patients with CD initiating vedolizumab or ustekinumab with anti-TNF treatment in the prior 6 months. Our primary outcome was treatment persistence for >52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included (i) all-cause hospitalization, (ii) hospitalization for CD with surgery, (iii) hospitalization for CD without surgery, and (iv) hospitalization for infection. Propensity score fine stratification was used to control for demographic and baseline clinical characteristics and prior treatments. RESULTS: Among 885 new users of ustekinumab and 490 new users of vedolizumab, we observed no difference in treatment persistence (adjusted risk ratio 1.09 [95% confidence interval 0.95-1.25]). Ustekinumab was associated with a lower rate of all-cause hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 0.73 [0.59-0.91]), nonsurgical CD hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 0.58 [0.40-0.83]), and hospitalization for infection (adjusted hazard ratio 0.56 [0.34-0.92]). DISCUSSION: This real-world comparative effectiveness study of anti-TNF-experienced patients with CD initiating vedolizumab or ustekinumab showed similar treatment persistence rates beyond 52 weeks, although secondary outcomes such as all-cause hospitalizations, nonsurgical CD hospitalizations, and hospitalizations for infection favored ustekinumab initiation. We, therefore, advocate for individualized decision making in this medically refractory population, considering patient preference and other factors such as cost and route of administration.",2023,Apr,Am J Gastroenterol,118,4,674-684,,10.14309/ajg.0000000000002068,36508681,#1373,Kappelman 2023,,,0

A meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis comparing nonoperative versus operative management for uncomplicated appendicitis: a focus on randomized controlled trials.,Brucchi F; Bracchetti G; Fugazzola P; Viganò J; Filisetti C; Ansaloni L; Dal Mas F; Cobianchi L; Danelli P,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to provide a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing conservative and surgical treatment in a population of adults with uncomplicated acute appendicitis. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL. We have exclusively incorporated randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies involving participants with complicated appendicitis or children were excluded. The variables considered are as follows: treatment complications, complication-free treatment success at index admission and at 1 year follow-up, length of hospital stay (LOS), quality of life (QoL) and costs. RESULTS: Eight RCTs involving 3213 participants (1615 antibiotics/1598 appendectomy) were included. There was no significant difference between the two treatments in terms of complication rates (RR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.61-1.04, P = 0.07, I(2) = 69%). Antibiotics had a reduced treatment efficacy compared with appendectomy (RR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.90, p < 0.00001, I(2) = 87%) and at 1 year was successful in 540 out of 837 (64.6%, RR = 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.77, p < 0.00001, I(2) = 81%) participants. There was no difference in LOS (mean difference - 0.58 days 95% confidence interval - 1.59 to 0.43, p = 0.26, I(2) = 99%). The trial sequential analysis has revealed that, concerning the three primary outcomes, it is improbable that forthcoming RCTs will significantly alter the existing body of evidence.

Frequency and clinical outcomes of pharmacist-driven switching from warfarin to direct oral anticoagulants in an underserved patient population: A retrospective cohort study.,Bartholomew RR; Noble BN; Stanislaw JJ; Viehmann M; Herink MC; Furuno JP,"PURPOSE: Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) medications have improved safety, efficacy, and laboratory monitoring requirements compared to warfarin. However, available data are limited on the frequency and clinical outcomes of pharmacist-driven warfarin-to-DOAC switches. We aimed to quantify the frequencies and rationale of warfarin-to-DOAC switches in an underserved population. We also assessed clinical outcomes and compliance with recommended laboratory monitoring after switches. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult (age 18 years or older) patients on warfarin who were assessed by a clinical pharmacist for switch appropriateness to a DOAC. Study data were collected via manual chart review and included demographics, comorbid illnesses, switch status, the rationale for or against switching, incidence of thromboses and bleeds within 6 months of the switch assessment, and the time to the first complete blood count and renal and hepatic function tests after the switch. Statistical analysis utilized descriptive statistics, including the mean and SD, median and interquartile range, and frequencies and percentages. RESULTS: Among 189 eligible patients, 108 (57%) were switched from warfarin to a DOAC. The primary rationales for switching were less monitoring (64%) and labile international normalized ratio (32%). The main reason against switching was DOAC inappropriateness (53%), such as in morbid obesity (14%). Patient preference was commonly cited in both groups (54% and 36%, respectively). The overall incidence of thrombotic events (9%) and bleeds (15%) after switch assessment was low. Laboratory monitoring after switches was consistent with current recommendations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an observational cross-sectional study with people with lung cancer throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey investigated patients' experiences and preferences regarding the delivery of cancer care to plan for post-pandemic care, as well as the pandemic's impact on their functional status (physical and psycho-social), exploring the role of age and frailty. RESULTS: Amongst 282 eligible participants, 88%, 86%, and 59% of patients reported feeling appropriately supported during the pandemic by their cancer centre, friends/family, and primary care services, respectively. Remote oncology consultations were delivered to 90% of patients during the pandemic, of which 3% did not meet patients' expectations. Regarding post-pandemic outpatient care preferences, face-to-face appointments were preferred by 93% for the first appointment, by 64% when discussing imaging results, and by 60% for reviews during anti-cancer treatments. Older patients aged 70 years and above were more likely to favour face-to-face appointments (p = 0.007), regardless of their frailty status. Patient preferences changed over time, with the more recent participants preferring remote appointments during anti-cancer treatments (p = 0.0278). Regarding the pandemic's impact, abnormal levels of anxiety and depression were found in 16% and 17% of patients, respectively. Younger patients experienced higher abnormal levels of anxiety and depression (p = 0.036, p = 0.021). Amongst the older sub-group, those with frailty had higher levels of anxiety and depression (p < 0.001). Amongst all participants, 54% reported a considerable negative impact from the pandemic on different aspects of their daily life, particularly emotional and psychological health and sleep patterns, which were more marked in younger patients and the older sub-group with frailty. Older patients without frailty reported the least impact on their functional status. DISCUSSION: There is a need for more personalised outpatient consultation options during cancer care. Whilst there is a preference for face-to-face consultations for older patients, following the pandemic there is a growing acceptance of remote consultations particularly during anti-cancer treatment. Older patients with lung cancer without frailty were less affected by the pandemic than those with frailty and younger patients, requiring less support from healthcare services.",2023,Apr,J Geriatr Oncol,14,3,101449,,10.1016/j.jgo.2023.101449,36870223,#1355,Gomes 2023,,,0
Effects of Participant's Choice of Different Digital Interventions on Outcomes for Binge-Spectrum Eating Disorders: A Pilot Doubly Randomized Preference Trial.,Linardon J; Shatte A; Messer M; McClure Z; Fuller-Tyszkiewicz M,"It is unclear whether offering individuals a choice between different digital intervention programs affects treatment outcomes. To generate initial insights, we conducted a pilot doubly randomized preference trial to test whether offering individuals with binge-spectrum eating disorder a choice between two digital interventions is causally linked with superior outcomes than random assignment to these interventions. Participants with recurrent binge eating were randomized to either a choice (n = 77) or no-choice (n = 78) group. Those in the choice group could choose one of the two digital programs, while those in the no-choice group were assigned a program at random. The two digital interventions (a broad and a focused program) took 4 weeks to complete, were based on cognitive-behavioral principles and have demonstrated comparable efficacy, but differ in scope, content, and targeted change mechanisms. Most participants (79%) allocated to the choice condition chose the broad program. While both groups experienced improvements in primary (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire global scores and number of binge eating episodes over the past month) and secondary outcomes (dietary restraint, body image concerns, etc.), no significant between-group differences were observed. The two groups did not differ on dropout rates, nor on most indices of intervention engagement. Findings provide preliminary insights towards the role of client preferences in digital mental health interventions for eating disorders. Client preferences may not determine outcomes when digital interventions are based on similar underlying principles, although larger trials are needed to confirm this.",2023,Mar,Behav Ther,54,2,303-314,,10.1016/j.beth.2022.09.007,36858761,#1438,Linardon 2023,,,0
Preferences for cardiovascular and pulmonary rehabilitation care: A discrete choice experiment among patients in Lebanon.,Farah R; Groot W; Pavlova M,"OBJECTIVE: Patient preferences are important in designing optimal rehabilitation care. The aim of this study is to assess preferences for rehabilitation care among two groups of respondents. DESIGN: An online discrete choice experiment survey was carried out. SETTING: We use data for Lebanon, a country where rehabilitation care is still underdeveloped. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who have undergone or are currently undergoing rehabilitation treatment (users) and those who have not (yet) used rehabilitation care (non-users). INTERVENTION: Patients were asked to repeatedly choose between two hypothetical rehabilitation care packages with seven different attributes: attitude of the staff, travel time to clinic, out-of-pocket costs, medical equipment, rehabilitation plan, additional lifestyle education session, and support during rehabilitation care. MAIN MEASURES: Preference heterogeneity among patients with different characteristics was investigated using random effect binary logistic regression (software package Stata 15). RESULTS: In total, 126 respondents completed the survey. The most preferred attribute was an informal and friendly attitude of the staff followed by modern medical equipment, additional lifestyle education session via eHealth, and support during the rehabilitation program via phone call or SMS. Respondents were less in favor of going to the rehabilitation clinic and paying additional out-of-pocket costs for the rehabilitation treatment. This rank order was similar between users and non-users. CONCLUSION: Preferences of patients regarding the type of program chosen (eHealth or at clinical-based) need to be included in future rehabilitation programs. Improving patient experience with rehabilitation programs by giving the best care based on a patient-centered approach is essential.",2023,Jul,Clin Rehabil,37,7,954-963,,10.1177/02692155221149371,36583599,#1135,Farah 2023,,,1
A real-world retrospective single-centre study of the cost-effectiveness and long-term outcomes of pegylated interferon for chronic hepatitis B.,Congly SE; Syed A; Haylock-Jacobs S; Israelson H; Pinto J; Williams S; Lee SS; Coffin CS,"BACKGROUND: Pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) is recommended as first-line therapy for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) but has significant side effects and is rarely used compared to oral nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA). There are limited recent clinical efficacy or economic analysis data comparing approved CHB therapy in North America. METHODS: This retrospective study examined clinical outcomes, off-treatment durability, and cost-effectiveness of Peg-IFN versus NA for CHB. Demographic (age, sex, ethnicity), clinical data (i.e., liver tests, hepatitis B virus DNA, serology, transient elastography) and documented side effects were collected by retrospective chart review of patients followed in the University of Calgary Liver Unit who received Peg-IFN therapy from January 2007 to December 2020. The cost-effectiveness of Peg-IFN versus NA therapy was modelled over a 10-year time horizon. RESULTS: Sixty-eight CHB patients were treated with Peg-IFN (median age 45.65, 74% male, 84% Asian); 50/68 (74%) completed 48 weeks of treatment with a median follow-up of 6.54 years (interquartile range 5.07). At the last known follow-up, 23/68 (34%) have not required NA treatment and one had HBsAg loss; 27 have been started on NA. Predictors of obtaining a sustained virological response included being hepatitis B e antigen-negative at treatment end and a quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen <1000 IU/mL. Economic modelling showed that finite Peg-IFN was not cost-effective versus NA at a 10-year time horizon. CONCLUSIONS: PEG-IFN remains a potential treatment for CHB although there is a significant intolerance/failure rate. Using PEG-IFN based on patient preference is reasonable and optimal patient selection may improve treatment cost-effectiveness.",2023,Oct,Can Liver J,6,3,305-313,,10.3138/canlivj-2022-0043,38020196,#757,Congly 2023,,,0
Patient preferences of patient selection criteria for upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation: A qualitative study.,Vanterpool KB; Gacki-Smith J; Downey MC; Nordstrom M; Luken M; Riggleman T; Fichter S; Altema W; Jensen SE; Dumanian GA; Cooney CM; Levan ML; Tintle S; Brandacher G; Gordon EJ,"BACKGROUND: Upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation is a life-enhancing reconstructive treatment option that aims to improve recipients' quality of life and maximize function. This study assessed upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation patient selection criteria perceptions among individuals with upper extremity limb loss. The perceptions of individuals with upper extremity limb loss on patient selection criteria may enable vascularized composite allotransplantation centers to improve criteria to avoid mismatched expectations about the posttransplant vascularized composite allotransplantation experience and outcomes. Realistic patient expectations may increase patient adherence, improve outcomes, and reduce vascularized composite allotransplantation graft loss. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with civilian and military service members with upper extremity limb loss and upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation candidates, participants, and recipients from three US institutions. Interviews assessed perceptions of patient selection criteria for suitability as a candidate for upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation. Thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. RESULTS: A total of 50 individuals participated (66% participation rate). Most participants were male (78%), White (72%), with a unilateral limb loss (84%), and a mean age of 45 years. Six themes emerged regarding upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation patient selection criteria, including support for candidates who: (1) are of younger age, (2) are in good physical health, (3) have mental stability, (4) are willing to ""put in the work,"" (5) have specific amputation characteristics, and (6) have sufficient social support. Patients had preferences about selecting candidates with unilateral versus bilateral limb loss. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that numerous factors, including medical, social, and psychological characteristics, inform patients' perceptions of patient selection criteria for upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation. Patient perceptions of patient selection criteria should inform the development of validated screening measures that optimize patient outcomes.",2023,,SAGE Open Med,11,,20503121231181236,,10.1177/20503121231181236,37342616,#1160,Vanterpool 2023,,,0
Patient Engagement in and Adaptations to Delivery of Outpatient Care for Opioid Use Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,Zhou X; Thompson LK; Pagano A; Rahman N; Patel S; Gibson D; Ibrahim A; Casanova B; Schwartz RP; Vocci FJ; Clarke DE,"OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated adaptations to outpatient care delivery and changes in treatment demand and engagement among patients receiving medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in the months after the declaration of the COVID-19 public health emergency in 2020. METHODS: Data were collected through an online survey (June-November 2020) of outpatient MOUD prescribers. The survey obtained information on outpatient practices' adaptations to MOUD treatment and urine drug screening (UDS) and elicited provider views on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient demand for, and engagement in, treatment. Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine associations among practice characteristics, patient engagement, and service adaptations. RESULTS: Of 516 respondents, 74% reported adaptations to MOUD delivery during the pandemic. Most respondents implemented virtual visits for initial (67%) and follow-up (77%) contacts. Prescribers of buprenorphine were more likely than those who did not prescribe the medication to report MOUD adaptations. Among respondents reporting any MOUD adaptation, 77% made adaptations to their UDS practices. Among 513 respondents who answered COVID-19-related questions, 89% reported that the pandemic had affected the treatment and engagement of their patients. Of these respondents, 30% reported increased difficulty with patient engagement, and 45% reported that their patients preferred virtual visits during this period, whereas 18% endorsed patient preference for in-person visits. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth and federal regulatory easements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic enabled providers to continue treating patients for opioid use disorder in 2020. The results suggest that care adaptations and changes in patient demand and engagement were common in the practices surveyed.",2024,Mar,Psychiatr Serv,75,3,258-267,,10.1176/appi.ps.202100507,37855101,#314,Zhou 2024,,,0
Smartphone Application Versus Standard Instruction for Colonoscopic Preparation: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,Patel SV; Yu D; Taylor C; McKay J; Hookey L,"OBJECTIVE: To compare smartphone application (Colonoscopic Preparation) instructions versus paper instructions for bowel preparation for colonoscopy. BACKGROUND: Adhering to bowel preparation instructions is important to ensure a high-quality colonoscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included individuals undergoing colonoscopy at a tertiary care hospital. Individuals were randomized (1:1) to receive instructions through a smartphone application or traditional paper instructions. The primary outcome was the quality of the bowel preparation as measured by the Boston Bowel Preparation Score. Secondary outcomes included cecal intubation and polyp detection. Patient satisfaction was assessed using a previously developed questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 238 individuals were randomized (n = 119 in each group), with 202 available for the intention-to-treat analysis (N = 97 in the app group and 105 in the paper group). The groups had similar demographics, indications for colonoscopy, and type of bowel preparation. The primary outcome (Boston Bowel Preparation Score) demonstrated no difference between groups (Colonoscopic Preparation app mean: 7.26 vs paper mean: 7.28, P = 0.91). There was no difference in cecal intubation (P = 0.37), at least one polyp detected (P = 0.43), or the mean number of polyps removed (P = 0.11). A higher proportion strongly agreed or agreed that they would use the smartphone app compared with paper instructions (89.4% vs 70.1%, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone instructions performed similarly to traditional paper instructions for those willing to use the application. Local patient preferences need to be considered before making changes in the method of delivery of medical instructions.",2024,Mar,J Clin Gastroenterol,,,,,10.1097/MCG.0000000000001988,38489496,#235,Patel 2024,,,0
Stability of Stated Preferences: Vaccine Priority Setting before and during the First COVID-19 Lockdown.,Luyten J; Kessels R,"BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are frequently used to study preferences and quantify tradeoffs in decision making. It is important to understand how stable their results are. OBJECTIVE: To investigate to what extent an extreme change in context, the COVID-19 pandemic, affected preferences for vaccine priority setting, as observed in an earlier DCE. METHODS: We replicated a DCE in which participants had to prioritize vaccination programs for public funding. The initial DCE was executed in Flanders (Belgium) right before the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (December 2019, N = 1,636). The replicated DCE was executed 6 months later when the population was in lockdown (April 2020, N = 1,127). A total of 612 respondents participated in both waves of the DCE. We used panel mixed logit models to quantify attribute and level importance and compared utility estimates for consistency. RESULTS: The number of vaccine-preventable deaths became less important during the pandemic than before, whereas the influential attributes, the vaccine's contribution to disease eradication and certainty about vaccine effectiveness became even more important. Respondents attached equal importance to the number of patients with transient or permanent morbidity, to the disease's economic impact as well as to its equity profile. CONCLUSION: Different preferences for vaccine priority setting were observed during the first COVID-19 lockdown as compared with before, although these differences were, given the extreme nature of the changing circumstances, relatively small. HIGHLIGHTS: We replicated a discrete choice experiment (DCE) about vaccine priority setting during the first COVID-19 lockdown and compared results with those from the original setting.The major attributes, contribution to disease eradication, and scientific certainty about vaccine effectiveness became even more important than they already were, whereas avoidable mortality became less important.Respondents attached equal importance to the number of patients with transient or permanent morbidity, to the disease's economic impact as well as to its equity profile.An extreme change in directly related context to the choice assignment led to changes in stated preferences, although these changes were relatively small, given the extreme change in context.Priorities in the second DCE were even less aligned with cost-effectiveness analysis than those observed initially.",2023,May,Med Decis Making,43,4,521-529,,10.1177/0272989X221150185,36688420,#1291,Luyten 2023,,,1
Development of attributes and attribute levels for a discrete choice experiment on patients' and providers' choice for antiretroviral therapy service in Northwest Ethiopia.,Belay YA; Yitayal M; Atnafu A; Taye FA,"BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are used to assess the strength of preferences and value of interventions. However, researchers using this approach have been criticized for not conducting or publishing rigorous studies to select the required attributes and levels. Proper specification of attributes and their levels determines the validity of DCE. Hence, our study aimed to identify and define attributes and levels for the design of a DCE to elicit patients' and providers' preferences for ART service in Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: Four stages were followed to derive the final list of attributes and levels: (1) a literature review to derive conceptual attributes; (2) key informant interviews of 17 providers and in-depth interviews of 15 adult stable patients to identify context-specific attributes and attribute levels; (3) ranking survey among 31 HIV/AIDS program implementers and rating survey among 35 adult stable patients and 42 health workers providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) service to indicate participants' preference of attributes; and (4) an expert opinion to reduce the list of attributes and levels. RESULTS: First, a literature review identified 23 candidate attributes. Second, individual-level analysis of the qualitative transcripts confirmed 15 of these 23 attributes. Third, the ranking and rating surveys put the importance of the 23 ART service attributes in order of preference. Fourth, through discussions with eight experts, 17 attributes were discarded based on multiple criteria. The six retained attributes were: the location of ART refills, the frequency of receiving ART refills, the person providing ART refills, the participants/others seen at the same ART refill visit, medication refill pick-up/delivery times, and the total cost of the visit during antiretroviral (ARV) medication refill. Finally, levels were assigned to these 6 attributes based on data from the literature, transcripts, and knowledge of the Ethiopian context. CONCLUSIONS: This detailed description illuminates the attribute development process and provides the reader with a basis for evaluating the rigor of this phase of DCE construction. This paper contributes empirical evidence to the limited methodological literature on attributes and levels of development for DCE, thereby providing further empirical guidance on ART service preference, specifically among patients of low- and middle-income countries.",2023,Jun,AIDS Res Ther,20,1,33,,10.1186/s12981-023-00531-1,37271808,#1169,Belay 2023,,,1
Comparison between two patient-reported outcome measures for patients with cervical radiculopathy: A think-aloud study.,Thoomes E; de Graaf M; Gallina A; Falla D; Stathi A,"BACKGROUND: The Cervical Radiculopathy Impact Scale (CRIS) and Patient Specific Functional Scale 2.0 (PSFS 2.0) are patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) used to assess activity limitations in patients with cervical radiculopathy (CR). This study a) compared the CRIS subscale 3 and the PSFS 2.0 in patients with CR with respect to completeness and patient preference, b) established the correlation between both PROMs in assessing the individual patient's level of functional limitations and c) assessed the frequency of reported functional limitations. METHODS: Participants with CR participated in semi-structured, individual, face-to-face interviews as part of a ""think-aloud"" process; verbalising their thoughts while completing both PROMs. Sessions were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were recruited. The most frequently reported functional limitation on the CRIS was: 'working at a computer' (n = 17) and overhead activities' (n = 10) for the PSFS 2.0. There was significant moderate positive correlation between the scores on the PSFS 2.0 and the CRIS (Spearman's r = 0.55, n = 22 p = .008). Most patients (n = 18; 82%) preferred the ability to present their own individual functional limitations of the PSFS 2.0. Eleven participants (50%) preferred the 11-point scale of the PSFS 2.0 over the 5-point Likert scale scoring option of the CRIS. CONCLUSION: Both easy to complete PROMs capture functional limitations in patients with CR. Most patients prefer the PSFS 2.0 over the CRIS. The wording and layout of both PROMs need refinement to enhance user-friendliness and avoid misinterpretation.",2023,Jun,Musculoskelet Sci Pract,65,,102764,,10.1016/j.msksp.2023.102764,37094507,#1198,Thoomes 2023,,,0
Qualitative study of guideline panelists: innovative surveys provided valuable insights regarding patient values and preferences.,Zeng L; Li SA; Yang M; Yan L; Helsingen LM; Bretthauer M; Agoritsas T; Vandvik PO; Mustafa RA; Busse J; Siemieniuk RAC; Lytvyn L; Zhang L; Brignardello-Petersen R; Guyatt GH,"OBJECTIVES: To explore guideline panelists' understanding of panel surveys for eliciting panels' inferences regarding patient values and preferences, and the influence of the surveys on making recommendations. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We performed sampling and data collection from all four guideline panels that had conducted the surveys through October 2020. We collected the records of all panel meetings and interviewed some panelists in different roles. We applied inductive thematic analysis for analyzing and interpreting data. RESULTS: We enrolled four guideline panels with 99 panelists in total and interviewed 25 of them. Most panelists found the survey was easy to follow and facilitated the incorporation of patient values and preferences in the tradeoffs between benefits and harms or burdens. The variation of patient preferences and uncertainty regarding patient values and preferences reflected in the surveys helped the panels ponder the strength of recommendations. In doing so, the survey results enhanced a rationale for panels' decision on the recommendations. CONCLUSION: The panel surveys have proved to help guideline panels explicitly consider and incorporate patient values and preferences in making recommendations. Guideline panels would benefit from widespread use of the panel surveys, particularly when primary evidence regarding patient values and preferences is scarce.",2023,Sep,J Clin Epidemiol,161,,173-180,,10.1016/j.jclinepi.2023.07.014,37517505,#909,Zeng 2023,,,0
Experiences of people with multiple sclerosis and clinicians in using cognitive behavioural therapies for hidden symptoms: a systematic review and meta-aggregation.,Feng G; Posa S; Sureshkumar A; Simpson S; Bruno T; Morrow SA; Donkers S; Knox K; Feinstein A; Bayley M; Munce S; Simpson R,"PURPOSE: Cognitive behavioural therapies (CBTs) are a standard of care for treatment of many 'hidden symptoms' in people with MS (PwMS), such as stress, depression, and fatigue. However, these interventions can vary widely in formatting and may not be tailored for PwMS. To optimize CBTs for MS, understanding the experiences of PwMS and clinicians is essential. This systematic review and meta-aggregation synthesizes existing qualitative data on stakeholder perspectives of CBTs for PwMS. METHODS: Systematic searches across five major electronic databases were conducted. Studies reporting qualitative data were identified. Two reviewers performed screening, quality assessment, data extraction, and certainty of evidence assessments. Meta-aggregation was performed as per the Joanna Briggs Institute approach, entailing qualitative data extraction, developing categories, and synthesizing overall findings. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included in this review, comprising data from 653 PwMS and 47 clinicians. In the meta-aggregation, 122 qualitative results were extracted and grouped into nine categories. Categories were then combined into six synthesized findings: (1) setting the context-life with MS, (2) reasons for participating in CBTs, (3) acceptability of and experiences with participating in CBTs, (4) perceived benefits of CBTs, (5) perceived challenges with CBTs, and (6) suggestions to improve CBTs for PwMS. CONCLUSIONS: A range of benefits including psychological, social, and lifestyle improvements were reported, but varied based on the design of the CBT intervention. Future CBT interventions should be tailored to participant needs, delivered in group settings, offer online options, and be delivered by a trained facilitator familiar with MS. Further exploration of the ideal CBT design for PwMS, as well as engagement with caregivers and clinicians treating MS, is warranted.",2024,Mar,J Neurol,271,3,1084-1107,,10.1007/s00415-023-12116-z,38219252,#291,Feng 2024,,,0
The 2022 Updated European Association of Urology Guidelines on the Use of Adjuvant Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy for Renal Cell Carcinoma.,Bedke J; Albiges L; Capitanio U; Giles RH; Hora M; Ljungberg B; Marconi L; Klatte T; Volpe A; Abu-Ghanem Y; Dabestani S; Fernández-Pello S; Hofmann F; Kuusk T; Tahbaz R; Powles T; Bex A,"In KEYNOTE-564, adjuvant pembrolizumab, a PD-1 antibody, significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) in localised clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) with a high risk of relapse. In 2021, the European Association of Urology RCC Guidelines Panel issued a weak recommendation for adjuvant pembrolizumab for high-risk ccRCC as defined by the trial until final overall survival data and results from other trials were available. Meanwhile, the primary DFS endpoints were not met for adjuvant atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor; IMmotion010), adjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab (CheckMate 914), or perioperative nivolumab (PROSPER). Owing to heterogeneity, a meta-analysis is not recommended. Pembrolizumab remains the only immune checkpoint inhibitor currently recommended in this setting. Overall survival data are immature and biomarkers to predict outcome are lacking. Uncertainty exists and overtreatment is occurring. Treatment decisions should be made with caution and with the involvement of each patient. PATIENT SUMMARY: New results from three trials of immunotherapy after surgery for kidney cancer to reduce the risk of recurrence showed no improvement with these treatments. These results are in contrast to an earlier study that showed that the antibody pembrolizumab did extend the time before kidney cancer recurrence, even though it is not yet clear if overall survival is longer. Thus, we cautiously recommend pembrolizumab as additional treatment in high-risk kidney cancer after surgery, but patient preference should be carefully considered and the risk of overtreatment should be discussed.",2023,Jan,Eur Urol,83,1,10-14,,10.1016/j.eururo.2022.10.010,36511268,#1631,Bedke 2023,,,0
Representation of women in orthopaedic surgery: perception of barriers among undergraduate medical students in Saudi Arabia.,Alomar AZ; Almonaie S; Nagshabandi KN; AlGhufaili D; Alomar M,"BACKGROUND: While female participation has improved in several surgical specialties over time globally, no such increase has been observed in orthopaedic surgery over the past decades. The potential barriers to female participation are likely present from the beginning of medical education. Therefore, this study assessed the apparent lag in equal representation among men and women in orthopaedic surgery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a questionnaire survey to investigate medical students' and interns' perceptions of women participating in orthopaedic surgery, their subspeciality preferences, and barriers preventing them from pursuing an orthopaedic career. The responses were analysed to understand general perceptions, gender-based differences, impact of clinical experiential learning, and exposure to orthopaedic surgery. RESULTS: Approximately 565 medical students (49% females, 51% males) participated in the survey. Only 17% of students (11% females, 23% males) considered orthopaedic surgery as their future career option. While 31% of female and 17% of male students disagreed with the concept of female-appropriate orthopaedic subspecialties, most of the remaining male and female students perceived paediatric orthopaedics as a female-appropriate subspecialty. Concerning equal representation of women, gender bias and lack of a strong physique were the most frequently selected barriers by female and male students, respectively. Patient preference for male orthopaedicians, gender discrimination, social and family commitments, and need for physical strength were all perceived as barriers for women in orthopaedics. Overall, clinical experience and orthopaedic exposure did not significantly improve the likelihood of female students in choosing orthopaedic surgery as a career. CONCLUSIONS: The bias against women in orthopaedic careers is prevalent among medical students early in their academic years. Clinical experience and exposure to orthopaedic surgery should be improved to make a significant impact on female participation in orthopaedic careers. Career building efforts in terms of improved career opportunities, career counselling, flexible working hours, social and family related adjustments and implementation of mentorship/research/fellowship programmes for females are needed to reduce gender discrimination and improve female orthopaedic participation. Furthermore, process improvements may yield greater flexibility for women pursuing the challenging field while accommodating other barriers faced by women in orthopaedic surgery.",2023,Jan,J Orthop Surg Res,18,1,19,,10.1186/s13018-022-03487-6,36611180,#1598,Alomar 2023,,,0

Cancer patients' experiences and preferences when receiving bad news: a qualitative study.,Krieger T; Salm S; Dresen A; Cecon N,"PURPOSE: Receiving a cancer diagnosis significantly impacts patients' lives, and how the bad news is delivered influences patients' trajectory, psychosocial adjustment and openness to psycho-oncological support. We explored how patients' experiences, reactions and preferences were when receiving the news and which optimization recommendations can be made. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study with patients who enrolled in the new integrated cross-sectoral psycho-oncological care programme 'isPO', being enrolled 12 months post-diagnosis. Data on the main issue (i.e. perception of the moment when the diagnosis is received) were collected via telephone interviews that were fully audiotaped and transcribed. Two independent coders conducted inductive content analyses using MAXQDA. RESULTS: Out of 38 approached patients, 23 cancer patients with 13 different tumour entities participated. They had a mean age of 54.2 (SD 16.2); n = 17 (74%) were female. Three major themes with 14 corresponding subthemes emerged: (1) patients' experiences with the bad news delivery, including setting, mode, preparation and perceived needs; (2) patients' reactions to the bad news, such as shock, fear and helplessness, disbelief and denial, anger and feeling of injustice, thankfulness and depression; and (3) patients' receiving preferences, including psycho-oncological support, addressing informational needs, needs-driven comprehensive support and a competent multidisciplinary support team.

Impact of advance care planning and end-of-life conversations on patients with cancer: An integrative review of literature.,Goswami P,"PURPOSE: The purpose was to review published articles to examine the impact of advance care planning (ACP) and end-of-life (EOL) conversations on patients with cancer, and aimed to compare the findings for congruency with the goals of ACP. DESIGN AND METHOD: The study was guided by Whittemore and Knafl's integrative review methodology. Articles published between 2015 to 2020 were identified through electronic databases. The search included: Cumulative Index for Nursing Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, MEDLINE-Ovid, and MEDLINE full text, and using the MeSH terms. Two hundred and five (205) articles were identified and screened for eligibility, and 15 articles were appraised. FINDINGS: The fifteen (15) articles that met the inclusion criteria included five (5) qualitative, eight (8) quantitative, and two (2) mixed methods. The review analysis revealed six themes emerged in three categories: cancer patients' experience with advance care planning (1) patients' prognostic awareness, (2) decision making; cancer patients' perceived outcomes with advance care planning (3) patient-provider relationship, (4) concordance in care based on goals, and cancer patients' propositions related to advance care planning, (5) timings of advance care planning discussions, and (6) support during ACP and/or EOL conversations.

Stroke survivors' preferences for post-stroke self-management programs: A discrete choice experiment.,Doshi K; Henderson SL; Seah DJL; De Silva DA; Lee JJ; Huynh VA; Ozdemir S,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Self-management programs enhance survival in stroke patients. However, they require patient-centered designs to be effective. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the type of post-stroke self-management programs that appeal to stroke survivors, and to estimate their willingness to participate in such programs. METHODS: A Discrete Choice Experiment was administered to patients who had either a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke within the past 3 years and were cognitively intact (i.e., stroke survivors). Stroke survivors were presented with eight choice tasks and asked to choose between 'No Program' and two hypothetical post-stroke management programs that varied by six attributes: Topics covered by the program; schedule of the program; frequency and duration of the sessions; number of participants; out-of-pocket registration fee for the whole program; and rewards for completing the program. RESULTS: The analysis involved 146 stroke survivors. Based on the mixed logit model, the predicted willingness to participate ranged from 53% to 76%. The most popular characteristics in a program were topics on health education and risk management, being scheduled during weekends as four sessions that are each 2 hours long and involve four participants, a registration fee of SGD50 (∼USD36), and SGD500 (∼USD359) reward for program completion. CONCLUSIONS: Interest in post-stroke self-management programs was high, with at least half of the sample showing interest in participating in these programs.

Listening to music during intranasal (es)ketamine therapy in patients with treatment-resistant depression correlates with better tolerability and reduced anxiety.,Hauser J; Sarlon J; Liwinski T; Brühl AB; Lang UE,"BACKGROUND: Although the effectiveness of (es)ketamine for therapy-resistant depression (TRD) has been established, potential treatment-limiting factors include side effects like dissociation, anxiety, or elevated blood pressure. Music can reduce stress and negative emotions as anxiety. This study aimed to investigate the impact of listening to music during intranasal (es)ketamine administration on both tolerability and efficacy. METHODS: Records of 494 sessions (of 37 patients) with intranasal (es)ketamine administration, each containing data of blood pressure measurements, DSS-IV (dissociation symptoms scale-IV), anxiety and euphoria analogue scale, MADRS (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale) and BDI (Beck's Depression Inventory) were evaluated. RESULTS: The between-group analysis, comparing participants who listened to music with those who did not, revealed significant differences in the administered dose (p-value: 0.003, mean: 131.5 mg with music vs. 116.7 mg without music), scores on the DSS Item 1 (p-value: 0.005, mean: 3 points vs. 2.4 points), levels of anxiety (p-value: <0.001, mean: 0.4 points vs. 1.4 points), and measurements of maximal systolic blood pressure after administration (p-value: 0.017, mean: 137.9 mmHg vs. 140.3 mmHg). Listening to music had no impact on the MARDS-change score between the sessions. LIMITATIONS: Key limitations include a non-randomized naturalistic design and the non-standardized selection of music, which was based on individual patient preferences. CONCLUSION: Listening to music during intranasal (es)ketamine therapy appears to be linked to reduced anxiety and lower blood pressure, stable or increased dissociation levels, and improved tolerance for higher doses. These findings could potentially contribute to the optimization of (es)ketamine therapy, both in terms of treatment efficacy and managing side effects.",2024,,Front Psychiatry,15,,1327598,,10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1327598,38322143,#461,Hauser 2024,,,0
Conventional standard-sized bra with prosthesis or patient's bra with customized hand-knitted external prosthesis after mastectomy: Mixed-methods evaluation of patients' preferences.,Ng RP; Allen JC; Chia YY; Lim GH,"INTRODUCTION: In breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy without reconstruction, an external breast prosthesis could aid patients' recovery, improve body image and confidence by helping to regain a symmetrical chest appearance when dressed. However, external breast prosthesis preferences among Asian breast cancer patients were not widely studied. We aimed to compare patients' experience with the conventional commercially manufactured standard-sized (small, medium, large, extra-large) bra and prosthesis versus customized hand-knitted external breast prosthesis with patient's bra after unilateral mastectomy at a tertiary hospital. This is the first such study in Asian women, to our knowledge. METHODS: In this prospective study, participants used the conventional bra-prosthesis followed by the customized one consecutively, each for at least 3 months before they were administered an identical questionnaire at 3 and 6 months respectively. The questionnaire assessed the patients' experience with the prosthesis on the aspects of comfort, body image and satisfaction etc. Patients were also invited for in-depth interviews. RESULTS: Of 155 eligible patients, 148 patients participated with a response rate of 95.5%. 99 (67%) participants preferred the customized prosthesis, while 38 (25.7%) did not. 11 (7.4%) participants were undecided. Seventeen participants underwent in-depth interviews until data saturation on major qualitative themes was achieved. More patients experienced excessive sweating (p < 0.0001), greater discomfort (p = 0.0195) and higher rates of prosthesis dislodgement (p = 0.0269) with the conventional bra-prosthesis. CONCLUSION: Customized external breast prostheses could be an alternative to the conventional ones for breast cancer patients with mastectomy, with additional benefits of less sweating, more comfort and less dislodgement perceived.",2023,,Breast Dis,42,1,375-382,,10.3233/BD-230040,38073368,#1607,Ng 2023,,,0
Women's preference for a vaginal birth in Brazilian private hospitals: effects of a quality improvement project.,Domingues RMSM; Dias MAB; do Carmo Leal M,"BACKGROUND: In 2015, a quality improvement project called ""Adequate Childbirth Project"" (PPA) was implemented in Brazilian private hospitals in order to reduce cesarean sections without clinical indication. The PPA is structured in four components, one of which is directed at women and families. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of PPA on women's preference for vaginal birth (VB) at the end of pregnancy. METHODS: Evaluative research conducted in 12 private hospitals participating in the PPA. Interviews were carried out in the immediate postpartum period and medical record data were collected at hospital discharge. The implementation of PPA activities and women's preference for type of birth at the beginning and end of pregnancy were compared in women assisted in the PPA model of care and in the standard of care model, using a chi-square statistical test. To estimate the effect of PPA on women's preference for VB at the end of pregnancy, multiple logistic regression was performed with selection of variables using a causal diagram. RESULTS: Four thousand seven hundred ninety-eight women were interviewed. The implementation of the planned activities of PPA was less than 50%, but were significantly more frequent among women assisted in the PPA model of care. Women in this group also showed a greater preference for VB at the beginning and end of pregnancy. The PPA showed an association with greater preference for VB at the end of pregnancy in primiparous (OR 2.54 95% CI 1.99-3.24) and multiparous women (OR 1.44 95% CI 0.97-2.12), although in multiparous this association was not significant. The main factor associated with the preference for VB at the end of pregnancy was the preference for this type of birth at the beginning of pregnancy, both in primiparous (OR 18.67 95% CI 14.22-24.50) and in multiparous women (OR 53.11 95% CI 37.31-75.60). CONCLUSIONS: The PPA had a positive effect on women's preference for VB at the end of pregnancy. It is plausible that more intense effects are observed with the expansion of the implementation of the planned activities. Special attention should be given to information on the benefits of VB in early pregnancy.",2024,Mar,Reprod Health,20,Suppl 2,188,,10.1186/s12978-024-01771-8,38549093,#205,DominguesRMSM 2024,,,0

We describe our experience with TNT consisting of induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy using full dose 5FU without oxaliplatin. METHODS: Adults with biopsy-proven, newly diagnosed LARC with high-risk characteristics on pelvic MRI (T4a or T4b, extramural vascular invasion, N2, mesorectal fascia involvement, enlargement/tumor deposits on lateral lymph nodes) were included. The TNT protocol comprised of six biweekly courses of modified FOLFOX6 followed by pelvic RT with four concurrent cycles of biweekly 5-FU 2600 mg/m2 + LV 200 mg/m2 without oxaliplatin to complete 20 uninterrupted weeks of full dose 5FU. Surgery was planned 11-13 weeks after completing chemoradiotherapy. RESULTS: Eighty-four LARC patients, including 26% with signet-ring cell carcinoma, with high-risk MRI characteristics were treated with the TNT protocol with a 96% completion rate. Significant (> grade 3) toxicities included neutropenia (23.8%), diarrhea (14.2%) anemia (10.7%), and two deaths. The median DFS at 2 years was 22.5 months with better survival noted for those who underwent surgery or had cCR (with NOM) compared to those who did not undergo surgery (due to progression, inadequate regression, or patient preference despite residual disease) -mDFS 27.7 months versus 11.4 months, p =  < 0.0001 and mOS 29.2 months versus 15 months p =  < 0.0001.

Patient preferences for anti-hyperglycaemic medication for type 2 diabetes mellitus in China: findings from a national survey.,Liu S; Liu J; Si L; Ke X; Liu L; Ren Y; Bao S; Li F; Yu Y; Pan Q; Wei Y; Chen Y,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the preferences regarding risks, benefits and other treatment attributes of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in China when selecting a second-line anti-hyperglycaemic medicine. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment with hypothetical anti-hyperglycaemic medication profiles was performed using a face-to-face survey administered to patients with T2DM. The medication profile was described using seven attributes: treatment efficacy, hypoglycaemia risk, cardiovascular benefits, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events, weight change, mode of administration and out-of-pocket cost. Participants chose between medication profiles by comparing attributes. Data were analysed using a mixed logit model with marginal willingness to pay (mWTP) and maximum acceptable risk (MAR) calculated. The preference heterogeneity within the sample was explored using a latent class model (LCM). RESULTS: A total of 3327 respondents from five major geographical regions completed the survey. Treatment efficacy, hypoglycaemia risk, cardiovascular benefits and GI adverse events were major concerns among the seven attributes measured. Weight change and mode of administration were of lesser concern. Regarding mWTP, respondents would pay ¥236.1 (US$36.6) for an anti-hyperglycaemic medication with an efficacy of 2.5% points reduction in HbA1c, while they were willing to accept a weight gain of 3 kg only if they received a compensation of ¥56.7 (US$8.8). Respondents were willing to accept a relatively large increase in hypoglycaemia risk (MAR=15.9%) to improve treatment efficacy from intermediate (1.0% points) to high (1.5% points). LCM identified the following four unobserved subgroups: trypanophobia, cardiovascular-benefits-focused, safety-focused and efficacy-focused and cost-sensitive. CONCLUSION: Patients with T2DM prioritised free out-of-pocket costs, highest efficacy, no hypoglycaemia risk and cardiovascular benefits over weight change and mode of administration. There exists great preference heterogeneity among patients, which should be taken into account in healthcare decision-making processes.",2023,Apr,BMJ Glob Health,8,4,,,10.1136/bmjgh-2022-010942,37041021,#1343,Liu 2023,,,1
Outcome measures for young people with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: A qualitative exploration of healthcare professionals' perceptions and practices.,Alamrani S; Gardner A; Falla D; Russell E; Rushton AB; Heneghan NR,"BACKGROUND: Limited knowledge exists on current use of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) and performance measures for adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), as well as health care professionals' (HCPs) perceived barriers and facilitators towards their use. This study's objectives were: 1) to explore current practice of HCPs when assessing outcomes for AIS 2) to understand perceived barriers and facilitators of HCPs to use PROMs 3) to understand perceived barriers and facilitators of HCPs to use performance measures. METHODS: A qualitative study recruited a purposive sample of HCPs from a tertiary hospital in the United Kingdom. Mean years of experience managing individuals with AIS was 11.8 years; and included surgeons, physiotherapists and nurses, educated at Bachelor, Masters and Doctoral level. Consent to participate and demographic information were collected in advance of the interviews. In-depth, virtual semi-structured interviews were informed by a topic guide based on current evidence. Interviews of approximately 45 minutes were audio and video recorded and transcribed verbatim alongside written field notes. Data were coded and analysed using inductive thematic analysis, involving researchers with topic and methodological expertise and input from a patient representative. RESULTS: Two themes emerged regarding current practice of using PROMs routine practice and personal evaluations. Four themes emerged as barriers to using PROMs for individuals with AIS: priority and support (e.g., HCPs focus on providing care), practical challenges (e.g., inadequate PROMs), patient-related challenges (e.g., patient preferences) and knowledge, education, and perceived value. Two themes emerged as facilitators: quality existing measure (e.g., sufficient psychometric properties), and priority and support (e.g., research department/culture). Themes for barriers to use performance measures were practicality (e.g., need physical space) and perceived value and knowledge (e.g., PROMs are more important), while the one theme for facilitators was practical consideration (e.g., acceptability). CONCLUSIONS: Although HCPs perceived the value of using outcome measures, current practice indicates limited use for individuals with AIS. The findings revealed different barriers and facilitators to implement PROMs in practice. Adopting performance measure are limited due to lack of knowledge and perceived value alongside the practicality, while considering practical factors can improve the use of these measures in practice.",2024,,PLoS One,19,1,e0297339,,10.1371/journal.pone.0297339,38277344,#454,Alamrani 2024,,,0
Clinical Trial Design Challenges and Opportunities for Emerging Treatments for Opioid Use Disorder: A Review.,Kiluk BD; Kleykamp BA; Comer SD; Griffiths RR; Huhn AS; Johnson MW; Kampman KM; Pravetoni M; Preston KL; Vandrey R; Bergeria CL; Bogenschutz MP; Brown RT; Dunn KE; Dworkin RH; Finan PH; Hendricks PS; Houtsmuller EJ; Kosten TR; Lee DC; Levin FR; McRae-Clark A; Raison CL; Rasmussen K; Turk DC; Weiss RD; Strain EC,"IMPORTANCE: Novel treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) are needed to address both the ongoing opioid epidemic and long-standing barriers to existing OUD treatments that target the endogenous μ-opioid receptor (MOR) system. The goal of this review is to highlight unique clinical trial design considerations for the study of emerging treatments for OUD that address targets beyond the MOR system. In November 2019, the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION) public-private partnership with the US Food and Drug Administration sponsored a meeting to discuss the current evidence regarding potential treatments for OUD, including cannabinoids, psychedelics, sedative-hypnotics, and immunotherapeutics, such as vaccines. OBSERVATIONS: Consensus recommendations are presented regarding the most critical elements of trial design for the evaluation of novel OUD treatments, such as: (1) stage of treatment that will be targeted (eg, seeking treatment, early abstinence/detoxification, long-term recovery); (2) role of treatment (adjunctive with or independent of existing OUD treatments); (3) primary outcomes informed by patient preferences that assess opioid use (including changes in patterns of use), treatment retention, and/or global functioning and quality of life; and (4) adverse events, including the potential for opioid-related relapse or overdose, especially if the patient is not simultaneously taking maintenance MOR agonist or antagonist medications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Applying the recommendations provided here as well as considering input from people with lived experience in the design phase will accelerate the development, translation, and uptake of effective and safe therapeutics for individuals struggling with OUD.",2023,Jan,JAMA Psychiatry,80,1,84-92,,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.4020,36449315,#1638,Kiluk 2023,,,0
Comparing Outcomes of a Discrete Choice Experiment and Case 2 Best-Worst Scaling: An Application to Neuromuscular Disease Treatment.,Soekhai V; Donkers B; Johansson JV; Jimenez-Moreno C; Pinto CA; de Wit GA; de Bekker-Grob E,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Case 2 best-worst scaling (BWS-2) is an increasingly popular method to elicit patient preferences. Because BWS-2 potentially has a lower cognitive burden compared with discrete choice experiments, the aim of this study was to compare treatment preference weights and relative importance scores. METHODS: Patients with neuromuscular diseases completed an online survey at two different moments in time, completing one method per occasion. Patients were randomly assigned to either first a discrete choice experiment or BWS-2. Attributes included: muscle strength, energy endurance, balance, cognition, chance of blurry vision, and chance of liver damage. Multinomial logit was used to calculate overall relative importance scores and latent class logit was used to estimate heterogeneous preference weights and to calculate the relative importance scores of the attributes for each latent class. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients were included for analyses. Overall relative importance scores showed differences in attribute importance rankings between a discrete choice experiment and BWS-2. Latent class analyses indicated three latent classes for both methods, with a specific class in both the discrete choice experiment and BWS-2 in which (avoiding) liver damage was the most important attribute. Ex-post analyses showed that classes differed in sex, age, level of education, and disease status. The discrete choice experiment was easier to understand compared with BWS-2. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that using a discrete choice experiment and BWS-2 leads to different outcomes, both in preference weights as well as in relative importance scores, which might have been caused by the different framing of risks in BWS-2. However, a latent class analysis revealed similar latent classes between methods. Careful consideration about method selection is required, while keeping the specific decision context in mind and pilot testing the methods.",2023,May,Patient,16,3,239-253,,10.1007/s40271-023-00615-0,36781628,#1285,Soekhai 2023,,,1
Development of a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure to assess patient perceptions of simplicity and complexity of treatment for type 2 diabetes.,Stewart KD; Matza LS; Patel H; Boye KS,"INTRODUCTION: Treatments for type 2 diabetes vary widely in their complexity. The simplicity or complexity of a treatment regimen may have an impact on patient preference, treatment adherence, and health outcomes. The purpose of this qualitative study was to develop two draft patient-reported outcome instruments focusing on patients' experience with simplicity and complexity of treatment for type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The instruments were developed in a series of steps: gather information to support development of a concept elicitation interview guide (literature review and expert interviews), concept elicitation interviews with patients (N = 30), cognitive interviews with patients (N = 20), and a translatability assessment. RESULTS: In concept elicitation interviews, patients with type 2 diabetes reported a range of treatment attributes that influence their perceptions of treatment simplicity and complexity, such as injection devices, medication preparation, dose timing, dose frequency, ease of taking the correct dose, flexibility of dose schedule, remembering to take medication, and food requirements. Two draft questionnaires were developed based on the literature review, expert interviews, and concept elicitation interviews with patients. Revisions were made to these draft instruments based on qualitative interviews with patients and translatability assessment. DISCUSSION: The qualitative research conducted in this study supports the content validity of two newly developed instruments, the Simplicity of Diabetes Treatment Questionnaire (Sim-Q) and the Simplicity of Diabetes Treatment Questionnaire-Comparison (Sim-Q-Comp), designed to assess the simplicity and complexity of diabetes treatment from the patient's perspective.",2023,Sep,J Patient Rep Outcomes,7,1,89,,10.1186/s41687-023-00614-7,37672123,#889,Stewart 2023,,,0
Research trends in contemporary health economics: a scientometric analysis on collective content of specialty journals.,Zwack CC; Haghani M; de Bekker-Grob EW,"INTRODUCTION: Health economics is a thriving sub-discipline of economics. Applied health economics research is considered essential in the health care sector and is used extensively by public policy makers. For scholars, it is important to understand the history and status of health economics-when it emerged, the rate of research output, trending topics, and its temporal evolution-to ensure clarity and direction when formulating research questions. METHODS: Nearly 13,000 articles were analysed, which were found in the collective publications of the ten most specialised health economic journals. We explored this literature using patterns of term co-occurrence and document co-citation. RESULTS: The research output in this field is growing exponentially. Five main research divisions were identified: (i) macroeconomic evaluation, (ii) microeconomic evaluation, (iii) measurement and valuation of outcomes, (iv) monitoring mechanisms (evaluation), and (v) guidance and appraisal. Document co-citation analysis revealed eighteen major research streams and identified variation in the magnitude of activities in each of the streams. A recent emergence of research activities in health economics was seen in the Medicaid Expansion stream. Established research streams that continue to show high levels of activity include Child Health, Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and Cost-effectiveness. Conversely, Patient Preference, Health Care Expenditure and Economic Evaluation are now past their peak of activity in specialised health economic journals. Analysis also identified several streams that emerged in the past but are no longer active. CONCLUSIONS: Health economics is a growing field, yet there is minimal evidence of creation of new research trends. Over the past 10 years, the average rate of annual increase in internationally collaborated publications is almost double that of domestic collaborations (8.4% vs 4.9%), but most of the top scholarly collaborations remain between six countries only.",2024,Jan,Health Econ Rev,14,1,6,,10.1186/s13561-023-00471-6,38270771,#456,Zwack 2024,,,0

Preferences of patients with chronic low back pain about nonsurgical treatments: Results of a discrete choice experiment.,Morillon GF; Benkhalti M; Dagenais P; Poder TG,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to assess patients' preferences of nonsurgical treatments for chronic low back pain (CLBP). METHOD: We conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) in Quebec, Canada, in 2018. Seven attributes were included: treatment modality, pain reduction, the onset of treatment efficacy, duration effectiveness, difficulties with daily activities, sleep problems, and knowledge of the patient's body and pain location. Treatment modalities were corticosteroid injections, supervised body-mind physical activities, supervised sports physical activities, physical manipulations, self-management courses, and psychotherapy. Utility levels were estimated using a logit model, a latent class model and a Bayesian hierarchical model. RESULTS: Analyses were conducted on 424 individuals. According to the Bayesian hierarchical model, the conditional relative importance weights of attributes were as follows: (1) treatment modality (34.79%), (2) pain reduction (18.73%), (3) difficulties with daily activities (11.71%), (4) duration effectiveness (10.06%), (5) sleep problems (10.05%), (6) onset of treatment efficacy (8.60%) and (7) knowledge of the patient's body and pain location (6.06%). According to the latent class model that found six classes of respondents with different behaviours (using Akaike and Bayesian criteria), the treatment modality was the most important attribute for all classes, except for class 4 for which pain reduction was the most important. In addition, classes 2 and 5 refused corticosteroid injections, while psychotherapy was preferred only in class 3. CONCLUSION: Given the preference heterogeneity found in the analysis, it is important that patient preferences are discussed and considered by the physicians. This will help to improve the patient care pathway in a context of a patient-centred model for a disease with growing prevalence. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: A small group of patients was involved in the conception, design and interpretation of data. Participants in the DCE were all CLBP patients.",2023,Feb,Health Expect,26,1,510-530,,10.1111/hex.13685,36482802,#1549,Morillon 2023,,,1
Colon Capsule Endoscopy - Shining the Light through the Colon.,Tai FWD; McAlindon M; Sidhu R,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) is a non-invasive, wireless capsule endoscope. In this article, we review its current applications, compare its performance with optical colonoscopy (OC) and alternative imaging modalities like CT colonography (CTC), and highlight developments that may increase potential future use. RECENT FINDINGS: By comparison to OC both CCE and CTC have a good sensitivity and specificity in detecting colonic polyps. CCE is more sensitive in detecting sub centimetre polyps. CCE is capable of detecting colonic inflammation and anorectal pathologies, commonly missed by CTC. However, rates of complete CCE examinations are limited by inadequate bowel preparation or incomplete colonic transit, whereas CTC can be performed with less bowel purgatives. Patients tolerate CCE better than OC, however patient preference between CCE and CTC vary. CCE and CTC are both reasonable alternatives to OC. Strategies to improve completion rates and adequacy of bowel preparation will improve cost and clinical effectiveness of CCE.",2023,May,Curr Gastroenterol Rep,25,5,99-105,,10.1007/s11894-023-00867-8,37022665,#1273,TaiFWD 2023,,,0
Perspectives of Patients and Professionals on Patient Education in Complex Endovascular Aortic Repair.,Warmerdam B; Oomen F; Hilt A; Melles M; Eefting D; Hamming J; van der Vorst J; van Schaik J,"BACKGROUND: Misinterpretation of patient preferences in perioperative education can lead to an undesired treatment decision. This explorative interview study presents differences in perspectives of patients and professionals on patient education in complex endovascular aortic aneurysm management. METHODS: Using convenience sampling, a cross-sectional interview study was performed among patients who were in various stages of the decision-making process for complex endovascular aortic repair. Five physicians were interviewed, representing the main providers of clinical information. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed inductively. RESULTS: Twelve patients (mean age 76.6 [standard deviation: 6.4], 83% male) were interviewed. Ten (83%) felt like they had no other realistic option besides undergoing surgery, whereas all professionals (5/5) stressed the importance of delicate patient selection. Five patients out of 10 (50%) who commented on their preferred decisional role considered the professional's advice as decisive. All but 1 patient (11/12) reported that the information was easy to understand, whereas 4 out of 5 professionals (80%) doubted whether patients could fully comprehend everything. Patients experienced a lack of information on the recovery process, although professionals stated that this was addressed during consultation. CONCLUSIONS: Several differences were found in the perspectives of patients and professionals on education in complex aortic aneurysm management. In order to optimize patient involvement in decision-making, professionals should be aware of these possible discrepancies and address them during consultation. Future research could focus on these differences in more detail by including more patients depending on their treatment and decision stages.",2024,Jan,Ann Vasc Surg,98,,87-101,,10.1016/j.avsg.2023.05.039,37355016,#533,Warmerdam 2024,,,0
Colorectal Cancer Screening and Surveillance in the Geriatric Population.,Cheong J; Faye A; Shaukat A,"PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Our national guidelines regarding screening and surveillance for colorectal cancer recommend individualized discussions with patients 75-85 years of age. This review explores the complex decision-making that surrounds these discussions. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite updated guidelines for colorectal cancer screening and surveillance, the guidance for patients 75 years of age or older remains unchanged. Studies exploring the risks to colonoscopy in this population, patient preferences, life expectancy calculators and additional studies in the subpopulation of inflammatory bowel disease patients provide points of consideration to aid in individualized discussions. The benefit-risk discussion for colorectal cancer screening in patients over 75 years old warrants further guidance to develop best practice.

"Objectivity, practicality, and significance of practice guidelines for the practicing neurologists: What we learnt from consensus criteria in CIDP, Myasthenia Gravis and Inflammatory Myopathies.",Dalakas MC,"The value of practice guidelines in the three most common autoimmune neuromuscular disorders, namely Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP), Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and Autoimmune Inflammatory Myopathies (AIM), has been extensively debated regarding their usefulness in clinical practice, objectivity and universal value considering that guidelines are also established regionally in certain countries. This commentary highlights common concerns on how guidelines are presently generated, pointing out: (a) non-sufficient diversity among Task-Force members to identify and address not only routine clinical and electrophysiology issues but also immunology, imaging, pathology, biomarkers, epidemiology or treatment economics; (b) Task-Force being often comprised by the same or seemingly like-minded members conveying the erroneous impression that experts with opposing views might have been excluded, even if this is clearly not the case; and (c) relying on web-based registries or retrospective data collections from heterogeneous sources. As a result, the existing practice guidelines in CIDP, MG and AIM remain an unfinished business but an excellent base for further enhancement. Guidelines can be extremely helpful not only for clinical trials but also in clinical practice if viewed as a living document with continuously updated versions by experts even with opposing views with precise information on diagnostics, pathomechanisms, therapeutic schemes, evolving biomarkers and economics of new therapies with validation of the post-guidelines criteria. Geographic diversity should be taken into consideration because the availability of biomarker testing, and therapies differ among countries. Patient preferences need to be also considered in therapeutic guidelines because newly marketed drugs offer more options steadily changing the therapeutic algorithms in autoimmune neuromuscular diseases generating also questions as to whether they also influence decisions on insurance coverage. Collectively, these startup considerations are aimed to make practice guidelines more objective, widely acceptable worldwide and more practical or easier to follow in clinical practice.",2023,,Ther Adv Neurol Disord,16,,17562864231194821,,10.1177/17562864231194821,37675039,#893,Dalakas 2023,,,0

The evidence clearly supports non-operative management of these injuries except for Achilles insertional tears and for certain patient groups, such as athletic patients, for whom further research is warranted. This nonadherence to evidence-based treatment may be explained by patient preference, surgeon subspecialty, surgeon era of practice or other variables.

Preferences for support in managing symptoms of an asthma flare-up: a pilot study of a discrete choice experiment.,O'Connell S; Queally M; Savage E; Murphy DM; Mc Carthy VJC,"Objective: Information on the preferences of people with asthma for support in managing a flare-up can inform service design which may facilitate appropriate help-seeking. To date, little is known about support preferences for managing a flare-up. The aim of this study was to develop and pilot a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit the preferences of people with asthma with regards to support in managing a flare-up.Methods: Steps in developing the DCE included identification and selection of attributes and levels of the support services, construction of choice tasks, experimental design, construction of DCE instrument, and pretest (n=16) and pilot (n=38) studies of the DCE instrument. A multinomial logit model was used to examine the strength and direction of the six attributes in the pilot study.Results: Our results indicate that from a patient perspective, having a healthcare professional that listens to their concerns was the most valued attribute of support in asthma flare-up management. The other features of support valued by participants were timely access to consultation, a healthcare professional with knowledge of their patient history, a specialist doctor and face-to-face communication. Having a written action plan was the least valued attribute.Conclusions: Our findings suggest patient preference for a model of support in managing their symptoms which includes timely, face-to-face access to a healthcare professional that knows them and listens to their concerns. The findings of the pilot study need to be verified with a larger sample and using models to account for preference heterogeneity.",2023,Feb,J Asthma,60,2,393-402,,10.1080/02770903.2022.2054429,35748303,#1573,O'Connell 2023,,,1
Materials and manufacturing techniques for occlusal splints: A literature review.,Nassif M; Haddad C; Habli L; Zoghby A,"OBJECTIVE: To review the materials and fabrications methods of occlusal splints with their advantages and shortcomings and to clarify the indications for each. BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) encompass a range of conditions affecting the masticatory system. Occlusal splints are currently recognised as a viable option for the management of TMDs when they are adopted in conjunction with additional approaches varying from conservative procedures (counselling, biofeedback, physical therapy, pharmacotherapy) to irreversible and less conservative ones (occlusal adjustments, orthodontics, arthroscopy and surgery). These splints can vary in design, function and material. The components used to fabricate the splints must withstand occlusal forces, be aesthetically pleasing, comfortable and minimally interfering with function and phonetics. Traditional methods for fabricating splints include sprinkle-on, thermoforming and lost wax techniques. However, with the advancement of CAD/CAM technology, additive (3D printing) and subtractive (milling) manufacturing methods expand the range of possibilities by introducing novel solutions for elaborating splints. METHODS: An electronic search was conducted on PubMed using the following keywords: ""occlusal splint"", ""guard and ""materials"", and ""manufacturing."" Thirteen in vitro publications were screened and they consisted of four clinical studies, nine reviews (three of them were systematic reviews), and five case reports. CONCLUSION: The choice of material is crucial for the success of splint therapy. Factors such as biocompatibility, ease of fabrication, adjustability, cost and patient preference should be considered. Newer materials and techniques are emerging because of advancements in material science and manufacturing techniques. However, it should be noted that most of the evidence is based on in vitro studies with different methodologies, limiting their validity in daily practice.",2023,Nov,J Oral Rehabil,50,11,1348-1354,,10.1111/joor.13550,37392157,#738,Nassif 2023,,,0
"""A disembodied voice over the telephone"": a qualitative study of healthcare practitioners' experiences in geriatric medicine.",Brown F; Sanders I; Watkins R; Grey E; Smith P; Springett D; Welsh T; Gillison F,"OBJECTIVES: This study explored the experience of delivering care remotely among practitioners in a UK geriatric medicine clinic. METHODS: Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with consultants (n = 5), nurses (n = 2), a speech and language and an occupational therapist, and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Four themes developed; Challenges of remote consultations; Perceived advantages of remote consultations; Disruption of involvement of family members; Impact on care staff. Participants felt that rapport and trust had been more feasible to develop remotely than they had anticipated, although this was more challenging for new patients and those with cognitive or sensory impairments. While practitioners identified advantages of remote consultations, including involving relatives, saving time, and reducing anxiety, they also experienced disadvantages such as consultations feeling like a 'production line', missing visual cues and reduced privacy. Some participants felt their professional identity was threatened by the lack of face-to-face contact, linked to feeling that remote consultations are not suitable for frail older adults or those with cognitive deficits. DISCUSSION: Staff perceived barriers to remote consultations that went beyond practical concerns, and suggest support for building rapport, involving families, and protecting clinician identity and job satisfaction may be warranted.",2023,May,BMC Geriatr,23,1,270,,10.1186/s12877-023-03909-y,37142989,#1249,Brown 2023,,,0
Patient Preferences of Breast Radiologists' Attire and Appearance.,Nguyen DL; Yoon SC; Baker JA; Destounis SV; Grimm LJ,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To assess patient preferences for breast radiologists' attire and appearance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multi-institutional anonymous, voluntary 19-question survey was administered to patients undergoing screening and diagnostic mammography examinations over a 5-week period. Using a 5-point Likert scale, respondents were asked about their preferences for gender-neutral attire (white coat), male-presenting attire (scrubs, dress shirt with tie, or dress shirt without tie), and female-presenting attire (scrubs, dress, blouse with pants, and blouse with skirt). Patient responses were compared to demographic data using bivariable analysis and multivariable regression. RESULTS: Response rate was 84.7% (957/1130). Mean respondent age was 57.2 years±11.9. Most respondents agreed/strongly agreed that the breast radiologist's appearance mattered (52.5%, 502/956) followed by being indifferent (28.1%, 269/956). Respondents with greater education levels felt less strongly (p=0.001) about the radiologist's appearance: 63.3% (70/110) less than college cared about appearance compared to 53.5% (266/497) college/vocational and 47.4% (165/348) graduate. Most respondents felt indifferent about a breast radiologist wearing a white coat (68.9%, 657/954) or about male-presenting breast radiologists wearing a tie (77.1%, 734/952) without significant demographic differences. Almost all respondents either prefer/strongly prefer (60.1%, 572/951) or were indifferent (39.6%, 377/951) to all breast radiologists wearing scrubs when performing procedures. While respondents approved of all attire choices overall, most respondents preferred scrubs for both male- and female-presenting breast radiologists (64.0%, 612/957 and 64.9%, 621/957, respectively). CONCLUSION: A variety of breast radiologists' attire can be worn while maintaining provider professionalism and without compromising patient expectations.",2023,Oct,Acad Radiol,,,,,10.1016/j.acra.2023.10.012,37914625,#758,Nguyen 2023,,,0
Approach to Obesity Treatment in Primary Care: A Review.,Yanovski SZ; Yanovski JA,"IMPORTANCE: More than 40% of US adults have obesity, which increases the risks for multiple chronic diseases and premature mortality. Historically, nonsurgical interventions often have not led to sufficient weight loss and maintenance to improve health, but highly effective antiobesity medications (AOMs) have recently become available, and additional effective therapeutics are under development. Given that most medical care for adults with obesity is delivered in primary care settings, guidance for integrating weight-management approaches is needed. OBSERVATIONS: Lifestyle interventions can lead to a mean weight loss of 2% to 9% of initial weight at 1 year and increase the likelihood of weight loss of 5% or more, but weight regain over time is common even with continued treatment. Adjunctive treatments, including AOMs and surgical approaches, can lead to larger, more sustained weight loss and improvements in numerous obesity-associated medical conditions. Highly effective AOMs, including nutrient-stimulated hormone-based therapies, induce mean weight loss of 15% or more. Barriers to intervention, including access to care, have a disproportionate influence on populations most affected by obesity and its consequences. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Primary care clinicians play a vital role in the assessment, management, and support of patients with obesity. With careful clinical assessment and shared decision-making, a flexible treatment plan can be developed that reflects evidence of treatment efficacy, patient preference, and feasibility of implementation. Adjunctive therapies to lifestyle interventions, including more effective pharmacotherapeutics for obesity, offer hope to patients and the potential for considerable improvements in health and quality of life.",2024,Mar,JAMA Intern Med,,,,,10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.8526,38466272,#249,Yanovski 2024,,,0
Monoclonal antibody or aspirin desensitization in NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD)?,Van Broeck D; Steelant B; Scadding G; Hellings PW,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by nasal polyposis, asthma, and intolerance to aspirin/NSAID. It affects approximately 15% cases of severe asthma, 10% of nasal polyps and 9% of rhinosinusitis. N-ERD results in associated asthma exacerbations, oral corticosteroids bursts, corticosteroid-dependent disease, and multiple endoscopic sinus surgeries. Unknown influences cause polyp epithelium to release alarmins, such as IL-33 and TSLP. These cytokines activate lymphoid cells, both Th2 and ILC2, to release cytokines such as IL5, IL4 and IL13, resulting in complex type 2 inflammation involving mast cells, eosinophils and platelets. Arachidonic acid released from such cells is metabolized into mediators. N-ERD is characterized by an imbalance in eicosanoid levels, especially CysLTs, PDG and PGE2. Patients with N-ERD present nasal symptoms (congestion, hyposmia/anosmia, nasal discharge) and lower airways symptoms (cough, sneezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness), anosmia, severe hyposmia as well as severe asthma which impacts the quality of life in this disease and leads to safety concerns in patients daily lives. Despite the variety of treatment strategies, the likelihood of recurrence of symptoms is high in patients with N-ERD. The most important strategies for treating N-ERD are listed as following: drug therapies, aspirin desensitization, monoclonal antibodies and other therapies associated. N-ERD treatment remains a major challenge in the current situation. Selecting the appropriate patient for aspirin desensitization, monoclonal antibodies or both is essential. This review provides an overview on aspirin desensitization and biologics in N-ERD and might help in decision making from both the perspective of the physician and patient. Patient characteristics, safety, efficacy, health care costs, but also patient preferences are all factors to take into account when it comes to a choice between biologics or aspirin desensitization.",2023,,Front Allergy,4,,1080951,,10.3389/falgy.2023.1080951,37123562,#1326,VanBroeck 2023,,,0
A practical proposal on treatment sequencing of metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours.,Perrier M; Scoazec JY; Walter T,"According to the neuroendocrine tumour (NET) characteristics, 3 to 7 different treatment options are available, corresponding to 6 to 5,040 theoretical different sequences. Even though each patient is unique and despite a large heterogeneity in NET characteristics, the present review aims to discuss the main sequences and addresses how one can propose the best sequence to treat metastatic NET (mNET) on a case-by-case basis. Each treatment must be discussed during dedicated multi-disciplinary meetings, and inclusions in clinical trials should be favoured. After a thorough characterization of patients and their mNET, and taking into account the availability of drugs, the first-line treatment should be chosen according to the treatment aim. The latter is determined based on three main topics (efficacy, safety, and patient preferences) that do not necessarily converge and must be defined a priori. At baseline, physicians should design an a priori full therapeutic sequence, which may evolve at each step depending on the response to previous treatment, the occurrence of chronic toxicities, and the patients' perception of the prior treatment. To improve knowledge in terms of effectiveness and risk of cumulative toxicities regarding the different sequences, real-world data using long follow-up durations are necessary; such issues will not be resolved by randomized clinical trials.",2023,,Ther Adv Med Oncol,15,,17588359231171041,,10.1177/17588359231171041,37152421,#1307,Perrier 2023,,,0

Treatment patterns and healthcare costs among patients with psoriasis initiating apremilast or biologics: a retrospective claims database cohort analysis.,Wu JJ; Wang CA; Jobson G; Davidson D; Kalirai S; Zhu J; Suryavanshi M; Mittal M; Patel V; Seigel L,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare treatment patterns and healthcare costs for patients with psoriasis who initiate apremilast, tumor necrosis factor inhibitor, or interleukin inhibitor. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used Optum Clinformatics(®) Data Mart to identify propensity score-matched patients initiating apremilast, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, or interleukin inhibitors, with 12-month baseline and 24-month follow-up data. Switch, discontinuation, persistence, healthcare resource utilization, and total healthcare costs were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-four-month switch rates were highest for tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (32%), followed by apremilast (21%) then interleukin inhibitors (14%). Mean (SD) per-patient-per-month costs for switchers were lowest for apremilast ($4213 [$2304]), higher for tumor necrosis factor inhibitors ($5274 [$2280]), and highest for interleukin inhibitors ($5539 [$2296]; p < .001), primarily attributable to pharmacy costs: $3466 (apremilast), $4432 (tumor necrosis factor inhibitor), and $4721 (interleukin inhibitor). LIMITATIONS: Psoriasis severity is absent from claims data; cost outcomes may be influenced by more severe psoriasis being more costly. CONCLUSION: Switching psoriasis treatment is common and increases over time. Apremilast initiators had lower switch rates and costs compared with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, despite lower effectiveness reported in previous studies, perhaps indicating patient preference for oral treatment.

A Narrative Review of Advancements in Understanding and Treating Varicose Veins.,Singh A; Gattani R,"Chronic venous disease, with varicose veins as its archetypal manifestation, stands as a pervasive and intricate health quandary, encompassing a vast array of contributing factors. Age, genetics, obesity, pregnancy, and prolonged immobility weave a complex tapestry, underscoring the omnipresence of this ailment. Its societal and economic footprint is undeniably formidable, as diverse classifications underscore its multifaceted character. The intricate interplay of chronic venous disease with diabetes mellitus and neuropathy compounds the challenge, fostering soaring healthcare expenditures and a palpable erosion of quality of life, particularly among women harboring cardiometabolic risk factors. Despite research shedding light on heightened susceptibility within certain demographics, the enigmatic determinants orchestrating the transition from mild to severe chronic venous disease continue to elude us. Varicose veins, marked by the presence of dilated and tortuous subcutaneous vessels, precipitate both physical discomfort and cosmetic concerns, frequently necessitating meticulous clinical evaluation coupled with ultrasound studies to secure a precise diagnosis. Treatment strategies are strategically crafted to ameliorate distressing symptoms, enhance aesthetic concerns, and forestall potential complications. Nevertheless, the prognostication of chronic venous disease remains ensconced in a degree of ambiguity, hinting at the vast terrain yet to be charted in this medical domain. The quest to fathom the intricacies of this condition uncovers an ever-evolving panorama where conservative interventions play an indispensable role in managing mild cases, while interventional procedures like endovenous laser ablation and sclerotherapy step onto the stage for patients grappling with severe symptoms, thus treading the fine line between efficacy and invasiveness. Moreover, a meticulous economic analysis underscores the cost-effectiveness of various therapeutic modalities, thereby bolstering the imperative of a patient-centered approach. As we navigate the labyrinthine complexities of chronic venous disease and varicose vein management, we are inexorably drawn to the pivotal role of customized treatment approaches, as well as the dynamic interplay between scientific progress, patient preferences, and therapeutic innovations in the relentless pursuit of optimized outcomes and an enhanced quality of life.",2023,Nov,Cureus,15,11,e48093,,10.7759/cureus.48093,38046781,#703,Singh 2023,,,0
A Discrete Choice Experiment to Assess Patient Preferences for Asthma Rescue Therapy and Disease Management.,Israel E; Farooqui N; Gillette C; Gilbert I; Gandhi H; Tervonen T; Balantac Z; Thomas C; Krucien N; George M,"BACKGROUND: With the expanding treatment landscape for asthma, the process of identifying best-fit, individualized management options is becoming increasingly complicated. Understanding patients' preferences can inform shared decision-making between clinicians and patients. OBJECTIVES: To examine preferences of adults with asthma for therapeutic and management attributes and determine how these preferences vary among patients. METHODS: We conducted an online discrete choice experiment survey in US adults with asthma. Patient preferences were analyzed using logit models. Factors affecting patients' preferences were identified by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,184 patients completed the survey (60% female; mean [SD] age, 49.2 [15.0] years). Patients most valued fewer asthma attacks requiring urgent health care professional visits, fewer exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids, and a reduced risk for oral thrush. Higher value was placed on reducing the risk of short-term (oral thrush) versus long-term side effects (diabetes). Patients were willing to increase rescue medication use in exchange for decreasing exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and attacks requiring urgent health care professional visits. Patients preferred a single inhaler for rescue and maintenance and least valued asthma action plans. Demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors affected patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: Patients sought convenient management options that focused mainly on decreasing the short-term morbidity associated with asthma exacerbations and therapies. Preferences varied by demographics, clinical factors, and socioeconomics. It is important for shared decision-making discussions to include conversations about morbidity and how available therapeutic options align with individual patient preferences.",2023,Sep,J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,11,9,2781-2791.e4,,10.1016/j.jaip.2023.04.046,37182565,#939,Israel 2023,,,1
It takes more than a machine: A pilot feasibility study of point-of-care HIV-1 viral load testing at a lower-level health center in rural western Uganda.,Boyce RM; Ndizeye R; Ngelese H; Baguma E; Shem B; Rubinstein RJ; Rockwell E; Lotspeich SC; Shook-Sa BE; Ntaro M; Nyehangane D; Wohl DA; Siedner MJ; Mulogo EM,"Barriers continue to limit access to viral load (VL) monitoring across sub-Saharan Africa adversely impacting control of the HIV epidemic. The objective of this study was to determine whether the systems and processes required to realize the potential of rapid molecular technology are available at a prototypical lower-level (i.e., level III) health center in rural Uganda. In this open-label pilot study, participants underwent parallel VL testing at both the central laboratory (i.e., standard of care) and on-site using the GeneXpert HIV-1 assay. The primary outcome was the number of VL tests completed each clinic day. Secondary outcomes included the number of days from sample collection to receipt of result at clinic and the number of days from sample collection to patient receipt of the result. From August 2020 to July 2021, we enrolled a total of 242 participants. The median number of daily tests performed on the Xpert platform was 4, (IQR = 2-7). Time from sample collection to result was 51 days (IQR = 45-62) for samples sent to the central laboratory and 0 days (IQR = 0-0.25) for the Xpert assay conducted at the health center. However, few participants elected to receive results by one of the expedited options, which contributed to similar time-to-patient between testing approaches (89 versus 84 days, p = 0.07). Implementation of a rapid, near point-of-care VL assay at a lower-level health center in rural Uganda appears feasible, but interventions to promote rapid clinical response and influence patient preferences about result receipt require further study.

Psoriasis: a focus on upcoming oral formulations.,Rusiñol L; Carmona-Rocha E; Puig L,"INTRODUCTION: Targeted therapies have greatly improved the quality of life of patients with psoriasis. Despite the extensive list of treatments available, multiple new drugs are being developed, especially oral therapies with potential advantages as regards comfort of administration. However, the efficacy and safety of these new oral therapies need to be improved to match those of novel biologics. AREAS COVERED: We provide a narrative review of the oral therapies for psoriasis that are currently under development, from Jak inhibitors to oral IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors, among others. A literature search was performed for articles published from 1 January 2020, to 6 June 2023. EXPERT OPINION: The approval of deucravacitinib, the first Jak inhibitor for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, heralds a bright therapeutic future with multiple new oral formulations. A great number of oral treatments with singular mechanism of action, like A3AR agonists, HSP90 inhibitors, ROCK-2 inhibitors, oral TNF inhibitors, oral IL-23 inhibitors, oral IL-17 inhibitors, PD4 inhibitors (orismilast) and several Tyk2 inhibitors, are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and could be suitable for approval in the future.

Preferred Conversation Topics with Respect to Treatment Decisions Among Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.,Tichler A; Hertroijs DFL; Ruwaard D; Brouwers MCGJ; Hiligsmann M; de Jong JD; Elissen AMJ,"PURPOSE: Greater knowledge of individuals' needs and preferences can enhance shared decision-making, which is associated with improved quality of decisions and increased satisfaction. This study aimed to identify and prioritize the attributes (ie conversation topics) that individuals with type 2 diabetes find it most important to discuss with their healthcare provider regarding treatment decisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: First, small group interviews were organized with adults with type 2 diabetes (N=8) treated in primary care to identify the attributes that they find important to discuss regarding treatment decisions. A five-step nominal group technique was applied during the interviews. An object best-worst scaling (BWS) survey was subsequently distributed to individuals with self-reported diabetes participating in the Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel of the Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (N=600) to determine the relative importance score (RIS) of the identified attributes. A higher RIS indicates a higher level of perceived importance. Subgroup and latent class analyses were performed to explore whether individuals' demographic and disease characteristics influenced their attribute preferences. RESULTS: A total of 21 attributes were identified during three small group interviews with individuals with type 2 diabetes. Respondents in the BWS survey (N=285) viewed ""quality of life"" (RIS=11.97), ""clinical outcomes"" (RIS=10.40), ""long-term diabetes complications"" (RIS=9.83) and ""short-term adverse medication"" (RIS=7.72) as the most important in the decision-making process for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Some differences in attribute preferences were identified according to demographic and disease characteristics. CONCLUSION: In general, individuals with type 2 diabetes not only want to discuss the biological effects of treatments, but also the impact of treatment on their quality of life. Healthcare providers should be aware that attributes are viewed differently by different individuals. This emphasizes the need for tailor-made healthcare decisions, which means eliciting and responding to individual preferences in the decision-making process.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,719-729,,10.2147/PPA.S397647,36960182,#1408,Tichler 2023,,,1
"Can the General Public Be a Proxy for an ""At-Risk"" Group in a Patient Preference Study? A Disease Prevention Example in Rheumatoid Arthritis.",DiSantostefano RL; Simons G; Englbrecht M; Humphreys JH; Bruce IN; Bywall KS; Radawski C; Raza K; Falahee M; Veldwijk J,"BACKGROUND: When selecting samples for patient preference studies, it may be difficult or impractical to recruit participants who are eligible for a particular treatment decision. However, a general public sample may not be an appropriate proxy. OBJECTIVE: This study compares preferences for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) preventive treatments between members of the general public and first-degree relatives (FDRs) of confirmed RA patients to assess whether a sample of the general public can be used as a proxy for FDRs. METHODS: Participants were asked to imagine they were experiencing arthralgia and had screening tests indicating a 60% chance of developing RA within 2 yrs. Using a discrete choice experiment, participants were offered a series of choices between no treatment and 2 unlabeled hypothetical treatments to reduce the risk of RA. To assess data quality, time to complete survey sections and comprehension questions were assessed. A random parameter logit model was used to obtain attribute-level estimates, which were used to calculate relative importance, maximum acceptable risk (MAR), and market shares of hypothetical preventive treatments. RESULTS: The FDR sample (n = 298) spent more time completing the survey and performed better on comprehension questions compared with the general public sample (n = 982). The relative importance ranking was similar between the general public and FDR participant samples; however, other relative preference measures involving weights including MARs and market share differed between groups, with FDRs having numerically higher MARs. CONCLUSION: In the context of RA prevention, the general public (average risk) may be a reasonable proxy for a more at-risk sample (FDRs) for overall relative importance ranking but not weights. The rationale for a proxy sample should be clearly justified. HIGHLIGHTS: Participants from the general public were compared to first-degree relatives on their preferences for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) preventive treatments using a discrete choice experiment.Preferences were similar between groups in terms of the most important and least important attributes of preventive treatments, with effectiveness being the most important attribute. However, relative weights differed.Attention to the survey and predicted market shares of hypothetical RA preventive treatments differed between the general public and first-degree relatives.The general public may be a reasonable proxy for an at-risk group for patient preferences ranks but not weights in the disease prevention context; however, care should be taken in sample selection for patient preference studies when choosing nonpatients.",2024,Feb,Med Decis Making,44,2,189-202,,10.1177/0272989X231218265,38240281,#410,DiSantostefano 2024,,,1
"Family Members' Engagement in Symptom Communication, Assessment, and Management in the Intensive Care Unit: A Qualitative Study.",Nyhagen R; Egerod I; Rustøen T; Lerdal A; Kirkevold M,"BACKGROUND: Opportunities for communication and participation in decision making are limited for critically ill patients, but family members serving as surrogates enable empowerment of these patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore family members' engagement in symptom communication in the intensive care unit. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design using fieldwork methodology with triangulation of participant observation and individual interviews was conducted. Nine mechanically ventilated patients were observed in interaction with family members and clinicians in the intensive care unit. Six of the observed patients, 6 family members, and 9 clinicians were interviewed after participant observation. Field notes and transcripts were analyzed using Braun and Clarke's method of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Family members engaged actively in symptom communication, assessment, and management, and there were barriers and facilitators to family engagement. Three main themes and 9 subthemes describing family engagement emerged: (1) intermediary role (recognize and report symptoms, provide patient information, and assist in communication), (2) independent role (provide familiarity, manage symptoms, and promote patient communication), and (3) conditions for family engagement (intensive care unit environment, relationship with the patient, and patient preferences).

Antidepressants or running therapy: Comparing effects on mental and physical health in patients with depression and anxiety disorders.,Verhoeven JE; Han LKM; Lever-van Milligen BA; Hu MX; Révész D; Hoogendoorn AW; Batelaan NM; van Schaik DJF; van Balkom AJLM; van Oppen P; Penninx BWJH,"BACKGROUND: Antidepressant medication and running therapy are both effective treatments for patients with depressive and anxiety disorders. However, they may work through different pathophysiological mechanisms and could differ in their impact on physical health. This study examined effects of antidepressants versus running therapy on both mental and physical health. METHODS: According to a partially randomized patient preference design, 141 patients with depression and/or anxiety disorder were randomized or offered preferred 16-week treatment: antidepressant medication (escitalopram or sertraline) or group-based running therapy ≥2 per week. Baseline (T0) and post-treatment assessment at week 16 (T16) included mental (diagnosis status and symptom severity) and physical health indicators (metabolic and immune indicators, heart rate (variability), weight, lung function, hand grip strength, fitness). RESULTS: Of the 141 participants (mean age 38.2 years; 58.2 % female), 45 participants received antidepressant medication and 96 underwent running therapy. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that remission rates at T16 were comparable (antidepressants: 44.8 %; running: 43.3 %; p = .881). However, the groups differed significantly on various changes in physical health: weight (d = 0.57; p = .001), waist circumference (d = 0.44; p = .011), systolic (d = 0.45; p = .011) and diastolic (d = 0.53; p = .002) blood pressure, heart rate (d = 0.36; p = .033) and heart rate variability (d = 0.48; p = .006). LIMITATIONS: A minority of the participants was willing to be randomized; the running therapy was larger due to greater preference for this intervention. CONCLUSIONS: While the interventions had comparable effects on mental health, running therapy outperformed antidepressants on physical health, due to both larger improvements in the running therapy group as well as larger deterioration in the antidepressant group.

Perceptions of shared decision making in gastroenterology and inflammatory bowel disease: A qualitative analysis.,Blum L; Jarach CM; Ellen ME,"OBJECTIVE: Shared decision-making (SDM) is the partnership and discussion between clinicians and patients to make an appropriate decision based on scientific evidence and patient preferences. Many benefits are associated with SDM; however, little is known about its awareness or use by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) clinicians in gastroenterology departments across Israel. This study aims to identify barriers and facilitators in implementing SDM as standard practice to achieve optimal disease management and personalized care for patients with IBD. METHODS: Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with IBD clinicians across Israel to identify the barriers and facilitators for SDM use. An interview guide was developed, based on the systematic approach of the Theoretical Domain Framework (TDF). Interview transcripts were coded into theoretical domains to identify factors that may impact SDM. RESULTS: Sixteen gastroenterologists from nine different hospitals were interviewed. Common TDF domains that presented as barriers were: knowledge, skills, social/professional role and identity, environmental context and resources, and reinforcement. Most participants had never heard the precise term ""shared decision making"" and lacked formal training on SDM. CONCLUSION: This study identified key barriers and facilitators to SDM in IBD clinics across Israel. Main barriers of SDM include limited or nonexistent training; clinicians were unaware of SDM guidelines or techniques. The main facilitators of SDM were clinicians' social and professional role and identity and their beliefs about the influence of IBD and/or CD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: These influencing factors and TDF domains identified provide a basis for developing future interventions to improve the implementation of SDM within IBD management.",2023,Oct,Patient Educ Couns,115,,107877,,10.1016/j.pec.2023.107877,37437510,#827,Blum 2023,,,0
ACTivity as medicine In Oncology for Head and Neck (ACTIOHN): Protocol for a feasibility study investigating a patient-centred approach to exercise for people with head and neck cancer.,Midgley AW; Levy AR; Rogers SN; Brooker RC; Bryant V; Cherry MG; Lane S; Nugent MM; Price R; Schache AG; Young B; Patterson JM,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Attempts at personalisation of exercise programmes in head and neck cancer (HaNC) have been limited. The main aim of the present study is to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of introducing a remotely delivered, fully personalised, collaborative, and flexible approach to prescribing and delivering exercise programmes into the HaNC usual care pathway. METHODS: This is a single arm, feasibility study. Seventy patients diagnosed with HaNC will be recruited from two regional HaNC centres in the United Kingdom. Patients will undertake an 8-week exercise programme designed and delivered by cancer exercise specialists. The exercise programme will start any time between the time of diagnosis and up to 8 weeks after completing treatment, depending on patient preference. The content of the exercise programme will be primarily based on patient needs, preferences, and goals, but guided by current physical activity guidelines for people with cancer. The primary outcome measure is retention to the study. Secondary quantitative outcomes are uptake to the exercise programme, different measures of exercise adherence, pre- and post-intervention assessments of fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form), quality of life (SF-36), physical activity levels (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form), and various components of physical fitness. The outcomes of the nested qualitative study are acceptability and feasibility of the intervention evaluated via interviews with patients, health care professionals, and the cancer exercise specialists. Intervention and participant fidelity will be determined using checklists and scrutiny of each patient's logbook and the cancer exercise specialists' meeting notes. Analysis of quantitative data will be via standard summary statistics. Qualitative data will be analysed using thematic analysis. EXPECTED RESULTS: This feasibility study will inform the design and conduct of a future randomised controlled trial. Success will be defined according to a traffic light system for identifying the appropriateness of progression to a randomised controlled trial.

Decision aids for patients with carotid stenosis.,Krafcik BM; Jarmel IA; Beach JM; Suckow BD; Stableford JA; Stone DH; Goodney PP; Columbo JA,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making tools have been underused by clinicians in real-world practice. Changes to the National Coverage Determination by Medicare for carotid stenting greatly expand the coverage for patients, but simultaneously require a shared decision-making interaction that involves the use of a validated tool. Accordingly, our objective was to evaluate the currently available decision aids for carotid stenosis. METHODS: We conducted a review of the literature for published work on decision aids for the treatment of carotid disease. RESULTS: Four publications met inclusion criteria. We found the format of the decision aid impacted patient comprehension and decision making, although patient characteristics also played a role in the therapeutic decisions made. Notably, none of the available decision aids included the widely adopted transcarotid artery revascularization as an option. CONCLUSIONS: Further work is needed in the development of a widespread validated decision aid instrument for patients with carotid stenosis.",2024,Mar,J Vasc Surg,79,3,704-707,,10.1016/j.jvs.2023.10.050,37923023,#313,Krafcik 2024,,,0
A Discrete Choice Analysis Comparing COVID-19 Vaccination Decisions for Children and Adults.,Prosser LA; Wagner AL; Wittenberg E; Zikmund-Fisher BJ; Rose AM; Pike J,"IMPORTANCE: COVID-19 vaccination rates in the US remain below optimal levels. Patient preferences for different attributes of vaccine products and the vaccination experience can be important in determining vaccine uptake decisions. OBJECTIVE: To assess preferences for attributes of adult and pediatric COVID-19 vaccination among US adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An online survey of a national panel of 1040 US adults was conducted in May and June 2021. A discrete choice analysis was used to measure the relative value of each attribute in the decision to choose a COVID-19 vaccination option for adults or children. Six attributes were used to described hypothetical vaccination options: vaccine effectiveness, mild side effects, rare adverse events, number of doses, time required for vaccination, and regulatory approval. Respondents chose between hypothetical vaccination profiles or no vaccination. Additional survey questions asked about vaccination beliefs, COVID-19 illness experience, COVID-19 risk factors, vaccination status, and opinions about the risk of COVID-19. EXPOSURES: Respondents chose which vaccine profile they would prefer to receive for themselves (or no vaccination). Respondents then considered an identical set of profiles for a hypothetical child aged 0 to 17 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Relative value of vaccination-related attributes were estimated using Bayesian logit regression. Preference profiles for subgroups were estimated using latent class analyses. RESULTS: A total of 1040 adults (610 [59%] female; 379 participants [36%] with an age of 55 years and older years) responded to the survey. When asked about vaccination choices for themselves, participants indicated that vaccine effectiveness (95% vs 60%) was a significant attribute (β, 9.59 [95% CrI, 9.20-10.00] vs β, 0.41 [95% CrI, 0-0.80]). Respondents also preferred fewer rare adverse events (β, 6.35 [95% CrI, 5.74-6.86), fewer mild side effects (β, 5.49; 95% CrI, 5.12-5.87), 1 dose (β, 5.41; 95% CrI, 5.04-5.78), FDA approval (β, 6.01; 95% CrI, 5.64-6.41), and shorter waiting times (β, 5.67; 95% CrI, 4.87-6.48). Results were very similar when framing the question as adult or child vaccination, with slightly stronger preference for fewer rare adverse events for children. Latent class analysis revealed 4 groups of respondents: (1) individuals sensitive to safety and regulatory status, (2) individuals sensitive to convenience, (3) individuals who carefully considered all attributes in making their choices, and (4) individuals who rejected the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of US adults, the identification of 4 distinct preference groups provides new information to guide communications to support vaccine decision making. In particular, the group that prioritize convenience (less time required for vaccination and fewer doses) may present an opportunity to create actionable strategies to increase vaccination uptake for both adult and pediatric populations.",2023,Jan,JAMA Netw Open,6,1,e2253582,,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.53582,36716030,#1603,Prosser 2023,,,1

"Person-centered strategies for delivering TB diagnostic services in Lima, Peru.",Yuen CM; Millones AK; Acosta D; Torres I; Farroñay S; Jimenez J; Lecca L,"SETTING: Lima, Peru. OBJECTIVE: To close the gap in TB diagnosis, TB diagnostic services must match care-seeking preferences. We sought to identify preferred strategies for delivering TB diagnostic services and to determine whether preferences differ among demographic groups. DESIGN: During May 2022-January 2023, we recruited adults who recently initiated treatment for pulmonary TB. We used an object-case best-worst scaling instrument to assess the desirability of nine hypothetical strategies for delivering TB diagnostic services. A t-test was used to assess differences in preference scores between groups. RESULTS: Among 150 participants, the strategies with the highest preference scores were an integrated mobile unit offering screening for multiple conditions, expedited attention at the health center, and home-based screening. These were strongly preferred by 42%, 25%, and 27% of participants, respectively, and 80% of participants strongly preferred at least one of the three. Expedited attention at the health center scored more highly among people who experienced >2 months delay in TB diagnosis compared to those who experienced a more rapid diagnosis (0.37 ± 0.06 vs. 0.17 ± 0.06; P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: Providing person-centered TB diagnostic services at diverse access points could help reach different populations, which could promote early diagnosis and help close the diagnosis gap.",2023,Sep,Public Health Action,13,3,112-116,,10.5588/pha.23.0036,37736576,#864,Yuen 2023,,,1
A multi- and mixed-method adaptation study of a patient-centered perioperative mental health intervention bundle.,Abraham J; Meng A; Baumann A; Holzer KJ; Lenard E; Freedland KE; Lenze EJ; Avidan MS; Politi MC,"BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression are common among older adults and can intensify during perioperative periods, but few mental health interventions are designed for older surgical patients' unique needs. As part of the feasibility trial, we developed and adapted a perioperative mental health (PMH) bundle for older patients comprised of behavioral activation (BA) and medication optimization (MO) to ameliorate anxiety and depressive symptoms before, during, and after cardiac, orthopedic, and oncologic surgery. METHODS: We used mixed-methods including workshop studios with patients, caregivers, clinicians, researchers, and interventionists; intervention refinement and reflection meetings; patient case review meetings; intervention session audio-recordings and documentation forms; and patient and caregiver semi-structured interviews. We used the results to refine our PMH bundle. We used multiple analytical approaches to report the nature of adaptations, including hybrid thematic analysis and content analysis informed by the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications - Expanded. RESULTS: Adaptations were categorized by content (intervention components), context (how the intervention is delivered, based on the study, target population, intervention format, intervention delivery mode, study setting, study personnel), training, and evaluation. Of 51 adaptations, 43.1% involved content, 41.2% involved context, and 15.7% involved training and evaluation. Several key adaptations were noted: (1) Intervention content was tailored to patient preferences and needs (e.g., rewording elements to prevent stigmatization of mental health needs; adjusting BA techniques and documentation forms to improve patient buy-in and motivation). (2) Cohort-specific adaptations were recommended based on differing patient needs. (3) Compassion was identified by patients as the most important element. CONCLUSIONS: We identified evidence-based mental health intervention components from other settings and adapted them to the perioperative setting for older adults. Informed by mixed-methods, we created an innovative and pragmatic patient-centered intervention bundle that is acceptable, feasible, and responsive to the needs of older surgical populations. This approach allowed us to identify implementation strategies to improve the reach, scalability, and sustainability of our bundle, and can guide future patient-centered intervention adaptations.

Changing patient preferences toward better trial recruitment: an ethical analysis.,Al P; Hey S; Weijer C; Gillies K; McCleary N; Yee ML; Inglis J; Presseau J; Brehaut J,"While randomized controlled trials are essential to health research, many of these trials fail to recruit enough participants. Approaching recruitment through the lens of behavioral science can help trialists to understand influences on the decision to participate and use them to increase recruitment. Although this approach is promising, the use of behavioral influences during recruitment is in tension with the ethical principle of respect for persons, as at least some of these influences could be used to manipulate potential participants. In this paper, we examine this tension by discussing two types of behavioral influences: one example involves physician recommendations, and the other involves framing of information to exploit cognitive biases. We argue that despite the apparent tension with ethical principles, influencing trial participants through behavior change strategies can be ethically acceptable. However, we argue that trialists have a positive obligation to analyze their recruitment strategies for behavioral influences and disclose these upfront to the research ethics committee. But we also acknowledge that since neither trialists nor ethics committees are presently well equipped to perform these analyses, additional resources and guidance are needed. We close by outlining a path toward the development of such guidance.",2023,Mar,Trials,24,1,233,,10.1186/s13063-023-07258-4,36973759,#1398,Al 2023,,,0
Exercise behaviours and motivation after a first psychotic episode: A digital intervention.,Ruiz-Yu B; Le TP; Ventura J; Arevian A; Hellemann GS; Nuechterlein KH,"AIM: Research has demonstrated that participation in aerobic exercise can have significant beneficial effects across both physical and mental health domains for individuals who are in the early phase of schizophrenia. Despite these notable benefits of exercise, deficits in motivation and a lack of methods to increase engagement are significant barriers for exercise participation, limiting these potentially positive effects. Fortunately, digital health tools have the potential to improve adherence to an exercise program. The present study examined the role of motivation for exercise and the effects of an automated digital text messaging program on participation in an aerobic exercise program. METHODS: A total of 46 first-episode psychosis participants from an ongoing 12-month randomized clinical trial (Enhancing Cognitive Training through Exercise Following a First Schizophrenia Episode (CT&E-RCT)) were included in an analysis to examine the efficacy of motivational text messaging. Personalized motivational text message reminders were sent to participants with the aim of increasing engagement in the exercise program. RESULTS: We found that participants with higher levels of intrinsic motivation to participate in a text messaging program and in an exercise intervention completed a higher proportion of individual, at-home exercise sessions. In a between groups analysis, participants who received motivational text messages, compared to those who did not, completed a higher proportion of at-home exercise sessions. CONCLUSION: These results indicate the importance of considering a person's level of motivation for exercise and the potential utility of using individualized and interactive mobile text messaging reminders to increase engagement in aerobic exercise in the early phase of psychosis. We emphasize the need for understanding how individualized patient preferences and needs interplay between intrinsic motivation and digital health interventions for young adults.",2024,Feb,Early Interv Psychiatry,,,,,10.1111/eip.13518,38356325,#370,Ruiz-Yu 2024,,,0
Preference of musculoskeletal pain treatment in middle-aged and elderly chinese people: a machine learning analysis of the China health and retirement longitudinal study.,Mei F; Dong S; Li J; Xing D; Lin J,"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal pain is a major cause of physical disability, associated with huge socioeconomic burden. Patient preference for treatment is an important factor contributing to the choice of treatment strategies. However, effective measurements for evaluating the ongoing management of musculoskeletal pain are lacking. To help improve clinical decision making, it's important to estimate the current state of musculoskeletal pain management and analyze the contribution of patient treatment preference. METHODS: A nationally representative sample for the Chinese population was derived from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Information on the patients' demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, other health-related behavior, as well as history on musculoskeletal pain and treatment data were obtained. The data was used to estimate the status of musculoskeletal pain treatment in China in the year 2018. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were used to find the effect factors of treatment preference. XGBoost model and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method were performed to analyze the contribution of each variable to different treatment preferences. RESULTS: Among 18,814 respondents, 10,346 respondents suffered from musculoskeletal pain. Approximately 50% of musculoskeletal pain patients preferred modern medicine, while about 20% chose traditional Chinese medicine and another 15% chose acupuncture or massage therapy. Differing preferences for musculoskeletal pain treatment was related to the respondents' gender, age, place of residence, education level, insurance status, and health-related behavior such as smoking and drinking. Compared with upper or lower limb pain, neck pain and lower back pain were more likely to make respondents choose massage therapy (P < 0.05). A greater number of pain sites was associated with an increasing preference for respondents to seek medical care for musculoskeletal pain (P < 0.05), while different pain sites did not affect treatment preference. CONCLUSION: Factors including gender, age, socioeconomic status, and health-related behavior may have potential effects on people' s choice of treatment for musculoskeletal pain. The information derived from this study may be useful for helping to inform clinical decisions for orthopedic surgeons when devising treatment strategies for musculoskeletal pain.",2023,Jun,BMC Musculoskelet Disord,24,1,528,,10.1186/s12891-023-06665-7,37386480,#1145,Mei 2023,,,0
Comparing the Long-Term Success Rates of Tooth Preservation and Dental Implants: A Critical Review.,Sartoretto SC; Shibli JA; Javid K; Cotrim K; Canabarro A; Louro RS; Lowenstein A; Mourão CF; Moraschini V,"Implant therapy is considered a predictable, safe, and reliable rehabilitation method for edentulous patients in most clinical scenarios. Thus, there is a growing trend in the indications for implants, which seems attributable not only to their clinical success but also to arguments such as a more ""simplified approach"" based on convenience or the belief that dental implants are as good as natural teeth. Therefore, the objective of this critical literature review of observational studies was to discuss the evidence concerning the long-term survival rates and treatment outcomes, comparing endodontically or periodontally treated teeth with dental implants. Altogether, the evidence suggests that the decision between keeping a tooth or replacing it with an implant should carefully consider the condition of the tooth (e.g., amount of remaining tooth and degree of attachment loss and mobility), systemic disorders, and patient preference. Although observational studies revealed high success rates and long-term survival of dental implants, failures and complications are common. For this reason, attempts should be made to first save maintainable teeth over the long-term, instead of immediately replacing teeth with dental implants.",2023,Mar,J Funct Biomater,14,3,,,10.3390/jfb14030142,36976066,#1422,Sartoretto 2023,,,0
Gaps in Patient-Centered Decision-Making Related to Complex Surgery: A Mixed-Methods Study.,Palmer Kelly E; Rush LJ; Eramo JL; Melnyk HL; Tarver WL; Waterman BL; Gustin J; Pawlik TM,"INTRODUCTION: We sought to understand the perceptions of surgeons around patient preferred roles in decision-making and their approaches to patient-centered decision-making (PCDM). METHODS: A concurrent embedded mixed-methods design was utilized among a cohort of surgeons performing complex surgical procedures. Data were collected through online surveys. Associations between perceptions and PCDM approaches were examined. RESULTS: Among 241 participants, most respondents were male (67.2%) with an average age of 47.6 y (standard deviation = 10.3); roughly half (52.4%) had practiced medicine for 10 or more years. Surgeons most frequently agreed (94.2%) with the statement, ""Patients prefer to make health decisions on their own after seriously considering their physician's opinion."" Conversely, surgeons most frequently disagreed (73.0%) with the statement, ""Patients prefer that their physician make health decisions for them."" Nearly one-third (30.4%) of surgeon qualitative responses (n = 115) indicated that clinical/biological information would help them tailor their approach to PCDM. Only 12.2% of respondents indicated that they assess patient preferences regarding both decision-making and information needs. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons most frequently agree that patients want to make their own health decisions after seriously considering their physicians opinion.

Pancreatitis sepsis: Evolution and principles in the management of necrotizing pancreatitis.,Roy M; Kocher HM,"Outcomes from some recent clinical trials have helped to improve the management of necrotizing pancreatitis over the last 2 decades. The location of the retroperitoneal collection, previous gastric surgery, patient preference, and medical expertise dictates a minimally invasive surgical step-up versus endoscopic approach. Endoscopic drainage is facilitated by either a plastic or metallic stent. Direct endoscopic necrosectomy is performed for lack of improvement after endoscopic drainage. The surgical approach is accomplished by minimally invasive surgery with either video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement or laparoscopic drainage.

Modified forced expiration technique using expiratory resistance in adults with cystic fibrosis.,Watson K; Koenig E; Bannister A; Mayne V; Jacques A; Sawyer A; Wood J,"BACKGROUND: Participation in airway clearance techniques (ACT) is important to minimise development of irreversible airway obstruction in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) and expiratory resistance devices (ERD) are often used as they can improve collateral ventilation and aid in the shearing of mucus from airways. This project looked to identify whether utilising an ERD during a forced expiration technique (FET) improves ease of expectoration, sputum amount and coughing frequency in patients with CF. METHOD: Patients with CF admitted for a respiratory exacerbation completed two sessions of 10 cycles of their usual ACT with half of the FET components performed with an ERD, half with FET alone. RESULTS: EOE, sputum wet weight, cough frequency and patient preference were similar between groups. Improved EOE without the ERD was found in participants who usually use PEP for their ACT regime. CONCLUSION: Combining the FET with a PEP mask did not improve EOE and other outcomes in this small study.

Patients' preferences for secondary prevention following a coronary event.,van Trier TJ; Jørstad HT; Scholte Op Reimer WJM; Sunamura M; Ter Hoeve N; Aernout Somsen G; Peters RJG; Snaterse M,"OBJECTIVE: Despite clear evidence on the effectiveness of secondary prevention, patients with coronary artery disease frequently fail to reach guideline-based risk factor targets. Integrating patients' preferences into treatment decisions has been recommended to reduce this gap. However, this requires knowledge about patient treatment preferences. Therefore, through a survey study, we aimed to explore which risk factors patients self-perceived, prioritised for improvement, and needed support with after a recent hospitalisation for coronary heart disease. METHODS: A digital questionnaire was presented to patients > 18 years recently discharged (≤3 months) from an acute coronary care unit in the Netherlands (Europe). Patients could select from eight cardiovascular risk factors that they (1) self-perceived, (2) prioritised for improvement, and (3) needed support to improve. Patients' perceived risk factors were compared to those documented in the medical records. RESULTS: Respondents (N = 254, 26 % women), mean age 64 (SD 10) years, identified 'physical inactivity' more frequently than their medical records (140 patients vs. 91 records, p < 0.001), while three other risk factors were reported with equal and four with lower frequency. 'Physical inactivity', 'overweight' and 'stress' were most frequently prioritised for improvement (82 %, 88 % and 78 %) and professional support (64 %, 50 % and 58 %), with 87 % preferring lifestyle optimisation if this would reduce drug use. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a recent coronary event show significant disparities in identifying risk factors compared to their medical records. They tend to prefer improving lifestyle- over drug-modifiable risk factors, particularly physical inactivity, overweight and stress, and indicate the need for support in improving these factors.",2024,Apr,Prev Med Rep,40,,102681,,10.1016/j.pmedr.2024.102681,38495768,#181,vanTrier 2024,,,0
Out-of-Pocket Cost Modeling of Adjuvant Radiation Therapy Duration in Standard-of-Care Early Stage Breast Cancer Treatment Across Medicaid and Medicare Plans.,Wu VS; Khlopin M; Jagsi R; McClelland S 3rd,"PURPOSE: For early stage breast cancer (BC), the choice of radiation therapy duration (1 vs 3 weeks) is highly debated. Cost and financial toxicity are major concerns that patients with BC face. Nonetheless, there remain limited discussions providing granular details of the role of insurance in the aggregate cost of 1 week versus 3 weeks of radiation therapy for patients. This project aims to disaggregate costs by plan to increase transparency of out-of-pocket (OOP) cost estimates in radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Treatment procedures were determined through the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. OOP treatment costs, deductibles, and copays/coinsurance were calculated by using Medicaid, Original Medicare, Medigap Plan G, and Medicare Part D prescription plans. The medicare.gov, medicaid.oh.gov, aarpmedicareplans.com, and the physician fee schedule from cms.gov were used to determine costs by treatment. Price estimates reflect actual costs per insurance plan rather than costs estimated from claims data. All procedures were considered to be performed in an Ohio hospital setting. One-week radiation therapy was defined as 5 fractions without boost, and 3-week radiation therapy was defined as 15 fractions without boost. RESULTS: Medicare beneficiaries with Original Medicare coverage face an OOP treatment charge of $649.24 for 1 week of radiation therapy and $1006.20 for 3 weeks of radiation therapy. Assuming the deductible is met postlumpectomy, Medigap Plan G beneficiaries are faced with no additional charges for both lengths of radiation therapy. Similarly for Medicaid beneficiaries (assuming treatment is approved by Medicaid), all expenses are covered without limit, resulting in no OOP expense. CONCLUSIONS: Considerations of 1 and 3 weeks of radiation therapy for postlumpectomy early-stage BC are often dependent on cancer characteristics and patient preferences. This model (based on actual cost estimates per insurance plan rather than claims data) compares OOP costs across Medicaid and Medicare plans, which more holistically informs providers and patients in radiation therapy duration decision making.",2024,Jan-Feb,Pract Radiat Oncol,14,1,24-27,,10.1016/j.prro.2023.09.003,37748680,#525,Wu 2024,,,0
Evaluating the impact of interprofessional training wards on patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes: a mixed-methods analysis.,Schlosser-Hupf S; Aichner E; Meier M; Albaladejo-Fuertes S; Ruttmann K; Rusch S; Michels B; Mehrl A; Kunst C; Schmid S; Müller M,"INTRODUCTION: Interprofessional teamwork is pivotal in modern healthcare, prompting the establishment of interprofessional training wards since 1996. While these wards serve as hubs for optimizing healthcare professional collaboration and communication, research into patient outcomes remains notably sparse and geographically limited, predominantly examining patient satisfaction and sparingly exploring other metrics like mortality or self-discharge rates. This study seeks to bridge this gap, comparing patient outcomes in interprofessional training wards and conventional wards under the hypothesis that the former offers no disadvantage to patient outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We explored patient outcomes within an interprofessional student ward called A-STAR at a University Hospital from October 2019 to December 2022. Engaging with patients discharged between May 2021 and April 2022, we utilized digital and paper-based anonymous questionnaires, catering to patient preference, to gather pertinent data. RESULTS: Analysis of outcomes for 1,482 A-STAR (interprofessional student ward) and 5,752 conventional ward patients revealed noteworthy findings. A-STAR patients tended to be younger (59 vs. 61 years, p < 0.01) and more frequently male (73.5% vs. 70.4%, p = 0.025). Vital clinical outcomes, such as discharges against medical advice, complication-driven readmissions, and ICU transfers, were statistically similar between groups, as were mortality rates (1.2% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.468). A-STAR demonstrated high patient satisfaction, underscored by positive reflections on team competence, ward atmosphere, and responsiveness to concerns, emphasizing the value placed on interprofessional collaboration. Patient narratives commended team kindness, lucid explanations, and proactive involvement. DISCUSSION: This data collectively underscores the safety and reliability of patient care within training wards, affirming that patients can trust the care provided in these settings. Patients on the interprofessional ward demonstrated high satisfaction levels: 96.7% appreciated the atmosphere and conduct of ward rounds.

DEXTENZA versus Topical Steroid or Antihistamine Therapy for Treatment of Allergic Conjunctivitis.,Reich S; Lopez M; Leff J; Herman J,"PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes and patient preference for the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (DEX) versus topical loteprednol (LOT) or olopatadine (OLO) for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in a real-world model of allergen exposure. METHODS: This was a prospective comparative trial. Adults with testing-confirmed bilateral allergic conjunctivitis received DEX in the more symptomatic eye and either LOT 2 times daily or OLO once daily for 30 days in the fellow eye. The primary outcome was patient preference for treatment. Clinical outcomes included ocular itching and hyperemia, lid swelling, and watering/tearing. Safety outcomes included intraocular pressure (IOP). RESULTS: Thirty patients participated and completed the study. All received DEX in the eye with worse symptoms and 15 received LOT and the other 15 received OLO in the other eye. Patients preferred DEX (10/15; 66.7%) over LOT (4/15; 26.7%), with one patient having no preference (p = 0.0103). Patients had no preference between DEX (8/15; 53.3%) and OLO (6/15; 40%), with one patient having no preference (p = 0.1044). In the DEX/LOT cohort, ocular itching and hyperemia improved more with DEX than LOT (p ≤ 0.009), while in the DEX/OLO cohort, the DEX eyes showed greater improvement in conjunctival hyperemia (p < 0.0001) but not itching (p = 0.074). No between-group differences were seen in eyelid swelling or tearing/watering in either cohort. Mean change in IOP was similar between the DEX and LOT eyes (p = 0.4921), and mean IOP rose more in the DEX eyes than the OLO eyes (by <1 mmHg; p = 0.0403). CONCLUSION: Overall, this real-world study demonstrated that the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert was as effective as a topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer and more effective than topical steroids in relieving the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. This insert should be considered as an alternative to topical therapy for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.",2024,,Clin Ophthalmol,18,,473-480,,10.2147/OPTH.S440840,38375441,#368,Reich 2024,,,0
'CROSS'-ing into the 'Real World': a retrospective cohort study of patients receiving trimodality and bimodality therapy for esophageal cancer.,Higgins LM; Lester-Coll NH; Ades S; Barry MM; Borrazzo EC; Ganguly EK; Anker CJ,"BACKGROUND: A standard of care for nonmetastatic esophageal cancer is trimodality therapy consisting of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and esophagectomy, with evidence for improved overall survival versus surgery alone in the ChemoRadiotherapy for Oesophageal cancer followed by Surgery Study (CROSS) trial. Patients who receive treatment with curative intent but are poor candidates for or decline surgery receive definitive bimodality therapy. Literature characterizing patients who receive bimodality therapy compared to trimodality therapy, and their relative outcomes, is sparse, especially among patients who are too old or too frail to qualify for clinical trials. In this study, we assess a single-institution real-world dataset of patients receiving bimodality and trimodality management. METHODS: Patients treated for clinically resectable, nonmetastatic esophageal cancer between 2009 and 2019 who received bimodality or trimodality therapy were reviewed, generating a dataset of 95 patients. Clinical variables and patient characteristics were assessed for association with modality on multivariable logistic regression. Overall, relapse-free, and disease-free survival were assessed with Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional modeling. For patients nonadherent to planned esophagectomy, reasons for nonadherence were recorded. RESULTS: Bimodality therapy was associated with greater age-adjusted comorbidity index, worse performance status, higher N-stage, presenting symptom other than dysphagia, and held chemotherapy cycles on multivariable analysis. Compared to bimodality therapy, trimodality therapy was associated with higher overall (3-year: 62% vs. 18%, P<0.001), relapse-free (3-year: 71% vs. 18%, P<0.001), and disease-free (3-year: 58% vs. 12%, P<0.001) survival. Similar results were observed among patients who did not meet CROSS trial qualifying criteria. Only treatment modality was associated with overall survival after adjusting for covariates (HR 0.37, P<0.001, reference group: bimodality). Patient choice accounted for 40% of surgery nonadherence in our population. CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving trimodality therapy were observed to have superior overall survival compared to bimodality therapy. Patient preference for organ-preserving therapies appears to impact resection rate; further characterization of patient decision-making may be helpful. Our results suggest patients who wish to prioritize overall survival should be encouraged to pursue trimodality therapy and obtain early consultation with surgery. Development of evidence-based interventions to physiologically prepare patients before and during neoadjuvant therapy as well as efforts to optimize the tolerability of the chemoradiation plan are warranted.",2023,Apr,J Gastrointest Oncol,14,2,480-493,,10.21037/jgo-22-633,37201058,#1306,Higgins 2023,,,0
Racial Disparity in Tympanostomy Tube Placement in Inpatient Pediatric Admissions.,Danis DO 3rd; Palmer WJ; Bachrach K; Tracy LF; Levi JR,"This study aims to evaluate if race and ethnicity affect rates of tympanostomy tube (TT) placement during inpatient pediatric admissions in children with otologic conditions. A review of the 2016 Kids' Inpatient Database was conducted based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes for common otologic conditions. Among 85 827 weighted pediatric inpatient discharges with ICD-10-CM codes for common otologic conditions, 213 underwent TT placement. Odds ratios (ORs) for children of Hispanic ethnicity and Asian or Pacific Islander race undergoing TT placement when compared to other ethnicities and races were 0.60 (P = .011) and 0.21 (P = .040), respectively. Multiple logistic regression showed Hispanic ethnicity was associated with lower rates of TT placement when compared to non-Hispanic white children (OR = 0.62; 95% confidence interval = 0.40-0.96).

Differences in Preferences for Drug Therapy Between Patients with Metastatic Versus Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Systematic Literature Review.,Brandstetter LS; Jírů-Hillmann S; Störk S; Heuschmann PU; Wöckel A; Reese JP,"INTRODUCTION: Compared with early stages (eBC) metastatic BC (mBC) is incurable. In mBC, aggressive treatment may increase the duration of survival but may also cause severe treatment side effects. A better understanding how patients with BC value different aspects of drug therapy might improve treatment effectiveness, satisfaction and adherence. This systematic review aims to identify and summarise studies evaluating patient preferences for drug therapy of BC and to compare preferences of patients with eBC and mBC. METHODS: The systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The electronic databases PubMed and Web of Science were searched on 22 June 2023. All studies published to this point were considered. Original studies reporting patient preferences on BC drug therapy determined by any type of choice experiment were eligible. A narrative synthesis of the effect measures presented as relative importance ratings, trade-offs (required benefit to make a therapy worthwhile) or monetary values of the treatment attributes was reported for each study. Risk of bias assessment for individual studies was performed using the checklist for observational studies from the STROBE Statement and the checklist from 'Conducting Discrete Choice Experiments to Inform Healthcare Decision Making: A User's Guide'. The study protocol was registered at the PROSPERO database (CRD42022377031). RESULTS: A total of 34 studies met the inclusion criteria were included in the analysis evaluating the preferences of patients with eBC (n = 18), mBC (n = 10) or any stage BC (n = 6) on, for example, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, hormonal therapy or CKD4/6-inhibitors using different types of choice experiments. Regardless of the stage, most patients valued treatment effectiveness in terms of survival gains higher than potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Treatment cost, mode of administration, treatment regimen and monitoring aspects were considered as least important treatment attributes. In addition, preferences concerning 16 different types of ADRs were described, showing high heterogeneity within BC stages. Yet, comparable results across BC stages were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the stage, patients with BC consistently valued survival gains as the most important attribute and were willing to accept the risk of potential ADRs. Incorporating patient preferences in shared decision making may improve the effectiveness of interventions by enhancing adherence to drug therapy in patients suffering from BC.",2024,Mar,Patient,,,,,10.1007/s40271-024-00679-6,38451419,#254,Brandstetter 2024,,,1
Shared decision making in patients with substance use disorders: A one-year follow-up study.,Serrano-Pérez P; Rivero-Santana A; Daigre-Blanco C; Palma-Álvarez RF; Nistal-Franco I; Antoni Ramos-Quiroga J; Grau-López L,"Patient-centered care in therapeutic processes has been associated with better clinical outcomes, however, it remains a poorly studied aspect in Substance Use Disorder (SUD). The study aimed to evaluate patient's preferences, perceived participation in treatment decisions and activation level; and how they predict retention, pharmacological adherence and substance use during one-year follow-up. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between independent variables, along with a wide number of sociodemographic and clinical covariates, and outcomes. Most patients prefer a shared or passive role when making decisions about their treatment, and showed concordance between their preferred and perceived roles. In the univariate models, perceiving more involvement than desired showed a higher likelihood of treatment discontinuation at 12 months, and substance use at 6 and 12 months. No significant associations were found between the remaining decisional variables or the degree of activation with the assessed outcomes. A majority of SUD patients prefer and perceive to be involved in the decision-making process about their treatment. Patients perceiving more involvement than desired might experience an excess of responsibility that could negatively influence treatment continuation and substance use. Limitations of the study preclude any definitive conclusion, and more research is needed to confirm these results.",2023,Nov,Psychiatry Res,329,,115540,,10.1016/j.psychres.2023.115540,37857131,#711,Serrano-Pérez 2023,,,0

Survey of lived experiences and challenges in hepatitis B management and treatment.,Freeland C; Adjei C; Wallace J; Wang S; Hicks J; Adda D; James C; Cohen C,"Almost 300 million people are living with chronic hepatitis B infection worldwide and most remain undiagnosed and at risk for liver cancer. In 2015 the World Health Organization (WHO) developed guidelines for the prevention, care, and treatment of persons with chronic hepatitis B and in early 2023 began to work on updating these guidelines. In March 2023, a self-administered, anonymous online survey was launched, aiming to identify patient preferences related to the clinical management of hepatitis B including current management, treatment, and care experiences, preferences regarding engagement with providers, and preferences related to simplifying hepatitis B care access. A sample of 560 individuals living with hepatitis B (self-identified as HBsAg positive) from 76 countries completed the survey. Key findings demonstrated that less than half (49%, N = 268) of participants regularly visited a doctor to check the health of their liver (every 6-12 months), with 37% of participants prescribed antiviral medication by a specialist (82%, N = 167) or general practitioner (13%, N = 26). Participants reported not being actively involved in care decision making with their providers (42%, N = 217), with an overwhelming majority wanting to participate in hepatitis B management and treatment choices (85%, N = 435). Participants provided qualitative and quantitative details using open-ended responses within the survey about challenges with medication affordability and receiving care from a knowledgeable provider. Overall findings demonstrated key gaps in care, management, and treatment access related to hepatitis B: identifying these gaps can be used to identify areas for improvement along the care continuum for viral hepatitis. The survey found a need for the comprehensive simplification of clinical management and health care services related to hepatitis B. A thematic analysis of the open-ended survey responses highlighted major overarching themes including the cost and access burdens associated with hepatitis B management and treatment, and challenges in finding knowledgeable providers. Results from this mixed methods survey were used to inform the WHO hepatitis B guidelines update. Efforts should continue to explore public health approaches to address barriers and facilitators to testing, care, and treatment for people with hepatitis B to improve awareness of hepatitis B and access, care, and treatment among patients and providers.",2024,Apr,BMC Public Health,24,1,944,,10.1186/s12889-024-18425-w,38566070,#177,Freeland 2024,,,0
Patient's preferences: an unmet need by current urolithiasis guidelines: a systematic review.,Pauchard F; Ventimiglia E; Traxer O,"INTRODUCTION: Shared decision making (SDM) in surgical specialties was demonstrated to diminish decisional regret, decisional anxiety and decisional conflict. Urolithiasis guidelines do not explicit patient preference to choose treatment. The aim of this review article was to perform a systematic evaluation of published evidence regarding SDM in urinary stone treatment. METHODS: A systematic review in accordance PRISMA checklist was conducted using the MEDLINE (PubMed) database. Inclusion criteria were studies that evaluated stone treatment preferences. Reviews, editorials, case reports and video abstracts were excluded. ROBUST checklist was used to assess quality of the studies. RESULTS: 188 articles were obtained. After applying the predefined selection criteria, seven articles were included for final analysis. Six out of seven studies were questionnaires that propose clinical scenarios and treatment alternatives. The last study was a patient preference trial. A general trend among included studies showed a patient preference towards the least invasive option (SWL over URS). The main reasons to choose one treatment over the other were stone-free rates, risk of complications and invasiveness. DISCUSSION: This review provides an overview of the patients' preferences towards stone treatment in small- and medium-sized stones. There was a clear preference towards the least invasive management strategy. The main reason was less invasiveness. This is opposed to the global trends of performing more ureteroscopies and less SWL. Physicians played a pivotal role in counselling patients. SDM should be encouraged and improved.

Patient-centered care in von Willebrand disease: are we there yet?,Tang GH; Thachil J; Bowman M; Bekdache C; James PD; Sholzberg M,"INTRODUCTION: Von Willebrand Disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. Paradoxically, affected individuals are often misdiagnosed and experience substantial diagnostic delay. There are sex-specific health disparities in VWD rooted in the stigmatization of vaginal bleeding, which leads to symptom dismissal, lack of timely access to care and lower health-related quality of life. AREAS COVERED: Following the core elements of patient-centered care - respect for patient preferences, values, and needs, we describe the current state of VWD care. Challenges of diagnostic delay, serial misrecognition of abnormal bleeding, and symptom dismissal are barriers that disproportionately affect women with VWD. These negative effects are further amplified in individuals living in low- and middle-income countries. We describe the importance of coordinated multidisciplinary care, as well as the need for patient education and empowered self-advocacy. EXPERT OPINION: While tremendous work has been done to improve the diagnosis and management of VWD, timely and high-quality research is urgently needed to address care gaps. Systemic changes such as resource investment, dedicated research funding for novel treatment modalities, and effective knowledge translation strategies to address structural barriers are needed to facilitate effective patient-centered care for VWD.",2023,Jul-Dec,Expert Rev Hematol,16,9,641-649,,10.1080/17474086.2023.2243386,37581602,#1087,Tang 2023,,,0
Treatment preferences towards thrombopoietin-receptor agonists for immune thrombocytopenia and experience of disease (TRAPeze): Italy cohort.,Lucchesi A; Lovrencic B; McDonald V; Newland A; Morgan M; Eriksson D; Wilson K; Giordano G; Carli G; Geldman E; Daykin-Pont O; Prince S; Napolitano M,"OBJECTIVE: Identify patient preference towards thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) and determine the clinical and social impact of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in Italy. METHODS: The Thrombopoietin-Receptor Agonist Patient experience (TRAPeze) survey collected responses from Italian residents from 17th January to 28th February 2022. TRAPeze utilized a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit patient preferences towards TPO-RA attributes and a patient burden survey (PBS) to determine ITP disease characteristics and social impact. RESULTS: Seventy-six respondents completed the DCE, of which 69 completed both the DCE and PBS (mean [range] age 45 [18.0-73.0] years, 80% female). TPO-RA attributes with the greatest influence over respondent choice were method of administration (odds ratio [OR] 2.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.16-4.06), drug-food interactions (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.17-1.86) and frequency of dosing (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.15-1.52). Respondents were more likely to prefer therapies administered orally over subcutaneous injection (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.51-5.63), once weekly over once daily (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.26-2.65), and therapies without food restrictions over with restrictions (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.17-2.14).The most frequently reported symptoms were bruising (82%), petechiae (65%) and fatigue (64%). Most respondents (84%) felt ITP impacted familial relationships and 71% of employed respondents reported fatigue influencing their ability to work, with 31% reducing working hours. CONCLUSION: Although responses indicated a moderate perception of general health, ITP clearly impacted respondent work and social life.

How Physicians Tackle Internet-Misinformed Patients: Going Beyond Traditional Patient-Centered Communication - A Study Protocol.,Lu Q; Schulz PJ,"BACKGROUND: The proliferation of misleading and irrelevant health information on the Internet has become a significant public concern. Inappropriate use of online materials can cause harm to patients' health and quality of life. While close attention has been paid to health campaigns and education programs that aim to disseminate accurate health knowledge, the role of physicians, who directly communicate with patients in medical encounters and provide personalized information, has been overlooked. Therefore, this study focuses on physicians and their communication strategies with internet-misinformed patients (IMPs). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the communicative strategies physicians use to tackle IMPs and explore connections between physicians' communicative strategies and patient-centered communication. METHODS: Approximately 10 to 15 physicians from diverse cultural backgrounds, including Ticino (an Italian-speaking region in Switzerland), Milan and China will be interviewed. Interviews will be conducted in-person or online through video conferencing software programs. Physicians will be asked about their experiences with IMPs, communicative strategies for addressing patients' misconceptions, balancing patient preferences, decision-making obstacles, and envisioning an ideal relationship with them. A thematic analysis will be utilized to analyze data, employing a general inductive approach. DISCUSSION: The results will provide valuable insights into effective clinical communication strategies that address patients' misuse of internet materials and inform policymakers and healthcare providers about the limitations and applicability of patient-centered communication in the current digital era.",2023,,Adv Med Educ Pract,14,,983-988,,10.2147/AMEP.S425434,37701424,#888,Lu 2023,,,0
Cancer Patients' Preferences and Perceptions of Advantages and Disadvantages of Telehealth Visits During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,Kumar D; Gordon N; Zamani C; Sheehan T; Martin E; Egorova O; Payne J; Kolevska T; Neeman E; Liu R,"PURPOSE: We aimed to ascertain oncology patients' perceptions of telehealth versus in-person (IP) visits for different types of clinical encounters. METHODS: We surveyed adults undergoing cancer treatment at Kaiser Permanente Northern California infusion centers between November 2021 and May 2022 using a self-administered questionnaire. Patients were asked about visit modality preferences (video, phone, and IP) for six types of clinical discussions, overall advantages and disadvantages of telehealth (video or phone) versus IP modalities, and barriers to video visit use. RESULTS: The 839 patients who completed surveys in English were 63% female; median age 63 years; 64% White; and 73% college-educated (45% ≥bachelor's degree). For the first postdiagnosis discussion visit, 83% of patients preferred IP, followed by video (27%) and phone (18%). For follow-up visits, 52% of patients preferred IP, 50% video, and 37% phone. For discussions of bad news and sensitive topics, respectively, 68% and 62% preferred IP, 44% and 48% video, and 32% and 41% phone visits. Delivery of good news was acceptable through IP (49%), video (52%), or phone (49%) visits. Perceived advantages of IP visits were greater feelings of connection with their doctor (58%), confidence in physical examinations (73%), and ease in showing things (67%) and talking (51%) to the doctor. Advantages of telehealth visits included saved time (72%) and money (38%), less infection exposure (64%), less travel concerns (45%), and ability to include more people (28%). Of 24% of patients who felt video visits would be hard, 51% cited poor internet, 41% lack of an adequate device, and 28% difficulty signing on.

How should respiratory depression and loss of airway patency be handled during initiation of palliative sedation?,Fredheim OMS; Torvund SK; Thoresen L; Magelssen M,BACKGROUND: Loss of airway patency has been reported during initiation of palliative sedation. In present guidelines the loss of airway patency during initiation of palliative sedation is not addressed. Airway patency can be restored by jaw thrust/chin lift or placing the patient in the recovery position. AIM: A structured ethical analysis of how respiratory depression and loss of airway patency during initiation of palliative sedation should be handled. The essence of the dilemma is whether it is appropriate to apply simple non-invasive methods to restore airway patency in order to avoid the patient's immediate death. DESIGN: A structured analysis based on the four principles of healthcare ethics and stakeholders' interests. RESULTS: Beneficence and autonomy support a decision not to regain airway patency whereas non-maleficence lends weight to a decision to restore airway patency. Whether the proportionality criterion of the principle of double effect is met depends on the features of the individual case. The ethical problem appears to be a genuine dilemma where important values and arguments point to different conclusions. CONCLUSION: Whether to restore airway patency when the airway is obstructed during initiation of palliative sedation will ultimately be based on clinical judgment taking into account both any known patient preferences and relevant clinical information. There are strong arguments favoring both options in this clinical and ethical dilemma. The fact that a clear and universal recommendation cannot be made does not imply indifference regarding what is the clinically and ethically best option for each individual patient.,2024,Feb,Acta Anaesthesiol Scand,,,,,10.1111/aas.14396,38391048,#345,FredheimOMS 2024,,,0

We compared demographic and clinical parameters between patients with once- vs. multiple-daily dosing in the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Regensburg, Germany (AGATE dataset), and the Department of Psychiatry, Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland, using non-parametric tests. Effectiveness and safety outcomes were available in the AGATE dataset. We performed a systematic review in PubMed/Embase until February 2022, meta-analyzing studies comparing clozapine once- vs. multiple-daily-dosing. We estimated a pooled odds ratio for adverse drug-induced reactions (ADRs) and meta-analyzed differences regarding clinical symptom severity, age, percentage males, smokers, clozapine dose, and co-medications between patients receiving once- vs. multiple-daily dosing. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale. Of 1494 and 174 patients included in AGATE and Lausanne datasets, clozapine was prescribed multiple-daily in 74.8% and 67.8%, respectively. In the AGATE cohort, no differences were reported for the clinical symptoms severity or ADR rate (p > 0.05). Meta-analyzing eight cohorts with a total of 2810 clozapine-treated individuals, we found more severe clinical symptoms (p = 0.036), increased ADR risk (p = 0.01), higher clozapine doses (p < 0.001), more frequent co-medication with other antipsychotics (p < 0.001), benzodiazepines (p < 0.001), anticholinergics (p = 0.039), and laxatives (p < 0.001) in patients on multiple- vs. once-daily dosing. Of six studies, five were rated as good, and one as poor quality.

Beyond satisfaction in person-centered pharmacy services.,Murry LT; Desselle SP,"Patient self-reported satisfaction is commonly used as an assessment of service experience and quality for community pharmacy services. This commentary discusses alternative foundational approaches to evaluating service experience and quality in patient-centered care. It describes historical and recent literature pertaining to the development and use of satisfaction measures for service design and patient experience assessment. It then highlights potential limitations of patient satisfaction as an assessment tool for patient-centeredness and patient experience identified in the pharmacy literature, which include criticisms that use of patient satisfaction may compromise accuracy in measuring quality due to factors such as patients having poor knowledge of and low expectations for quality and having a predisposition toward rating satisfaction highly when experiencing no-cost and/or unfamiliar services. Moreover, satisfaction measurements may change based on service exposure, with patient preferences for service offerings changing with increased service exposure and variation in patient-specific and environmental factors. After discussing limitations and criticism of patient self-reported satisfaction, we introduce alternative assessments methods which may facilitate more accurate assessments of patient experience and patient-centered pharmacy services such as patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs), patient-reported experience measures (PREMs), and human-centered design techniques such as journey mapping, prototyping, and user testing to design and assess patient-centered pharmacy services. These alternative assessments are rooted in, or related to preferred implementation science approaches to establishing, evaluating, and sustaining pharmacy services.",2023,Dec,Explor Res Clin Soc Pharm,12,,100355,,10.1016/j.rcsop.2023.100355,38023636,#597,Murry 2023,,,0

The objectives of the study were to assess the available evidence of the indications and adverse events (AEs) of LITT and 1-year progression-free survival and 1-year overall survival in the treatment of primary and secondary brain tumors. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted through the databases PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library until October 2021. Comparative and descriptive studies, except for case reports, were included in the meta-analysis. Separate analyses by tumor type (high-grade gliomas, including World Health Organization grade 4 astrocytomas [which include glioblastomas] as a specific subgroup; low-grade gliomas; and brain metastases) were conducted. Pooled effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were generated via random-effects models. RESULTS: Forty-five studies met the inclusion criteria, yielding 826 patients for meta-analysis. There were 829 lesions in total, of which 361 were classified as high-grade gliomas, 116 as low-grade gliomas, 337 as metastatic brain tumors, and 15 as nonglial tumors. Indications for offering LITT included deep/inaccessible tumor (12 studies), salvage therapy after failed radiosurgery (9), failures of ≥2 treatment options (3), in pediatric patients (4), patient preference (1); indications were nonspecific in 12 studies. Pooled incidence of all (minor or major) procedure-related AEs was 30% (95% CI, 27%-40%) for all tumors. Pooled incidence of neurologic deficits (minor or major) was 16% (12%-22%); postprocedural edema 14% (8%-22%); seizure 6% (4%-9%); hematoma 20% (14%-29%); deep vein thrombosis 19% (11%-30%); hydrocephalus 8% (5%-12%); and wound infection 5% (3%-7%). One-year progression-free survival was 18.6% (11.3%-29.0%) in high-grade gliomas, 16.9% (11.6%-24.0%) among the grade 4 astrocytomas; and 51.2% (36.7%-65.5%) in brain metastases. One-year overall survival was 43.0% (36.0%-50.0%) in high-grade glioma, 45.9% (95% CI, 37.9%-54%) in grade 4 astrocytomas; 93.0% (42.3%-100%) in low-grade gliomas, and 56.3% (47.0%-65.3%) in brain metastases. CONCLUSIONS: New neurologic deficits and postprocedural edema were the most reported AEs after LITT, albeit mostly transient. This meta-analysis provides the best statistical estimates of progression and survival outcomes based on the available information. LITT is generally a safe procedure for selected patients, and future well-designed comparative studies on its outcomes versus the current standard of care should be performed.",2023,Mar,World Neurosurg,171,,e654-e671,,10.1016/j.wneu.2022.12.079,36549438,#1466,Alkazemi 2023,,,0
Nursing Home Resident Preferences for Daily Care and Activities: A Latent Class Analysis of National Data.,Duan Y; Ng W; Bowblis JR; Akosionu O; Shippee TP,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Uncovering subgroups of nursing home residents sharing similar preference patterns is useful for developing systematic approaches to person-centered care. This study aimed to (i) identify preference patterns among long-stay residents, and (ii) examine the associations of preference patterns with resident and facility characteristics. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a national cross-sectional analysis of Minimum Data Set assessments in 2016. Using resident-rated importance for 16 preference items in the Preference Assessment Tool as indicators, we conducted latent class analysis to identify preference patterns and examined their associations with resident and facility characteristics. RESULTS: We identified 4 preference patterns. The high salience group (43.5% of the sample) was the most likely to rate all preferences as important, whereas the low salience group (8.7%) was the least likely. The socially engaged (27.2%) and the socially independent groups (20.6%) featured high importance ratings on social/recreational activities and maintaining privacy/autonomy, respectively. The high salience group reported more favorable physical and sensory function than the other 3 groups and lived in facilities with higher staffing of activity staff. The low salience and socially independent groups reported a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms, whereas the low salience or socially engaged groups reported a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment. Preference patterns also varied by race/ethnicity and gender. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our study advanced the understanding of within-individual variations in preferences, and the role of individual and environmental factors in shaping preferences. The findings provided implications for providing person-centered care in NHs.",2024,Feb,Gerontologist,64,2,,,10.1093/geront/gnad089,37432373,#438,Duan 2024,,,0
Supporting the Safe Use of the Dorsogluteal Intramuscular Injection Site: An Evidence-Based Quality Improvement Project.,Kilroy G; Lorbiecki M; Ndakuya-Fitzgerald F; Hagle M,"INTRODUCTION: Administering intramuscular (IM) injections is common in the adult mental health patient care setting, using the deltoid, vastus lateralis, ventrogluteal, or dorsogluteal site. Mental health nurses frequently use the dorsogluteal site to administer short and long-acting IM injections as specified in the drug package insert or because of patient agitation. However, the site is often not recommended due to the potential risk of nerve injury. AIMS: Aims of this evidence-based quality improvement project were to (1) determine the best evidence for supporting the safe use of the dorsogluteal site for short and long-acting IM injections and (2) implement this evidence through nurse education. METHOD: This project had two phases: Determining best evidence through an integrative literature review and implementing the recommendations to use the dorsogluteal site when directed by the drug package insert, clinical need, nursing judgment, or patient preference. Implementation followed the Plan-Do-Study-Act quality improvement process and involved written resources and simulation. RESULTS: Evidence supported the use of the dorsogluteal site in four instances and the importance of education. Nurses were highly satisfied with the education and opportunity to practice their skills with feedback during return demonstration. After studying nurses' follow-up survey results, a refresher simulation and medical center guideline were completed. There were no reports of IM injection patient injuries after 2 years and approximately 768 dorsogluteal and ventrogluteal IM injections in the academic medical center. CONCLUSION: Pursuing recent and possibly overlooked evidence provided guidance in supporting the safe use of the dorsogluteal site for IM injections.",2023,Jun,J Am Psychiatr Nurses Assoc,,,10783903231178556,,10.1177/10783903231178556,37366302,#1150,Kilroy 2023,,,0
Occlusal adjustment of 3-unit tooth-supported fixed dental prostheses fabricated with complete-digital and -analog workflows: A crossover clinical trial.,Karasan D; Sailer I; Lee H; Demir F; Zarauz C; Akca K,"AIM: This prospective crossover clinical trial aimed to compare the complete-digital and -analog workflows in terms of occlusal adjustment of 3-unit tooth-supported fixed dental prostheses, operator, and patient preferences. MATERIALS AND METHOD: This study included twelve patients receiving fourteen 3-unit posterior FDPs. 2 FDPs were made for each restoration site: one fabricated in complete-digital workflow comprising intraoral scan with static bite registration (Trios 3) and a monolithic zirconia FDP (test); the other fabricated in complete-analog workflow comprising conventional impression/face-bow transfer and a porcelain-fused-to-metal FDP (control). The FDPs (n=28) were intraorally/provisionally fixed, and quadrant-like intraoral scans were taken for every FDP before & after their occlusal adjustments. Pre- and post-adjustment scans of each FDP were then superimposed using best-fit alignment (GOM Inspect) to measure the volumetric occlusal adjustment amount (mm(3)) (3Matic) (Mann Whitney U, α=0.05). The patient and operator experience for digital and analog workflows were evaluated using visual analog scales (Wilcoxon test, α=0.05). RESULTS: Mean occlusal adjustments were 7.63 mm(3) [±7.02] and 25.95 mm(3) [±39.61] for test and control groups, respectively. The volumetric adjustment difference was clinically noticeable but not significant (P=0.12). The impression and digital workflow adjustment were perceived more favorably by both operator (P=0.003, P=0.046, respectively) and the patients (P=0.003, P=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this clinical study, the complete digital workflow with digital static bite-registration provided high occlusal accuracy for short-span tooth-supported FDPs. In addition, the patient and operator preferences significantly favored the digital workflow. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Complete-digital workflow employing intraoral scanning and model-free fabrication of monolithic-Zr short-span tooth-supported FDPs offers an effective treatment modality with sufficient occlusal accuracy. Therefore complete-digital workflow is a valid alternative for complete-analog workflow comprising conventional impression, face-bow transfer, and use of a semi-adjustable articulator.",2023,Jan,J Dent,128,,104365,,10.1016/j.jdent.2022.104365,36403691,#1639,Karasan 2023,,,0
Perioperative complications following open or endovascular revascularization for chronic limb-threatening ischemia in the BEST-CLI Trial.,Siracuse JJ; Farber A; Menard MT; Conte MS; Kaufman JA; Jaff M; Kiang SC; Ochoa Chaar CI; Osborne N; Singh N; Tan TW; Guzman RJ; Strong MB; Hamza TH; Doros G; Rosenfield K,"OBJECTIVE: Anticipated perioperative morbidity is an important factor for choosing a revascularization method for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). Our goal was to assess systemic perioperative complications of patients treated with surgical and endovascular revascularization in the Best Endovascular vs Best Surgical Therapy in Patients with CLTI (BEST-CLI) trial. METHODS: BEST-CLI was a prospective randomized trial comparing open (OPEN) and endovascular (ENDO) revascularization strategies for patients with CLTI. Two parallel cohorts were studied: Cohort 1 included patients with adequate single-segment great saphenous vein (SSGSV), whereas Cohort 2 included those without SSGSV. Data were queried for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE-composite myocardial infarction, stroke, death), non-serious (non-SAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) (criteria-death/life-threatening/requiring hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization/significant disability/incapacitation/affecting subject safety in trial) 30 days after the procedure. Per protocol analysis was used (intervention received without crossover), and risk-adjusted analysis was performed. RESULTS: There were 1367 patients (662 OPEN, 705 ENDO) in Cohort 1 and 379 patients (188 OPEN, 191 ENDO) in Cohort 2. Thirty-day mortality in Cohort 1 was 1.5% (OPEN 1.8%; ENDO 1.3%) and in Cohort 2 was 1.3% (2.7% OPEN; 0% ENDO). MACE in Cohort 1 was 4.7% for OPEN vs 3.13% for ENDO (P = .14), and in Cohort 2, was 4.28% for OPEN and 1.05% for ENDO (P = .15). On risk-adjusted analysis, there was no difference in 30-day MACE for OPEN vs ENDO for Cohort 1 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-2.64; P = .16) or Cohort 2 (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 0.48-9.88; P = .31). The incidence of acute renal failure was similar across interventions; in Cohort 1 it was 3.6% for OPEN vs 2.1% for ENDO (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.85-3.12; P = .14), and in Cohort 2, it was 4.2% OPEN vs 1.6% ENDO (HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 0.75-10.8; P = .12). The occurrence of venous thromboembolism was low overall and was similar between groups in Cohort 1 (OPEN 0.9%; ENDO 0.4%) and Cohort 2 (OPEN 0.5%; ENDO 0%). Rates of any non-SAEs in Cohort 1 were 23.4% in OPEN and 17.9% in ENDO (P = .013); in Cohort 2, they were 21.8% for OPEN and 19.9% for ENDO (P = .7). Rates for any SAEs in Cohort 1 were 35.3% for OPEN and 31.6% for ENDO (P = .15); in Cohort 2, they were 25.5% for OPEN and 23.6% for ENDO (P = .72). The most common types of non-SAEs and SAEs were infection, procedural complications, and cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS: In BEST-CLI, patients with CLTI who were deemed suitable candidates for open lower extremity bypass surgery had similar peri-procedural complications following either OPEN or ENDO revascularization: In such patients, concern about risk of peri-procedure complications should not be a deterrent in deciding revascularization strategy. Rather, other factors, including effectiveness in restoring perfusion and patient preference, are more relevant.",2023,Oct,J Vasc Surg,78,4,1012-1020.e2,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02060630,10.1016/j.jvs.2023.05.040,37318428,#836,Siracuse 2023,,,0
Abortion terminology preferences: a cross-sectional survey of people accessing abortion care.,Kaller S; Ralph L; Wingo E; Biggs MA,"BACKGROUND: Abortion stigma likely affects the terminology abortion patients, providers and the public use or avoid using to refer to abortion care. Knowing the terminology people seeking abortion prefer could help inform the language used in clinical interactions and improve patients' experiences with abortion care. However, research in the U.S. has not examined patients' preferences in this area or whether terminology preferences vary by participant characteristics, in the way that experiences of stigma vary across different contexts and communities. This study aims to describe preferred terminology among people presenting for abortion care and to explore the pregnancy-related characteristics associated with these preferences. METHODS: We surveyed abortion patients about their experiences accessing abortion care, including preferred terms for the procedure. Respondents could mark more than one term, suggest their own term, or indicate no preference. We recruited people ages 15-45 seeking abortion from four U.S. abortion facilities located in three states (California, Illinois, and New Mexico) from January to June 2019. We used descriptive statistics and multivariable multinomial logistic regression to explore associations between respondents' pregnancy-related characteristics and their preferred terminology. RESULTS: Among the 1092 people approached, 784 (77%) initiated the survey and 697 responded to the terminology preference question. Most participants (57%, n = 400) preferred only one term. Among those participants, ""abortion"" (43%) was most preferred, followed by ""ending a pregnancy"" (29%), and ""pregnancy termination"" (24%). In adjusted multivariable models, participants who worried ""very much"" that other people might find out about the abortion (29%) were significantly more likely than those who were ""not at all"" worried (13%) to prefer ""ending a pregnancy"" over having no preference for a term (adjusted relative risk ratio: 2.68, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.46-4.92). CONCLUSIONS: People seeking abortion have varied preferences for how they want to refer to their abortions, in particular if they anticipate abortion stigma. Findings can be useful for clinicians and researchers so that they can be responsive to people's preferences during clinical interactions and in the design and conduct of abortion research.",2023,Jan,BMC Womens Health,23,1,26,,10.1186/s12905-022-02152-8,36658525,#1585,Kaller 2023,Rosanna Irene Comoretto (2024-04-11 20:40:08)(Screen): people not patients; ,,0

Describing settings of care in the last 100 days of life for cancer decedents: a population-based descriptive study.,Hafid A; Howard M; Webber C; Gayowsky A; Scott M; Jones A; Hsu AT; Tanuseputro P; Downar J; Conen K; Manuel D; Isenberg SR,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have described the settings cancer decedents spend their end-of-life stage, with none considering homecare specifically. We describe the different settings of care experienced in the last 100 days of life by individuals with cancer and how settings of care change as they approached death. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study from January 2013 to December 2017, of decedents whose primary cause of death was cancer, using linked population-level health administrative datasets in Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: Decedents 125,755 were included in our cohort. The average age at death was 73, 46% were female, and 14% resided in rural regions. And 24% died of lung cancer, 7% breast, 7% colorectal, 7% pancreatic, 5% prostate, and 50% other cancers. In the last 100 days of life, decedents spent 25.9 days in institutions, 25.8 days receiving care in the community, and 48.3 days at home without any care. Individuals who died of lung and pancreatic cancers spent the most days at home without any care (52.1 and 52.6 days), while individuals who died of prostate and breast cancer spent the least days at home without any care (41.6 and 45.1 days). Regardless of cancer type, decedents spent fewer days at home and more days in institutions as they approached death, despite established patient preferences for an end-of-life experience at home. CONCLUSIONS: In the last 100 days of life, cancer decedents spent most of their time in either institutions or at home without any care. Improving homecare services during the end-of-life may provide people dying of cancer with a preferred dying experience.",2023,Feb,Cancer Med,12,4,4809-4820,,10.1002/cam4.5291,36281530,#1562,Hafid 2023,,,0
Telehealth Preferences Among Patients With Advanced Cancer in the Post COVID-19 Vaccine Era.,Shih KK; Arechiga AB; Chen X; Urbauer DL; De Moraes AR; Rodriguez AJ; Thomas L; Stanton PA; Bruera E; Hui D,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined patient preferences for telehealth in palliative care after the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. We examined patient preferences for video versus in-person visits and factors contributing to preferences in the postvaccine era. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey of patients who were seen at our palliative care clinic between April 2021 and March 2022. Patients were surveyed directly their preference for either video or in-person visits for outpatient palliative care (primary outcome). We also surveyed preferences including convenience, cost, wait time, and perceptions of COVID-19 safety regarding their palliative virtual-video visit. We examined clinical factors associated with preferences with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: About 200 patients completed the survey. 132 (67%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 60%, 74%) preferred virtual-video, while 16 (8%) preferred in-person visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. About 120 (61%, 95%CI: 54%, 68%) preferred virtual-video after the pandemic. Patients perceived virtual-video favorably regarding travel and related costs (179 [91%]), convenience (175 [88%]), and wait time (136 [69%]). Multivariable analysis showed concerns for catching COVID-19 from healthcare providers (odds ratio [OR]: 4.20; 95%CI: 1.24-14.25; P = 0.02) and feeling comfortable with computers or mobile devices (OR: 4.59; 95%CI: 1.02, 20.60; P = 0.047) were significantly associated with preferring virtual-video. Patients who were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (OR: 0.25; 95%CI: 0.09, 0.71) and had increased dypsnea (OR: 0.74; 95%CI: 0.59, 0.93) were less likely to prefer video over in-person.

Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy European Patient Survey: Assessing Patient Reported Disease Burden and Preferences in Clinical Trial Participation.,McNiff MM; Hawkins S; Haase B; Bullivant J; McIver T; Mitelman O; Emery N; Tasca G; Voermans N; Diaz-Manera J,"BACKGROUND: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness leading to permanent disability. There are no curative treatments, however, there are several upcoming clinical trials testing new therapies in FSHD. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the disease burden and patient preferences of people with FSHD to ensure that clinical trials can be designed to include outcome measures that are relevant and important to patients. METHODS: A survey was developed with a steering committee clinicians and physiotherapists with relevant experience in the disease, patient representatives, a registry expert and industry consultants. Themes of the survey included; participant demographics, disease progression and impact on function, factors encouraging or discouraging clinical trial participation, and positive outcomes of a clinical trial. RESULTS: 1147 participants responded to the online survey, representing 26 countries across Europe and a range of disease severities. The study highlighted the key symptoms causing concern for FSHD patients - muscle weakness and mobility issues - reflecting what participants want targeted for future therapies. The need for clear information and communication throughout clinical trials was emphasised. Factors most encouraging trial participation included access to new investigational therapies, access to trial results and benefits for the FSHD community. Factors most discouraging trial participation included travel related issues and fear of side effects.

Exploration of patients' preference for modalities of care among peritoneal dialysis patients in Singapore: a single-center experience.,Htay H; Foo MWY; Jayaballa M; Lim LWW; Oei EL; Sim MH; Teo XX; Wong FMF; Wu SY; Yu PPY; Tan CS,"INTRODUCTION: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is home-based dialysis therapy and therefore a suitable modality for kidney failure patients, particularly, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study examined patients' preferences for different PD-related services. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey study. Anonymized data from PD patients followed up at a single center in Singapore were collected using an online platform. The study focused on telehealth services, home visits, and monitoring of quality-of-life (QoL). RESULTS: A total of 78 PD patients responded to the survey. The majority of participants were Chinese (76%), married (73%), and between 45 and 65 years old (45%). The in-person visit was preferred over teleconsultation for consultation with nephrologists (68% versus 32%), counseling for kidney disease and dialysis by renal coordinators (59%), whereas the telehealth service was favored over in-person visit for dietary counseling (60%) and medication counseling (64%). Most participants (81%) preferred medication delivery over self-collection, and the acceptable turnaround time was 1 week. Sixty percent would like to have a regular home visit, but 23% refused such visits. The preferred frequency of home visits was one-to-three visits within the first 6 months (74%) and then 6 monthly for subsequent visits (40%). The majority of participants (87%) agreed with QoL monitoring, and the preferred frequency of monitoring varied between 6 monthly (45%) and yearly (40%). Participants also indicated three key areas in research to improve QoL, such as the development of artificial kidneys, portable PD devices, and simplification of PD procedure. Participants also would like to see improvement in two main areas of PD services, such as delivery service for PD solutions and social (instrumental, informational, and emotional) support. CONCLUSIONS: Most PD patients preferred in-person visits with nephrologists or renal coordinators; however, they favored telehealth services with dieticians and pharmacists. PD patients also welcomed home visit service and QoL monitoring. Future studies should confirm these findings.",2024,Jan,Int Urol Nephrol,56,1,199-204,,10.1007/s11255-023-03605-1,37204677,#536,Htay 2024,,,0
"Understanding Patient Perspectives on Specialized, Longitudinal, Postpartum, Cardiovascular Risk-Reduction Clinics.",Nix KM; Lee-Ann Hawkins T; Vlasschaert M; Ma IWY; Nerenberg KA,"BACKGROUND: Females who experience hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) have an increased lifelong risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, Canadian clinical practice guidelines recommend cardiovascular risk reduction follow-up after a patient has HDP. This study examined the experiences of patients with HDP who attended a specialized, longitudinal general internal medicine postpartum cardiovascular risk reduction clinic called PreVASC. PreVASC focuses on comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction through cardiovascular risk factor screening and management tailored specifically for female patients after they have HDP. METHODS: This multimethod study examined the experiences of female patients with HDP via the following: (i) a quantitative survey (summarized with descriptive statistics); (ii) semistructured qualitative patient phone interviews (results grouped thematically); and (iii) triangulation of qualitative themes with quantitative survey results. RESULTS: Overall, 37% of eligible clinic patients (42 of 115) participated; 79% of participants (n = 33) reported being ""very satisfied"" with the PreVASC clinic's specialized longitudinal model of care, and 95% (n = 40) reported making at least one preventive health behaviour change after receiving individualized counselling on cardiovascular risk reduction. Qualitative results found improvements in patient-reported cardiovascular health knowledge, health behaviours, and health-related anxiety. A preference for in-person vs phone clinic visits was reported by participants. CONCLUSIONS: An in-person, general internal medicine specialist-led, longitudinal model of cardiovascular disease preventive care focused specifically on cardiovascular risk reduction after HDP had positive impacts on patient experience, health knowledge, and preventive health behaviours. This novel knowledge on patient preferences for a longitudinal, specialized model of care advances cardiovascular risk reduction tailored specifically for high-risk people after HDP.",2024,Feb,CJC Open,6,2Part B,165-173,,10.1016/j.cjco.2023.09.020,38487052,#398,Nix 2024,,,0
Individual Patient Factors Associated with the Use of Physical or Digital Primary Care in Sweden.,Söderberg D; Bonn SE; Sjöblom L; Dahlgren A; Muli I; Amer-Wåhlin I; Bertilson BC; Farrokhnia N; Hvitfeldt H; Taloyan M; Hägglund M; Trolle Lagerros Y,"Introduction: Little is known about factors that influence patients' choice to use physical or digital primary care. This study aimed to compare self-rated health, internet habits, and what patients deem important when choosing health care between users of physical and digital primary health care. Methods: We recruited 2,716 adults visiting one of six physical or four digital primary health care providers in Stockholm, Sweden, October 2020 to May 2021. Participants answered a questionnaire with questions about sociodemography, self-rated health, internet habits, and what they considered important when seeking care. We used logistic regression and estimated odds ratios (ORs) for choosing digital care. Results: Digital users considered themselves healthier and used the internet more, compared with physical users (p < 0.001). Competence of health care staff was the most important factor when seeking care to both physical and digital users (90% and 78%, respectively). Patients considering it important to avoid leaving home were more likely to seek digital care (OR 29.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.65-69.06), while patients valuing continuity were more likely to seek physical care (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.19-0.32). These factors were significant also when adjusting for self-rated health and sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusion: What patients considered important when seeking health care was associated with what type of care they sought. Patient preferences should be considered when planning health care to optimize resource allocation.",2024,Feb,Telemed J E Health,,,,,10.1089/tmj.2023.0351,38394275,#391,Söderberg 2024,,,0
Urethral Bulking With Polyacrylamide Hydrogel Compared With Other Treatments for Stress Urinary Incontinence: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.,Chang OH; Shepherd JP; Cadish LA; Wallace SL; St Martin B; Sokol ER,"Our objective was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing polyacrylamide hydrogel urethral bulking with other surgical and nonsurgical treatments for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). We created a cost-effectiveness analysis using TreeAge Pro, modeling eight SUI treatments. Treatment with midurethral sling (MUS) had the highest effectiveness (1.86 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), followed by polyacrylamide hydrogel (1.82 QALYs), with a difference (Δ 0.02/year) less than the minimally important difference for utilities of 0.03 annually. When the proportion of polyacrylamide hydrogel urethral bulking procedures performed in the office setting is greater than 58%, polyacrylamide hydrogel is a cost-effective treatment for SUI, along with pessary, pelvic floor physical therapy, and MUS. Although MUS is more effective and, therefore, the preferred SUI treatment, polyacrylamide hydrogel is a reasonable alternative depending on patient preferences and treatment goals.",2024,Mar,Obstet Gynecol,143,3,428-430,,10.1097/AOG.0000000000005503,38207326,#293,Chang 2024,,,0
Patient preferences and cost-benefit of hypertension and hyperlipidemia collaborative management model between pharmacies and primary care in Portugal: A discrete choice experiment alongside a trial (USFarmácia®).,Costa S; Guerreiro J; Teixeira I; Helling DK; Mateus C; Pereira J,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about patient preferences and the value of pharmacy-collaborative disease management with primary care using technology-driven interprofessional communication under real-world conditions. Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) are useful for quantifying preferences for non-market services. OBJECTIVES: 1) To explore variation in patient preferences and estimate willingness-to-accept annual cost to the National Health Service (NHS) for attributes of a collaborative intervention trial between pharmacies and primary care using a trial exit DCE interview; 2) to incorporate a DCE into an economic evaluation using cost-benefit analysis (CBA). METHODS: We performed a DCE telephone interview with a sample of hypertension and hyperlipidemia trial patients 12 months after trial onset. We used five attributes (levels): waiting time to get urgent/not urgent medical appointment (7 days/45 days; 48 hrs./30 days; same day/15 days), model of pharmacy intervention (5-min. counter basic check; 15-min. office every 3 months for BP and medication review of selected medicines; 30-min. office every 6 months for comprehensive measurements and medication review of all medicines), integration with primary care (weak; partial; full), chance of having a stroke in 5 years (same; slightly lower; much lower), and annual cost to the NHS (0€; 30€; 51€; 76€). We used an experimental orthogonal fractional factorial design. Data were analyzed using conditional logit. We subtracted the estimated annual incremental trial costs from the mean WTA (Net Benefit) for CBA. RESULTS: A total of 122 patients completed the survey. Waiting time to get medical appointment-on the same day (urgent) and within 15 days (non-urgent)-was the most important attribute, followed by 30-minute pharmacy intervention in private office every 6 months for point-of-care measurements and medication review of all medicines, and full integration with primary care. The cost attribute was not significant. Intervention patients were willing to accept the NHS annual cost of €877 for their preferred scenario. The annual net benefit per patient is €788.20 and represents the monetary value of patients' welfare surplus for this model. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first conducted in Portugal alongside a pharmacy collaborative trial, incorporating DCE into CBA. The findings can be used to guide the design of pharmacy collaborative interventions with primary care with the potential for reimbursement for uncontrolled or at-risk chronic disease patients informed by patient preferences. Future DCE studies conducted in community pharmacy may provide additional contributions.

Physical Activity Preferences of People Living with Brain Injury: Formative Qualitative Research to Develop a Discrete Choice Experiment.,Haynes A; Howard K; Johnson L; Williams G; Clanchy K; Tweedy S; Scheinberg A; Chagpar S; Wang B; Vassallo G; Ashpole R; Sherrington C; Hassett L,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization physical activity guidelines for people living with disability do not consider the needs of people living with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury. This paper describes the qualitative co-development of a discrete choice experiment survey to inform the adaption of these guidelines by identifying the physical activity preferences of people living with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury in Australia. METHODS: The research team comprised researchers, people with lived experience of traumatic brain injury and health professionals with expertise in traumatic brain injury. We followed a four-stage process: (1) identification of key constructs and initial expression of attributes, (2) critique and refinement of attributes, (3) prioritisation of attributes and refinement of levels and (4) testing and refining language, format and comprehensibility. Data collection included deliberative dialogue, focus groups and think-aloud interviews with 22 purposively sampled people living with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury. Strategies were used to support inclusive participation. Analysis employed qualitative description and framework methods. RESULTS: This formative process resulted in discarding, merging, renaming and reconceptualising attributes and levels. Attributes were reduced from an initial list of 17 to six: (1) Type of activity, (2) Out-of-pocket cost, (3) Travel time, (4) Who with, (5) Facilitated by and (6) Accessibility of setting. Confusing terminology and cumbersome features of the survey instrument were also revised. Challenges included purposive recruitment, reducing diverse stakeholder views to a few attributes, finding the right language and navigating the complexity of discrete choice experiment scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: This formative co-development process significantly improved the relevance and comprehensibility of the discrete choice experiment survey tool. This process may be applicable in other discrete choice experiment studies.",2023,Jul,Patient,16,4,385-398,,10.1007/s40271-023-00628-9,37204699,#1111,Haynes 2023,,,1
Roadmap for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension in the Middle East: Review of the 2022 EVIDENT Summit.,Al Saleh Y; Al Busaidi N; Al Dahi W; Almajnoni M; Mohammed AS; Alshali K; Al-Shamiri M; Al Sifri S; Arafah M; Chan SP; El-Tamimi H; Hafidh K; Hassanein M; Shaaban A; Sultan A; Grassi G,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension are leading risk factors for death and disability in the Middle East. Both conditions are highly prevalent, underdiagnosed and poorly controlled, highlighting an urgent need for a roadmap to overcome the barriers to optimal glycaemic and blood pressure management in this region. This review provides a summary of the Evidence in Diabetes and Hypertension Summit (EVIDENT) held in September 2022, which discussed current treatment guidelines, unmet clinical needs and strategies to improve treatment outcomes for patients with T2DM and hypertension in the Middle East. Current clinical guidelines recommend strict glycaemic and blood pressure targets, presenting several treatment options to achieve and maintain these targets and prevent complications. However, treatment targets are infrequently met in the Middle East, largely due to high clinical inertia among physicians and low medication adherence among patients. To address these challenges, clinical guidelines now provide individualised therapy recommendations based on drug profiles, patient preferences and management priorities. Efforts to improve the early detection of prediabetes, T2DM screening and intensive, early glucose control will minimise long-term complications. Physicians can use the T2DM Oral Agents Fact Checking programme to help navigate the wide range of treatment options and guide clinical decision-making. Sulfonylurea agents have been used successfully to manage T2DM; a newer agent, gliclazide MR (modified release formulation), has the advantages of a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia with no risk of cardiovascular events, weight neutrality and proven renal benefits. For patients with hypertension, single-pill combinations have been developed to improve efficacy and reduce treatment burden. In conjunction with pragmatic treatment algorithms and personalised therapies, greater investments in disease prevention, public awareness, training of healthcare providers, patient education, government policies and research are needed to improve the quality of care of patients with T2DM and/or hypertension in the Middle East.",2023,Jul,Adv Ther,40,7,2965-2984,,10.1007/s12325-023-02529-7,37233878,#1106,AlSaleh 2023,,,0
Treatment Algorithm for Management of Benign Prostatic Obstruction: An Overview of Current Techniques.,Hughes T; Harper P; Somani BK,"The management of benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) should involve a treatment algorithm that takes into account prostate size, and patient's symptoms and preference with the aim of helping with urinary symptoms and enhance quality of life. The diagnostic assessment for men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) should be comprehensive to help choose the best management strategy. Strategies from lifestyle modifications to medical treatment with alpha blockers and/or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors to surgical procedures can all be used in the management algorithm. Surgical management ranges from transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) to minimally invasive surgical therapies (MIST) including laser therapies such as Holmium laser enucleation (HoLEP) and photoselective vaporisation (PVP), aquablation, Rezūm system, prostate artery embolisation (PAE), prostatic urethral lift (PUL), temporary implantable nitinol device (iTind) and Optilume BPH catheter system. BPO is a common urological condition that has a significant impact on quality of life and economic burden globally and is likely to become increasingly prevalent with an ageing population. Selecting the most appropriate treatment modality will depend on the individual patient preferences, availability of resources, cost, anatomical factors and the goals of treatment.",2023,Oct,Life (Basel),13,10,,,10.3390/life13102077,37895457,#773,Hughes 2023,,,0
Telemedicine in a spine clinic setting: a large survey of patient preferences and experiences.,Maurer RK; Hallan D; Maurer TC; Lee C; Kelleher JP,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has greatly disturbed healthcare and the practice of neurosurgery. As healthcare systems evolve in the face of COVID-19, the use of telehealth platforms has expanded. We presented the results of a large survey of patient perspectives on the role of telehealth in the care of spine clinic patients. METHODS: All patients at the spine clinic of a large, tertiary, academic medical center were surveyed at their clinic visit from May 30, 2020-June 30, 2020. All responses were anonymous, and results were analyzed with standard statistical techniques. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-six surveys were returned and 164 were entirely completed. 56.8% of patients were new while 24.4% were postoperative follow-up visits: 54.9% had lumbar symptoms. 85% had pain while more than half also reported weakness; 58% traveled greater than twenty-five miles for their appointment; 96% had transportation readily available. Of all respondents, only 15.3% preferred the appointment via video telehealth while 4% had no preference between in-person appointment or virtual visit. Preference for telehealth appointment was not associated with factors such as new or established in the practice, spinal region of symptoms, pain, weakness, comfort with technology, age, or duration of symptoms. There was a significant difference between how far the patient traveled for the clinic appointment and their preference for a telehealth appointment, with patients traveling further distances favoring telehealth (P=0.04). This effect remained significant when stratifying based on 25 miles (P=0.03) or 50 miles (P=0.03) but not when stratifying based on 100 miles (P=0.32). However, the sample size of patients traveling >100 miles was small, limiting any inference regarding that subgroup. Access to transportation was associated with preference for telehealth (88.89% vs. 97.18%, P=0.08) but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Most spine patients prefer in-person clinic appointments to virtual appointments. These preferences should be considered when arranging patient encounters.",2023,Jun,J Neurosurg Sci,67,3,351-354,,10.23736/S0390-5616.20.05220-0,33393750,#1223,Maurer 2023,,,0
Anticoagulant treatment of cancer-associated thromboembolism.,Mahé I; Mayeur D; Couturaud F; Scotté F; Benhamou Y; Benmaziane A; Bertoletti L; Laporte S; Girard P; Mismetti P; Sanchez O,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent and potentially fatal complication in patients with cancer. During the initial period after the thromboembolic event, a patient receiving anticoagulant treatment is exposed both to a risk of VTE recurrence and also to an elevated bleeding risk conferred by the treatment. For this reason, the choice of anticoagulant is critical. The choice should take into account patient-related factors (such as functional status, age, body mass index, platelet count and renal function), VTE-related factors (such as severity or site), cancer-related factors (such as activity and progression) and treatment-related factors (such as drug-drug interactions), which all potentially influence bleeding risk, and patient preference. These should be evaluated carefully for each patient during a multidisciplinary team meeting. For most patients, apixaban or a low molecular-weight heparin is the most appropriate initial choice for anticoagulant treatment. Such treatment should be offered to all patients with active cancer for at least six months. The patient and treatment should be re-evaluated regularly and anticoagulant treatment changed when necessary. Continued anticoagulant treatment beyond six months is justified if the cancer remains active or if the patient experienced recurrence of VTE in the first six months. In other cases, the interest of continued anticoagulant treatment may be considered on an individual patient basis in collaboration with oncologists.",2024,Jan,Arch Cardiovasc Dis,117,1,29-44,,10.1016/j.acvd.2023.11.010,38092578,#509,Mahé 2024,,,0

What landscape elements are needed for hospital healing spaces? Evidence from an empirical study of 10 compact hospitals.,Guo H; Zhou W; Lai W; Yao L,"BACKGROUND: Modern medical research shows that a rationally planned landscape environment helps patients recover. With the growing number of hospital patients and the tightening of per capita medical landscape land, the use of limited landscape resources to serve patients has become challenging. METHODS: This study focused on the landscape environment of 10 hospitals in Guangdong Province, China. Based on the KANO theoretical model, a survey questionnaire was designed and administered to 410 participants. The data were analyzed based on demand attributes, importance, sensitivity, and group differences. RESULTS: The maintenance requirements were the most important item in the sensitivity ranking. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that the users need a safe, quiet, and private environment, owing to their higher requirements, including visual healing, rehabilitation activities, shading and heat preservation, and medical escort. Moreover, adolescents and older adult patients have common and contradictory environmental needs. For example, the landscape environment should provide both an active space and a quiet rehabilitation environment. CONCLUSION: This study evaluates how landscape resources can be better utilized from the perspective of the user and expands the theory of healing landscapes, which has practical implications for hospital renovation and landscape environment strategies.",2023,,Front Public Health,11,,1243582,,10.3389/fpubh.2023.1243582,38074756,#663,Guo 2023,,,0
Intentional replantation and dental autotransplantation of mandibular posterior teeth: Two case reports.,Wang Y; Hofmann M; Ruf S; Zhang J; Huang Q,"BACKGROUND: Intentional replantation and dental autotransplantation are 2 similar techniques both involving atraumatic tooth extraction, visualization of the root, and replantation. They are considered as the last resort for unsalvageable teeth. The author aims to describe 2 mandibular posterior teeth with serious periapical lesions which are resolved by intentional replantation and dental autotransplantation, respectively. CASE SUMMARY: In case 1, a 45-year-old male patient received root canal treatment because of a cracked mandible right first molar with periapical lesions. An endodontic file was separated in the apical third of the mesiolingual root canal. After conventional canal filling of the other root canals, the molar was atraumatically extracted. The separated instrument was removed, the mesiolingual root received a retrograde filling and the molar was replanted. At the 3-month follow up, the patient was asymptomatic and the X-ray picture showed no detectable root resorption and ankylosis. In case 2, a 29-year-old woman reported discomfort during occlusal loading after a root canal treatment and a coronal restoration of the mandibular right first molar. Radiographs showed a low-density shadow in the mesial apical and in the root furcation area of the mandibular first molar so the patient was diagnosed as chronic periapical periodontitis. After the removal of the affected tooth, the extraction socket was thoroughly debrided and irrigated. The intact mandibular right third molar with similar dimensions was extracted by minimally invasive procedure and transplanted. The donor tooth was fixed by a fiber-splint for 1 month and a root canal treatment was performed 2 weeks after surgery. After 1 year, clinical and radiographical examination revealed functional and periodontal healing. CONCLUSIONS: These 2 reports present the successful management of intentional replantation and dental autotransplantation. Both procedures are recommended after nonsurgical endodontic treatment, especially when apical microsurgery is not an option, for example because of difficult accessibility or patient preference.",2023,Nov,Medicine (Baltimore),102,46,e35822,,10.1097/MD.0000000000035822,37986277,#680,Wang 2023,,,0
American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Practice Guideline: Pharmacological Management of Chronic Idiopathic Constipation.,Chang L; Chey WD; Imdad A; Almario CV; Bharucha AE; Diem S; Greer KB; Hanson B; Harris LA; Ko C; Murad MH; Patel A; Shah ED; Lembo AJ; Sultan S,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is a common disorder associated with significant impairment in quality of life. This clinical practice guideline, jointly developed by the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology, aims to inform clinicians and patients by providing evidence-based practice recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of CIC in adults. METHODS: The American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that conducted systematic reviews of the following agents: fiber, osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol, magnesium oxide, lactulose), stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, senna), secretagogues (lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide), and serotonin type 4 agonist (prucalopride). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to assess the certainty of evidence for each intervention. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop clinical recommendations based on the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 10 recommendations for the pharmacological management of CIC in adults. Based on available evidence, the panel made strong recommendations for the use of polyethylene glycol, sodium picosulfate, linaclotide, plecanatide, and prucalopride for CIC in adults. Conditional recommendations were made for the use of fiber, lactulose, senna, magnesium oxide, and lubiprostone. DISCUSSION: This document provides a comprehensive outline of the various over-the-counter and prescription pharmacological agents available for the treatment of CIC. The guidelines are meant to provide a framework for approaching the management of CIC; clinical providers should engage in shared decision making based on patient preferences as well as medication cost and availability. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted to help guide future research opportunities and enhance the care of patients with chronic constipation.",2023,Jun,Gastroenterology,164,7,1086-1106,,10.1053/j.gastro.2023.03.214,37211380,#1188,Chang 2023,,,0
Current evidence for dietary therapies in irritable bowel syndrome.,Rej A; Penny HA,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet appears to trigger symptoms in the majority of individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and is associated with a reduced quality of life. There has been a recent focus on the role of dietary therapies to manage individuals with IBS. The aim of this review is to discuss the utility of traditional dietary advice (TDA), low-FODMAP diet (LFD) and gluten-free diet (GFD) in IBS. RECENT FINDINGS: Several recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published demonstrating the efficacy of the LFD and GFD in IBS, with the evidence base for TDA being predominantly based on clinical experience, with emerging RCTs evaluating TDA. Only one RCT has been published to date comparing TDA, LFD and GFD head to head, with no difference noted between diets in terms of efficacy. However, TDA has been noted to be more patient-friendly and is commonly implemented as a first-line dietary therapy. SUMMARY: Dietary therapies have been demonstrated to improve symptoms in patients with IBS. In view of insufficient evidence to recommend one diet over another currently, specialist dietetic input in conjunction with patient preference is required to determine implementation of dietary therapies. Novel methods of dietetic delivery are required in view of the lack of dietetic provision to deliver these therapies.",2023,May,Curr Opin Gastroenterol,39,3,219-226,,10.1097/MOG.0000000000000930,36976876,#1277,Rej 2023,,,0
Balancing benefits and risks in lung cancer therapies: patient preferences for lung cancer treatment alternatives.,Oliveri S; Lanzoni L; Veldwijk J; de Wit GA; Petrocchi S; Janssens R; Schoefs E; Smith MY; Smith I; Nackaerts K; Vandevelde M; Louis E; Decaluwé H; De Leyn P; Declerck H; Petrella F; Casiraghi M; Galli G; Garassino MC; Girvalaki C; Huys I; Pravettoni G,"BACKGROUND: In the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) the combination of Immuno- Oncotherapy (IO) and chemotherapy (CT) has been found to be superior to IO or CT alone for patients' survival. Patients and clinicians are confronted with a preference sensitive choice between a more aggressive treatment with a greater negative effect on quality of life versus alternatives that are less effective but have fewer side effects. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to: (a) quantify patients' preferences for relevant attributes related to Immuno-Oncotherapy treatment alternatives, and (b) evaluate the maximum acceptable risk (MAR)/Minimum acceptable benefit (MAB) that patients would accept for treatment alternatives. METHODS: An online preference survey using discrete-choice experiment (DCE) was completed by NSCLC patients from two hospitals in Italy and Belgium. The survey asked patients' preferences for five patient- relevant treatment attributes. The DCE was developed using a Bayesian D-efficient design. DCE analyses were performed using mixed logit models. Information regarding patient demographics, health literacy, locus of control, and quality of life was also collected. RESULTS: 307 patients (158 Italian, 149 Belgian), stage I to IV, completed the survey. Patients preferred treatments with a higher 5-year survival chance as the most important attribute over all the other attributes. Preference heterogeneity for the attribute weights depended on health literacy, patients' age and locus of control. Patients were willing to accept a substantially increased risks of developing side effects in exchange for the slightest increase (1%) in the chance of surviving at least 5 years from the diagnosis of cancer. Similarly, patients were willing to accept a switch in the mode of administration or complete loss of hair to obtain an increase in survival. CONCLUSION: In this study, the proportion of respondents who systematically preferred survival over all other treatment attributes was particularly high. Age, objective health literacy and locus of control accounted for heterogeneity in patients' preferences. Evidence on how NSCLC patients trade between survival and other NSCLC attributes can support regulators and other stakeholders on assessing clinical trial evidence and protocols, based on patients' conditions and socio-demographic parameters.",2023,,Front Psychol,14,,1062830,,10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1062830,37425173,#1156,Oliveri 2023,,,1
Risk Stratification of Cardiovascular Disease according to Age Groups in New Prevention Guidelines: A Review.,Kim KI,"Age is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, most cardiovascular risk prediction models have included age as an independent risk factor. There is much evidence that effective management of cardiovascular risk factors improves clinical outcomes even in older adults. However, there are concerns that intensive treatment for older adults increases the risk of adverse events. For hypertensive patients, intensive blood pressure reduction with combination therapy increases the risk of syncope, acute kidney injury, and falls. Intensive glucose-lowering therapy among older patients with diabetes increases the risk of hypoglycemia or cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that a balanced approach for older adults is required to increase the benefits and decrease the risk of side effects. In contrast to older people, the estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk in young and healthy individuals is low. However, the lifetime cardiovascular risk in these patients is actually high. The 2021 European Society of Cardiology guideline on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice has been published. It proposed a different risk stratification and recommendation for treatment according to age group, based on the concept of avoiding undertreatment in young people and overtreatment in older persons. Although the guideline recommends age-dependent risk stratification, risk categories should not be applied to the mandatory initiation of drug treatment. In all age groups, other factors such as lifetime cardiovascular risk, treatment benefit and harm, comorbidities, frailty, and patient preferences should be considered when managing patients for primary prevention.",2023,May,J Lipid Atheroscler,12,2,96-105,,10.12997/jla.2023.12.2.96,37265845,#1255,Kim 2023,,,0
Assessment of patients' preferences for new anticancer drugs in China: a best-worst discrete choice experiment on three common cancer types.,Feng Z; Meng J; Sun Y; Xie T; Lu W; Wang G; Geng J,"OBJECTIVES: Despite the advancement in anticancer drug therapies, cancer treatment decisions are often complex and preference-sensitive, making them well suited for studying shared decision-making (SDM). Our study aimed to assess preferences for new anticancer drugs among three common types of patients with cancer to inform SDM. DESIGN: We identified five attributes of new anticancer drugs and used a Bayesian-efficient design to generate choice sets for a best-worst discrete choice experiment (BWDCE). The mixed logit regression model was applied to estimate patient-reported preferences for each attribute. The interaction model was used to investigate preference heterogeneity. SETTING: The BWDCE was conducted in Jiangsu province and Hebei province in China. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18 years or older, who had a definite diagnosis of lung cancer, breast cancer or colorectal cancer were recruited. RESULTS: Data from 468 patients were available for analysis. On average, the most valued attribute was the improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (p<0.001). The low incidence of severe to life-threatening side effects, prolonged progression-free survival and the low incidence of mild to moderate side effects were also positive predictors of patients' preferences (p<0.001). Out-of-pocket cost was a negative predictor of their preferences (p<0.001). According to subgroup analysis by type of cancer, the improvement in HRQoL remained the most valuable attribute. However, the relative importance of other attributes varied by type of cancer. Whether patients were newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed cancer cases played a dominant role in the preference heterogeneity within each subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Our study can assist in the implementation of SDM by providing evidence on patients' preferences for new anticancer drugs. Patients should be informed of the multiattribute values of new drugs and encouraged to make decisions reflecting their values.",2023,Jun,BMJ Open,13,6,e072469,,10.1136/bmjopen-2023-072469,37270199,#1170,Feng 2023,,,1
"Contracting retail pharmacies as a source of essential medicines for public sector clients in low- and middle-income countries: a scoping review of key considerations, challenges, and opportunities.",Kaplan WA; Cellini CM; Eghan K; Pilz K; Harrison D; Wirtz VJ,"BACKGROUND: Insurances in high-income countries (HIC) often contract with private community pharmacies to dispense medicines to outpatients. In contrast, dispensing of medicines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) often lacks such contractual arrangements. Furthermore, many LMICs lack sufficient investment in supply chains and financial and human resources to guarantee stock levels and services at public medicine-dispensing institutions. Countries striving to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) can, in principle, incorporate retail pharmacies into their supply chains to expand access to essential medicines (EMs). The objectives of this paper are (a) to identify and analyze key considerations, opportunities and challenges for public payers when contracting out the supply and dispensing of medicines to retail pharmacies and (b) to provide examples of strategies and policies to address these challenges. METHODS: A targeted literature strategy was used to conduct this scoping review. We created an analytical framework of key dimensions: (1) governance (including medicine and pharmacy regulation); (2) contracting (3) reimbursement; (4) medicine affordability (5) equitable access; and (6) quality of care (including 'patient-centered' pharmaceutical care). Using this framework, we selected a mix of three HIC and four LMIC case studies and analyzed the opportunities and challenges encountered when contracting retail pharmacies. RESULTS: From this analysis, we identified a set of opportunities and challenges that should be considered by public payers considering public-private contracting: (1) balancing business viability with medicine affordability; (2) incentivizing equitable access to medicines; (3) ensuring quality of care and delivery of services; (4) ensuring product quality; (5) task-sharing from primary care providers to pharmacies and (6) securing human resources and related capacity constraints to ensure sustainability of the contract. CONCLUSION: Public-private partnerships offer opportunities to improve access to EMs. Nonetheless, managing these agreements is complex and is influenced by a variety of factors. For effective contractual partnerships, a systems approach is needed in which business, industry and regulatory contexts are considered in tandem with the health system. Special attention should be devoted to rapidly changing health contexts and systems, such as changes in patient preferences and market developments brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.",2023,May,J Pharm Policy Pract,16,1,60,,10.1186/s40545-023-00557-w,37131256,#1252,Kaplan 2023,,,0
Avelumab treatment for patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma can be safely stopped after 1 year and a PET/CT-confirmed complete response.,Zijlker LP; Levy S; Wolters W; van Thienen JV; van Akkooi ACJ; Tesselaar MET,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) has shown high response rates, ranging from 33% to 73%. The ideal duration of treatment, however, is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate if avelumab treatment for mMCC can be safely stopped after 1 year of treatment and a complete response (CR) confirmed by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) imaging. METHODS: Patients who received more than one dose of avelumab treatment for mMCC between November 2017 and February 2022 were included in this study. Treatment was discontinued in case of a FDG-PET/CT confirmed CR after 1 year (26 cycles) of avelumab or a CR and unacceptable toxicity earlier. The primary end point was recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were included: 25 (38%) had a FDG-PET/CT-confirmed CR at discontinuation of avelumab. In those 25 patients, reasons for discontinuation of treatment were completion of 1 year of treatment in 13 (52%), toxicity in five (20%), and patient preference in seven (28%). Median duration of treatment in this group was 11 months (interquartile range, 6.1-11.7). Median follow-up was 27 months (interquartile range, 15.8-33.8). The 12-month RFS was 88% (95% CI, 0.74-1) and median RFS was not reached. Two patients (8%) had a recurrence at 4 and 7 months after discontinuation of treatment.

Citizen attitudes to non-treatment decision making: a Norwegian survey.,Wikstøl D; Horn MA; Pedersen R; Magelssen M,"BACKGROUND: Decisions about appropriate treatment at the end of life are common in modern healthcare. Non-treatment decisions (NTDs), comprising both withdrawal and withholding of (potentially) life-prolonging treatment are in principle accepted in Norway. However, in practice they may give rise to significant moral problems for health professionals, patients and next of kin. Here, patient values must be considered. It is relevant to study the moral views and intuitions of the general population on NTDs and special areas of contention such as the role of next of kin in decision-making. METHODS: Electronic survey to members of a nationally representative panel of Norwegian adults. Respondents were presented with vignettes describing patients with disorders of consciousness, dementia, and cancer where patient preferences varied. Respondents answered ten questions about the acceptability of non-treatment decision making and the role of next of kin. RESULTS: We received 1035 complete responses (response rate 40.7%). A large majority, 88%, supported the right of competent patients to refuse treatment in general. When an NTD was in line with the patient's previously expressed preferences, more respondents tended to find NTDs acceptable. More respondents would accept NTDs for themselves than for the vignette patients. In a scenario with an incompetent patient, clear majorities wanted the views of next of kin to be given some but not decisive weight, and more weight if concordant with the patient's wishes. There were, however, large variations in the respondents' views. CONCLUSION: This survey of a representative sample of the Norwegian adult population indicates that attitudes to NTDs are often in line with national laws and guidelines. However, the high variance among the respondents and relatively large weight given to next of kin's views, indicate a need for appropriate dialogue among all stakeholders to prevent conflicts and extra burdens. Furthermore, the emphasis given to previously expressed opinions indicates that advance care planning may increase the legitimacy of NTDs and prevent challenging decision-making processes.",2023,Mar,BMC Med Ethics,24,1,20,,10.1186/s12910-023-00900-5,36890542,#1416,Wikstøl 2023,,,0
Patient preferences for key drivers and facilitators of adoption of mHealth technology to manage depression: A discrete choice experiment.,Simblett SK; Pennington M; Quaife M; Siddi S; Lombardini F; Haro JM; Peñarrubia-Maria MT; Bruce S; Nica R; Zorbas S; Polhemus A; Novak J; Dawe-Lane E; Morris D; Mutepua M; Odoi C; Wilson E; Matcham F; White KM; Hotopf M; Wykes T,"BACKGROUND: In time, we may be able to detect the early onset of symptoms of depression and even predict relapse using behavioural data gathered through mobile technologies. However, barriers to adoption exist and understanding the importance of these factors to users is vital to ensure maximum adoption. METHOD: In a discrete choice experiment, people with a history of depression (N = 171) were asked to select their preferred technology from a series of vignettes containing four characteristics: privacy, clinical support, established benefit and device accuracy (i.e., ability to detect symptoms), with different levels. Mixed logit models were used to establish what was most likely to affect adoption. Sub-group analyses explored effects of age, gender, education, technology acceptance and familiarity, and nationality. RESULTS: Higher level of privacy, greater clinical support, increased perceived benefit and better device accuracy were important. Accuracy was the most important, with only modest compromises willing to be made to increase other factors such as privacy. Established benefit was the least valued of the attributes with participants happy with technology that had possible but unknown benefits. Preferences were moderated by technology acceptance, age, nationality, and educational background. CONCLUSION: For people with a history of depression, adoption of technology may be driven by the desire for accurate detection of symptoms. However, people with lower technology acceptance and educational attainment, those who were younger, and specific nationalities may be willing to compromise on some accuracy for more privacy and clinical support. These preferences should help shape design of mHealth tools.",2023,Jun,J Affect Disord,331,,334-341,,10.1016/j.jad.2023.03.030,36934854,#1162,Simblett 2023,,,1
Transgender Patient Preferences When Discussing Gender in Health Care Settings.,Harner V; Moore M; Casillas B; Chrivoli J; Lopez Olivares A; Harrop E,"IMPORTANCE: Transgender (trans) patients report frequent discriminatory and harmful experiences in health care settings; gender-affirming, competent health care improves trans individuals' health and well-being. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors influencing trans patients' decision-making regarding sharing gender-related information with providers (clinicians, health care organizations, health care systems) and trans patient preferences for gender-related questions, as well as the subsequent impact on health care experiences. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A qualitative, interpretivist phenomenological study was conducted via telephone or video (using Zoom) in English and Spanish from August 10 to September 11, 2020. Participants were recruited via trans-specific social media groups and email listservs. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed from October 2020 to January 2022 using thematic analysis by a majority trans research team. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Semistructured interviews explored patient health care experiences and preferences. RESULTS: Participants included 27 trans and/or nonbinary adults (mean [SD] age, 30.9 [10.4] years; range, 21-69 years) from 13 US states. Four themes were identified: (1) impact of provider behaviors, (2) engaging in relational risk assessment, (3) receiving affirming vs medically competent care, and (4) ""how are you going to fit [me] into your system?"" The first theme reflected the impact of provider actions, including level of flexibility in care and interpersonal interactions, ability to explain medical relevance of gender-related questions, and preparedness to work with trans patients. Second, respondents weighed a variety of implicit or explicit safety cues when deciding whether and how to share information with providers. Third, participants spoke at length about affirming and medically competent care, noting that they have had to prioritize one over the other. Last, participants reported their needs often being at odds with health care system norms and standards of care. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this qualitative study of trans patient preferences when discussing gender-related information with providers, it was found that equitable, gender-affirming, and competent health care requires flexibility and responsiveness to patient preferences. It requires provider humility and engagement, as well as institutional policies that support competent and gender-affirming spaces. Future research could identify additional roles that providers, administrators, and systems can play in ensuring competent care for trans patients.",2024,Feb,JAMA Netw Open,7,2,e2356604,,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.56604,38372999,#392,Harner 2024,,,0
A Randomized Clinical Trial of Clinician-Supported PTSD Coach in VA Primary Care Patients.,Possemato K; Johnson E; Barrie K; Ghaus S; Noronha D; Wade M; Greenbaum MA; Rosen C; Cloitre M; Owen J; Jain S; Beehler G; Prins A; Seal K; Kuhn E,"BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in primary care patients; however, evidence-based treatments are typically only available in specialty mental healthcare settings and often not accessed. OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of a brief primary care-based treatment, Clinician-Supported PTSD Coach (CS PTSD Coach) was compared with Primary Care Mental Health Integration-Treatment as Usual (PCMHI-TAU) in (1) reducing PTSD severity, (2) engaging veterans in specialty mental health care, and (3) patient satisfaction with care. DESIGN: Multi-site randomized pragmatic clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 234 veterans with PTSD symptoms who were not currently accessing PTSD treatment. INTERVENTION: CS PTSD Coach was designed to be implemented in Veterans Affairs PCMHI and combines mental health clinician support with the ""PTSD Coach"" mobile app. Four 30-min sessions encourage daily use of symptom management strategies. MAIN MEASURES: PTSD severity was measured by clinician-rated interviews pre- and post-treatment (8 weeks). Self-report measures assessed PTSD, depression, and quality of life at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 16- and 24-week follow-ups, and patient satisfaction at post-treatment. Mental healthcare utilization was extracted from medical records. KEY RESULTS: Clinician-rated PTSD severity did not differ by condition at post-treatment. CS PTSD Coach participants improved more on patient-reported PTSD severity at post-treatment than TAU participants (D = .28, p = .021). Coach participants who continued to have problematic PTSD symptoms at post-treatment were not more likely to engage in 2 sessions of specialty mental health treatment than TAU participants. Coach participants engaged in 74% more sessions in the intervention and reported higher treatment satisfaction than TAU participants (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: A structured 4-session intervention designed to align with patient preferences for care resulted in more patient-reported PTSD symptom relief, greater utilization of mental health treatment, and overall treatment satisfaction than TAU, but not more clinician-rated PTSD symptom relief or engagement in specialty mental health.",2023,Jul,J Gen Intern Med,38,Suppl 3,905-912,,10.1007/s11606-023-08130-6,36932268,#1129,Possemato 2023,,,0
Preferences for Treatments for Major Depressive Disorder: Formative Qualitative Research Using the Patient Experience.,dosReis S; Bozzi LM; Butler B; Xie RZ; Chapman RH; Bright J; Malik E; Slejko JF,"OBJECTIVES: The goals of this formative research are to elicit attributes of treatment and desired outcomes that are important to individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), to develop a stated preference instrument, and to pre-test the instrument. METHODS: A three-phase survey study design elicited the patient's journey with MDD to design and pre-test the discrete choice experiment (DCE) instrument. Participants were 20 adults aged ≥ 18 with MDD who did not also have bipolar disorder or post-partum depression. We engaged patient advocates and a multi-disciplinary stakeholder advisory group to select and refine attributes for inclusion in a DCE instrument. The DCE was incorporated into a survey that also collected depression treatment and management and sociodemographic characteristics. The DCE was pre-tested with ten adults with MDD. RESULTS: Six attributes were included in the DCE: mode of treatment (medicine only, psychotherapy only, all modalities including brain stimulation), time to treatment effect (6, 9, 12 weeks), days of hopefulness (2, 4, 6 days/week), effect on productivity (40%, 60%, 90% increase), relations with others (strained, improved, no impact), and out-of-pocket costs ($30, $60, $90/month). The DCE test led to the refinement of mode of treatment (medicine, medicine and psychotherapy, and all modalities); time to treatment effect (4, 6, 9 weeks); monthly out-of-pocket costs ($30, $90, $270). CONCLUSIONS: MDD treatment preferences revealed trade-offs among mode of treatment, time to treatment effect, functional outcomes, and cost.

Multivessel Disease.,Gul F; Parekh A,"A coronary artery is a well-developed trilaminar structure. The innermost layer is termed the tunica intima, which is lined with endothelial cells that make contact with the circulating arterial blood. The endothelial cells have a tightly regulated vascular homeostasis mechanism, failure of which leads to atherosclerotic disease process. Multivessel disease is defined as significant stenosis (>70%) in two or more major coronary arteries of 2.5 mm diameter or more. About 40% to 50% of patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have multivessel coronary disease. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been primarily used for revascularization of complex coronary artery disease (CAD) since 1968. When percutaneous intervention (PCI) was introduced in 1977, it was initially considered a treatment option for patients with single-vessel disease. Advancements in cardiothoracic surgical techniques with the utilization of smaller incisions, arterial conduits, off-pump CABG, and improved postoperative care have led to a reduction in morbidity and mortality and is the preferred revascularization method for multivessel disease. Recent technological and technical advancement in PCI techniques has broadened the treatment scope to now include patients with multivessel disease. Regardless of which modality is chosen, an interprofessional approach should be undertaken and account for various factors, including patient preference, surgical risk, and operator skill.",2024,Jan,,,,,,,32491818,#543,Gul 2024,,,0
Flexor Injury Rehabilitation Splint Trial (FIRST): protocol for a pragmatic randomised controlled trial comparing three splints for finger flexor tendon repairs.,Bamford E; Berntsson H; Beale S; Desoysa L; Dias J; Hamer-Kiwacz S; Hind D; Johnson N; Loban A; Molloy K; Morvan E; Rombach I; Selby A; Thokala P; Turtle C; Walters S; Drummond A,"BACKGROUND: Without surgical repair, flexor tendon injuries do not heal and patients' ability to bend fingers and grip objects is impaired. However, flexor tendon repair surgery also requires optimal rehabilitation. There are currently three custom-made splints used in the rehabilitation of zone I/II flexor tendon repairs, each with different assumed harm/benefit profiles: the dorsal forearm and hand-based splint (long), the Manchester short splint (short), and the relative motion flexion splint (mini). There is, however, no robust evidence as to which splint, if any, is most clinical or cost effective. The Flexor Injury Rehabilitation Splint Trial (FIRST) was designed to address this evidence gap. METHODS: FIRST is a parallel group, superiority, analyst-blind, multi-centre, individual participant-randomised controlled trial. Participants will be assigned 1:1:1 to receive either the long, short, or mini splint. We aim to recruit 429 participants undergoing rehabilitation following zone I/II flexor tendon repair surgery. Potential participants will initially be identified prior to surgery, in NHS hand clinics across the UK, and consented and randomised at their splint fitting appointment post-surgery. The primary outcome will be the mean post-randomisation score on the patient-reported wrist and hand evaluation measure (PRWHE), assessed at 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks post randomisation. Secondary outcome measures include blinded grip strength and active range of movement (AROM) assessments, adverse events, adherence to the splinting protocol (measured via temperature sensors inserted into the splints), quality of life assessment, and further patient-reported outcomes. An economic evaluation will assess the cost-effectiveness of each splint, and a qualitative sub-study will evaluate participants' preferences for, and experiences of wearing, the splints. Furthermore, a mediation analysis will determine the relationship between patient preferences, splint adherence, and splint effectiveness. DISCUSSION: FIRST will compare the three splints with respect to clinical efficacy, complications, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. FIRST is a pragmatic trial which will recruit from 26 NHS sites to allow findings to be generalisable to current clinical practice in the UK. It will also provide significant insights into patient experiences of splint wear and how adherence to splinting may impact outcomes.

Adequate menstrual suppression in adolescents with inherited bleeding disorders often requires multiple treatment changes: Retrospective cohort study of a multidisciplinary clinic.,Brown MC; Tickle K; Woods K; Sidonio RF,"Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is often the presenting symptom for females with inherited bleeding disorders (IBD). Multidisciplinary clinics leverage the expertise of hematologists and women's health specialists. This study characterizes the complexity of HMB management for adolescents with IBDs from a large multidisciplinary clinic. Adolescents often required multiple different menstrual suppression treatments, with only about 20% achieving acceptable suppression with their first treatment. Adolescents switched therapy most often for uncontrolled bleeding, followed by adverse effects, and patient preference. Given the difficulty in achieving adequate menstrual suppression, multidisciplinary clinics offer necessary expertise in accomplishing bleeding control with minimal adverse effects.",2024,Mar,Pediatr Blood Cancer,,,e30944,,10.1002/pbc.30944,38462776,#252,Brown 2024,,,0
Enteroscopy versus Video Capsule Endoscopy for Automatic Diagnosis of Small Bowel Disorders-A Comparative Analysis of Artificial Intelligence Applications.,Popa SL; Stancu B; Ismaiel A; Turtoi DC; Brata VD; Duse TA; Bolchis R; Padureanu AM; Dita MO; Bashimov A; Incze V; Pinna E; Grad S; Pop AV; Dumitrascu DI; Munteanu MA; Surdea-Blaga T; Mihaileanu FV,"BACKGROUND: Small bowel disorders present a diagnostic challenge due to the limited accessibility of the small intestine. Accurate diagnosis is made with the aid of specific procedures, like capsule endoscopy or double-ballon enteroscopy, but they are not usually solicited and not widely accessible. This study aims to assess and compare the diagnostic effectiveness of enteroscopy and video capsule endoscopy (VCE) when combined with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for the automatic detection of small bowel diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an extensive literature search for relevant studies about AI applications capable of identifying small bowel disorders using enteroscopy and VCE, published between 2012 and 2023, employing PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Embase, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. RESULTS: Our investigation discovered a total of 27 publications, out of which 21 studies assessed the application of VCE, while the remaining 6 articles analyzed the enteroscopy procedure. The included studies portrayed that both investigations, enhanced by AI, exhibited a high level of diagnostic accuracy. Enteroscopy demonstrated superior diagnostic capability, providing precise identification of small bowel pathologies with the added advantage of enabling immediate therapeutic intervention. The choice between these modalities should be guided by clinical context, patient preference, and resource availability. Studies with larger sample sizes and prospective designs are warranted to validate these results and optimize the integration of AI in small bowel diagnostics. CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis demonstrates that both enteroscopy and VCE with AI augmentation exhibit comparable diagnostic performance for the automatic detection of small bowel disorders.",2023,Nov,Biomedicines,11,11,,,10.3390/biomedicines11112991,38001991,#690,Popa 2023,,,0
Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection Versus Surgery or Endoscopic Mucosal Resection for Metachronous Early Gastric Cancer: a Meta-analysis.,Meng ZW; Bishay K; Vaska M; Ruan Y; Al-Haddad MA; Elhanafi SE; Qumseya BJ; Belletrutti PJ; Gill R; Debru E; Heitman SJ; Brenner DR; Forbes N,"BACKGROUND: Resection options for early gastric cancer (EGC) include endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), and surgery. In patients with metachronous EGC following previous resection, the optimal resection technique is not well elucidated. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing ESD to EMR, or ESD to surgery, in patients with metachronous EGC. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of studies reporting on outcomes and AEs following ESD versus either EMR or surgery for patients with metachronous EGC. Pooled odds ratios (OR) of included studies were obtained using DerSimonian and Laird random effects models. Funnel plots were produced and visually inspected for evidence of publication bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS: A total of 9367 abstracts were screened and 10 observational studies were included. The odds of complete resection were higher amongst patients undergoing ESD compared to EMR (OR 5.88, 95% confidence intervals, CI, 1.79-19.35), whereas the odds of complete resection were no different between ESD and surgery (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.04-8.24). There were no differences in the odds of local recurrence with ESD versus surgery (OR 5.01, 95% CI 0.86-29.13). Post-procedural bleeding did not differ significantly between ESD and EMR (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.16-3.00). There was no evidence of publication bias. DISCUSSION: For metachronous EGC, ESD or surgery is preferred over EMR depending on local expertise and patient preferences, largely due to a higher risk of incomplete resection with EMR.

Telehealth Access and Substitution in the VHA.,Lum J; Sadej I; Pizer SD; Yee C,"BACKGROUND: In response to COVID-19, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) expanded telehealth availability, allowing veterans to receive care at home. We explore the extent of substitution of telehealth for in-person care among medical centers (facilities), providers, and patients. We explore the extent to which patient preferences drive telehealth utilization, and compare access to care (as measured by waiting times) for telehealth and in-person visits. METHODS: We use VHA electronic health records to identify scheduled outpatient mental health (MH) appointments from January 2019 through February 2023 focusing on care delivered by social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists. For each quarter, we compute the proportion of completed appointments that were delivered via phone or video by each facility, provider, and patient and show the changes in these proportions before, during, and after the onset of COVID-19. To explore patient preferences, we match providers of patients with high rates of telehealth utilization and examine the extent to which those providers deliver in-person care. To examine access to care, we compute waiting times for in-person, video, and phone new patient appointments. We investigate differences between urban and rural patients, and patients of different ages. KEY RESULTS: Telehealth for MH grew dramatically in the VHA after the onset of COVID-19. While some facilities provided more telehealth than others, all facilities (as of early 2023) provided some telehealth MH services. Approximately 86% of individual providers provided telehealth, with 27% scheduling MH appointments almost exclusively as telehealth appointments and 59% providing a mix. Patients exhibited more polarization, with 36% scheduling only in-person visits for almost all their MH visits and 56% of them scheduling exclusively telehealth, and only 8% of them utilizing a mix of modalities. Of those who exclusively received telehealth care, a majority of them utilized video (80%) over phone (20%). Take-up of MH among younger patients was higher relative to older patients. Urban patients used telehealth more than rural patients. Patient preferences rather than provider preferences drove utilization of patients who almost exclusively utilized telehealth. Between April 2021 and February 2023, the average difference in waiting time for in-person and video appointments was less than 1 day, with comparable appointment volumes, suggesting that the supply of and demand for in-person and video were not different enough to merit waiting longer. Telehealth was chosen over in-person more among urban and younger patients, as older and rural patients exhibited higher willingness to wait for in-person over video appointments. By contrast, appointment volumes and waiting times for phone appointments were lower across all groups, suggesting that phone may not be as substitutable for in-person visits in MH. CONCLUSIONS: We find that the VHA has made telehealth widely available, providing access to many veterans. While telehealth utilization has increased, face-to-face care persists for MH services, suggesting that one modality may not serve all purposes and preferences for care. Patient preferences drive the modality decision among those who exclusively use MH care via telehealth. For those who persist in mostly utilizing in-person care, there may be various factors influencing those preferences such as issues with limited internet connectivity, language barriers, and digital literacy, especially for older and rural patients who utilize in-person care more than those who are younger and more urban. Further investigation is required to investigate the optimal mix of modalities which may allow for potential increases in patient satisfaction, quality of care, and clinic efficiency.",2024,Feb,J Gen Intern Med,39,Suppl 1,44-52,,10.1007/s11606-023-08465-0,38393611,#400,Lum 2024,,,0

Among available techniques, wire-guided localization (WGL) is most commonly used. Other techniques (radioactive, magnetic, radar or radiofrequency-based, and intraoperative ultrasound) have been developed in the last two decades with the aim of improving outcomes and logistics. METHODS: We performed a systematic review on localization techniques for non-palpable breast cancer. RESULTS: For most techniques, oncological outcomes such as lesion identification and clear margin rate seem either comparable with or better than for WGL, but evidence is limited to small cohort studies for some of the devices. Intraoperative ultrasound is associated with significantly higher negative margin rates in meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Radioactive techniques were studied in several RCTs and are non-inferior to WGL. Smaller studies show higher patient preference towards wire-free localization, but little is known about surgeons' and radiologists' attitudes towards these techniques.

Knee Cartilage Lesion Management-Current Trends in Clinical Practice.,Jarecki J; Waśko MK; Widuchowski W; Tomczyk-Warunek A; Wójciak M; Sowa I; Blicharski T,"Many patients, particularly those aged above 40, experience knee joint pain, which hampers both sports activities and daily living. Treating isolated chondral and osteochondral defects in the knee poses a significant clinical challenge, particularly in younger patients who are not typically recommended partial or total knee arthroplasty as alternatives. Several surgical approaches have been developed to address focal cartilage defects. The treatment strategies are characterized as palliation (e.g., chondroplasty and debridement), repair (e.g., drilling and microfracture), or restoration (e.g., autologous chondrocyte implantation, osteochondral autograft, and osteochondral allograft). This review offers an overview of the commonly employed clinical methods for treating articular cartilage defects, with a specific focus on the clinical trials conducted in the last decade. Our study reveals that, currently, no single technology fully meets the essential requirements for effective cartilage healing while remaining easily applicable during surgical procedures. Nevertheless, numerous methods are available, and the choice of treatment should consider factors such as the location and size of the cartilage lesion, patient preferences, and whether it is chondral or osteochondral in nature. Promising directions for the future include tissue engineering, stem cell therapies, and the development of pre-formed scaffolds from hyaline cartilage, offering hope for improved outcomes.",2023,Oct,J Clin Med,12,20,,,10.3390/jcm12206434,37892577,#781,Jarecki 2023,,,0
Investigation of predictors influencing patient-pharmacist relationship establishment.,Adekunle OA; Olson AW; Schommer JC; Brown LM,"BACKGROUND: A strong patient-pharmacist relationship is tied to patients' trust and confidence in pharmacists and pharmacy services. While past research has described patient-pharmacist relationship archetypes (i.e., ""customer,"" ""client,"" ""partner"") with potential to help pharmacists initially understand patients' preferences and expectations of care and services, little is known about potential factors that underlie these preferences and expectations. OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to [1] compare the prevalence of the current and desired patient-pharmacist relationships archetypes reported by patients and [2] identify the sociodemographic, health, and medication use and procurement factors predictive of the archetypes representing patients' current relationship with outpatient pharmacists. METHODS: Data from 1521 patients were collected via the 2021 National Consumer Survey on Medication Experience and Pharmacists' Role. Patient-pharmacist relationship distribution across patients' sociodemographic characteristics was explored using crosstabulations. Multinomial logistic regression was also used to investigate the association between patient sociodemographic characteristics and the current patient-pharmacist archetype relationships. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 53.9 years and 57.3% were married. Thirty-two percent of the patients reported currently having a ""Customer"" relationship, while 17.9% and 15.2% reported having a ""Client"" and ""Partner"" archetype relationship, respectively. ""Client"" (25.2%) and ""Partner"" (20.2%) relationships were the most commonly preferred archetypal relationships. The odds ratios (OR) of having ""Client"" or ""Partner"" relationships increased with the number of patients' health conditions and medications. Patients who visited independently owned and clinic pharmacies had a higher OR of building professional relationships with a pharmacist.

A qualitative study on people with opioid use disorders' perspectives on smoking and smoking cessation interventions.,Druckrey-Fiskaaen KT; Furulund E; Madebo T; Carlsen SL; Fadnes LT; Lid TG,"INTRODUCTION: Smoking-related diseases are major contributors to disability and shorter life expectancy among opioid-dependent patients. Smoking prevalence is considerably higher for opioid-dependent persons than among the general population, and only a minority quit smoking in treatment settings. Studies show that pharmacological smoking cessation interventions have modest success rates. This study aimed to investigate patients' receiving opioid agonist therapy perspectives on factors affecting behavior and decisions related to smoking cessation, and their experiences with smoking cessation. METHODS: This is a qualitative study using semi-structured individual interviews. The participants were asked, among others, to elaborate on the participants' thoughts about smoking, previous attempts to quit tobacco use, and what could prompt a smoking cessation attempt. We analyzed the transcripts with systematic text condensation. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research and the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines were followed. Opioid-dependent patients receiving opioid agonist therapy in outpatient clinics were invited to participate using a purposive sampling method. In total, fourteen individuals participated in this study. RESULTS: We identified six themes which were: (1) reflections on how smoking affected decisions, (2) smoking and its impact on physical and mental health, (3) the economy as a motivator to stop smoking, (4) emotions, desires, and habits related to smoking, (5) knowledge of smoking, smoking cessation, and quit attempts, and (6) social factors influencing the participants' choices and activities. The participants were well informed about the consequences of smoking and had some knowledge and experience in quitting. The participants' pulmonary health was an important motivational factor for change. Withdrawal symptoms, anxiety, and fear of using other substances discouraged several from attempting to quit smoking. In contrast, social support from partners and access to meaningful activities were considered important factors for success. Few reported being offered help from health professionals to make a smoking cessation attempt. DISCUSSION: Experiencing social support, being encouraged to quit smoking, and patients' concerns for their physical health were important reasons for wanting to quit smoking. Smoking cessation interventions based on patient preferences and on the behavior change wheel may enable a higher success rate among patients receiving opioid agonist therapy.",2023,,Front Psychiatry,14,,1185338,,10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1185338,37636821,#983,Druckrey-Fiskaaen 2023,,,0
Uptake of BRCA1/BRCA2 predictive genetic testing in an Irish population is low: a missed opportunity.,O'Reilly DE; Dooley L; Watson GA; Clarke R; Nolan A; Nolan C; Berkeley E; Farrell M; McDevitt T; Rogers M; Clabby C; Gallagher DJ,"INTRODUCTION: Predictive testing for BRCA1 or BRCA2 allows at-risk individuals to engage with appropriate screening and treatment services if a pathogenic mutation is identified. Previous studies have shown uptake of predictive testing to most commonly range between 20% and 40% (Table 2). This represents a missed cancer prevention opportunity. Possible explanations for this low uptake include lack of disclosure of at-risk status to relatives, lack of awareness of cancer genetics services, or patient preference. The goal of the current study was to investigate the uptake of BRCA1 or BRCA2 predictive testing in an Irish population. METHODS: We performed a multicentre, retrospective analysis of 63 pedigrees from two Irish tertiary referral hospitals over a five-year period (2012-2017). Family pedigrees were reviewed to identify at-risk family members eligible for predictive BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation testing as per international guidelines, and testing rates were determined. RESULTS: A total of 1048 eligible individuals were identified, 318 (30.4%) proceeded to BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline testing including [215 (37.5%) females and 99 males (21.5%)]. Women were significantly more likely to test than men (T = 3.7, p < .0002). Uptake of testing was significant higher amongst first-degree relatives 45% (150/323) compared to 20% (50/258) amongst second degree relatives, and 10 % (33/317) amongst more distant relatives (F = 25.32, p < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Uptake of BRCA1 OR BRCA2 mutation testing in Ireland is suboptimal, particularly amongst Irish males and distant relatives. Further research is needed to identify strategies which may improve uptake within current legal and ethical frameworks.",2023,Aug,Ir J Med Sci,192,4,1607-1611,,10.1007/s11845-022-03176-7,36260241,#1031,O'Reilly 2023,,,0

Early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy in patients with cancer who have low-risk neutropenic sepsis: the EASI-SWITCH RCT.,Coyle V; Forde C; Adams R; Agus A; Barnes R; Chau I; Clarke M; Doran A; Grayson M; McAuley D; McDowell C; Phair G; Plummer R; Storey D; Thomas A; Wilson R; McMullan R,"BACKGROUND: Neutropenic sepsis is a common complication of systemic anticancer treatment. There is variation in practice in timing of switch to oral antibiotics after commencement of empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy. OBJECTIVES: To establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of early switch to oral antibiotics in patients with neutropenic sepsis at low risk of infective complications. DESIGN: A randomised, multicentre, open-label, allocation concealed, non-inferiority trial to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of early oral switch in comparison to standard care. SETTING: Nineteen UK oncology centres. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 16 years and over receiving systemic anticancer therapy with fever (≥ 38°C), or symptoms and signs of sepsis, and neutropenia (≤ 1.0 × 10(9)/l) within 24 hours of randomisation, with a Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer score of ≥ 21 and receiving intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam or meropenem for < 24 hours were eligible. Patients with acute leukaemia or stem cell transplant were excluded. INTERVENTION: Early switch to oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice daily) and co-amoxiclav (625 mg three times daily) within 12-24 hours of starting intravenous antibiotics to complete 5 days treatment in total. Control was standard care, that is, continuation of intravenous antibiotics for at least 48 hours with ongoing treatment at physician discretion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment failure, a composite measure assessed at day 14 based on the following criteria: fever persistence or recurrence within 72 hours of starting intravenous antibiotics; escalation from protocolised antibiotics; critical care support or death. RESULTS: The study was closed early due to under-recruitment with 129 patients recruited; hence, a definitive conclusion regarding non-inferiority cannot be made. Sixty-five patients were randomised to the early switch arm and 64 to the standard care arm with subsequent intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses including 125 (intervention n = 61 and control n = 64) and 113 (intervention n = 53 and control n = 60) patients, respectively. In the intention-to-treat population the treatment failure rates were 14.1% in the control group and 24.6% in the intervention group, difference = 10.5% (95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.22). In the per-protocol population the treatment failure rates were 13.3% and 17.7% in control and intervention groups, respectively; difference = 3.7% (95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.148). Treatment failure predominantly consisted of persistence or recurrence of fever and/or physician-directed escalation from protocolised antibiotics with no critical care admissions or deaths. The median length of stay was shorter in the intervention group and adverse events reported were similar in both groups. Patients, particularly those with care-giving responsibilities, expressed a preference for early switch. However, differences in health-related quality of life and health resource use were small and not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Non-inferiority for early oral switch could not be proven due to trial under-recruitment. The findings suggest this may be an acceptable treatment strategy for some patients who can adhere to such a treatment regimen and would prefer a potentially reduced duration of hospitalisation while accepting increased risk of treatment failure resulting in re-admission. Further research should explore tools for patient stratification for low-risk de-escalation or ambulatory pathways including use of biomarkers and/or point-of-care rapid microbiological testing as an adjunct to clinical decision-making tools. This could include application to shorter-duration antimicrobial therapy in line with other antimicrobial stewardship studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered as ISRCTN84288963.

Outcomes of Laparoscopic Suture vs Mesh Rectopexy for Complete Rectal Prolapse.,Usman M; Khan IU; Hadi A,"Objective To compare outcomes of laparoscopic suture and laparoscopic mesh rectopexy for the treatment of complete rectal prolapse in adults. Materials and methods This study was conducted between December 2020 to December 2022, involving 75 patients (Group A: 34; Group B: 41). Inclusion criteria encompassed confirmed complete rectal prolapse. Preoperative measures included comprehensive assessments, mechanical bowel cleansing, prophylactic antibiotics, and rectal irrigation. Surgical techniques involved laparoscopic suture rectopexy for Group A and laparoscopic mesh rectopexy for Group B. Postoperative care and follow-up evaluations were conducted. Results Group A demonstrated advantages in terms of shorter operative times, quicker bowel activity resumption, and reduced hospital stays. Intraoperative bleeding was absent in Group A, while wound-related complications were higher in Group B. Recurrence rates were lower in Group A (2.9%) compared to Group B (9.8%). Both groups exhibited improvements in incontinence grades postoperatively. Constipation increased in both groups. Conclusion Both techniques are effective in treating complete rectal prolapse, each with its advantages and considerations. Group A showed potential benefits in terms of operative efficiency and fewer complications, albeit with a potential for increased recurrence. The study emphasizes the need for individualized patient care, considering factors such as operative characteristics, postoperative outcomes, and patient preferences.",2023,Dec,Cureus,15,12,e50758,,10.7759/cureus.50758,38239515,#557,Usman 2023,,,0
Patient Preferences in Short-Interval Staged Bilateral Rotator Cuff Repair.,Fliegel BE; Hall A; Patel A; Lee D; Cohen SB; Freedman K; Tjoumakaris F,"The decision to seek and undergo treatment for bilateral rotator cuff tears is often complex. The purpose of this study was to investigate patient preferences for undergoing short-interval staged bilateral rotator cuff repair; timing of surgeries; and order of surgeries. A retrospective analysis was performed for patients who underwent bilateral arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs within 12 months at a single institution. Postoperative patient-reported outcomes, satisfaction, and decision-making factors were collected via REDCap surveys. Ninety patients were included (63 men and 27 women; mean age, 58.1 years). The mean time between surgeries was 7.33 months. Forty-two percent of patients had left rotator cuff repair first. Patients reported a mean satisfaction score of 91.6 of 100 with the order of the surgeries and 87.3 of 100 with the timing of the surgeries. Mean postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons standardized assessment scores were 94.6 and 93.7 (left vs right shoulder first, respectively) for left shoulders and 94.2 and 93.9 (left vs right shoulder first, respectively) for right shoulders. Mean postoperative Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation scores were 86.5 and 83.9 (left vs right shoulder first, respectively) for left shoulders and 87.3 and 86.0 (left vs right shoulder first, respectively) for right shoulders. Decision-making factors noted as highly important included night pain, function, surgeon recommendation, and daily pain. Most patients who undergo short-interval staged bilateral rotator cuff repair are satisfied with the order and timing of their surgery. Decision-making factors such as night pain and functional limitation play a key role in the timing and order of bilateral rotator cuff repairs.

"Validation of the Cooper-Norcross Inventory of Preferences (C-NIP) in Chinese lay clients and mental health professionals: Factor structure, measurement invariance, and scale differences.",She Z; Xi J; Cooper M; Norcross JC; Di Malta G,"The Cooper-Norcross Inventory of Preferences (C-NIP) is one of the most widely used measures of psychotherapy preferences. However, its psychometric properties have not been examined in non-Western samples. Research on disparities between the preferences of mental health professionals and their clients is also limited. We evaluated the C-NIP's psychometric properties and measurement invariance in Chinese lay clients and mental health professionals and evaluated the latent mean differences between clients' and professionals' scores on the C-NIP's four scales (preference for therapist vs. client directiveness, emotional intensity vs. emotional reserve, past vs. present orientation, and warm support vs. focused challenge). This cross-sectional investigation involved 301 lay clients and 856 mental health professionals who completed the Chinese version of the C-NIP. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) were used to examine the factor structure of the C-NIP. ESEM provided stronger evidence than CFA for the four-factor model in both samples. The four scales had adequate internal consistency in both the lay clients (αs = .68-.89) and the mental health professionals (αs = .70-.80). Partial scalar invariance was established across these two populations. Chinese mental health professionals preferred less therapist directiveness, past orientation, and warm support-but more emotional intensity-than Chinese lay clients (ds = 0.25-0.90). Culture-specific cutoff values (norms) to identify strong therapy preferences were established. This study supports the application of the C-NIP to non-Western populations and suggests that discrepancies between the preferences of lay clients and mental health professionals are a cross-cultural phenomenon.

"Oropharynx pain, discomfort, and economic impact of transesophageal echocardiography for planned radio-frequency catheter ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation: A cross-sectional survey study.",Zeng R; Pu X; Chen S; Chen C; Chen Y; Chen W; Fu H,"BACKGROUND: To survey the unmet medical needs associated with atrium thrombus screening in Chinese patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for planned radio-frequency catheter ablation (RFCA). METHODS: This cross-sectional survey study interviewed 300 patients who underwent their first TEE for planned RFCA. The surveyed information included patients' anxiety, oropharynx pain and discomfort, time expense, and patient satisfaction related to TEE examination. Patient preference for a new atrium thrombus screening technology, hospital length of stay (LOS) of RFCA, and hospital costs of RFCA in these surveyed patients were collected as well. Descriptive statistical methods were used to summarize the collected survey information. RESULTS: Of the 300 interviewed patients, 36.3% reported anxiety before TEE examination, 58.6% reported oropharynx pain related to TEE, and 76.2% reported oropharynx discomforts, mainly including foreign body sensation (54.3%), dry heaves (33.8%), nausea (31.9%), and bleeding (22.9%). Even though 62.3% were satisfied with TEE, 84.3% preferred a new technology to replace TEE. Conducting outpatient TEE took more wait time (4.4 days vs. 0.1 days, p = 0.016) but led to significantly shorter hospital LOS (3.8 days vs. 6.4 days, p < 0.001) and significant lower hospital costs for RFCA (¥74,097 vs. ¥85,843, p < 0.001) than conducting inpatient TEE. CONCLUSIONS: Most AF patients experienced oropharynx pain and discomfort during or after TEE. Although more than half of AF patients were satisfied with TEE, most AF patients preferred a new technology to replace TEE for atrium thrombus screening. TEE was associated with economic impact on RFCA irrespective of TEE conducting settings.",2023,Oct,Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,48,,101266,,10.1016/j.ijcha.2023.101266,37719868,#815,Zeng 2023,,,0
Functional status and therapy for older adults with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in nursing homes: A population-based study.,Di M; Keeney T; Belanger E; Huntington SF; Olszewski AJ; Panagiotou OA,"OBJECTIVES: To characterize the prevalence of functional and cognitive impairments, and associations between impairments and treatment among older patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) receiving nursing home (NH) care. METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database to identify beneficiaries diagnosed with DLBCL 2011-2015 who received care in a NH within -120 ~ +30 days of diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare receipt of chemoimmunotherapy (including multi-agent, anthracycline-containing regimens), 30-day mortality, and hospitalization between NH and community-dwelling patients, estimating odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We also examined overall survival (OS). Among NH patients, we examined receipt of chemoimmunotherapy based on functional and cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Of the eligible 649 NH patients (median age: 82 years), 45% received chemoimmunotherapy; among the recipients, 47% received multi-agent, anthracycline-containing regimens. Compared with community-dwelling patients, those in a NH were less likely to receive chemoimmunotherapy (OR: 0.34, 95%CI: 0.29-0.41), had higher 30-day mortality (OR: 2.00, 95%CI: 1.43-2.78) and hospitalization (OR: 1.51, 95%CI: 1.18-1.93), and poorer OS (hazard ratio: 1.36, 95%CI: 1.11-1.65). NH patients with severe functional (61%) or any cognitive impairment (48%) were less likely to receive chemoimmunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: High rates of functional and cognitive impairment and low rates of chemoimmunotherapy were observed among NH residents diagnosed with DLBCL. Further research is needed to better understand the potential role of novel and alternative treatment strategies and patient preferences for treatment to optimize clinical care and outcomes in this high-risk population.",2023,Jul,J Am Geriatr Soc,71,7,2239-2249,,10.1111/jgs.18302,36882865,#1131,Di 2023,,,0
Patients' perspectives and preferences toward telemedicine versus in-person visits: a mixed-methods study on 1226 patients.,Moulaei K; Sheikhtaheri A; Fatehi F; Shanbehzadeh M; Bahaadinbeigy K,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the fact that telemedicine can eliminate geographical and time limitations and offer the possibility of diagnosing, treating, and preventing diseases by sharing reliable information, many individuals still prefer to visit medical centers for in-person consultations. The aim of this study was to determine the level of acceptance of telemedicine compared to in-person visits, identify the perceived advantages of telemedicine over in-person visits, and to explore the reasons why patients choose either of these two types of visits. METHODS: We developed a questionnaire using the rational method. The questionnaire consisted of multiple-choice questions and one open-ended question. A total of 2059 patients were invited to participate in the study. Chi-square tests and descriptive statistics were employed for data analysis. To analyze the data from the open-ended question, we conducted qualitative content analysis using MAXQDA 18. RESULTS: Out of the 1226 participants who completed the questionnaire, 865 (71%) preferred in-person visits, while 361 (29%) preferred telemedicine. Factors such as education level, specific health conditions, and prior experience with telemedicine influenced the preference for telemedicine. The participants provided a total of 183 different reasons for choosing either telemedicine (108 reasons) or in-person visits (75 reasons). Avoiding infectious diseases, saving cost, and eliminating and overcoming geographical distance barriers were three primary telemedicine benefits. The primary reasons for selecting an in-person visit were: more accurate diagnosis of the disease, more accurate and better examination of the patient by the physician, and more accurate and better treatment of the disease. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that despite the numerous benefits offered by telemedicine, the majority of patients still exhibit a preference for in-person visits. In order to promote broader acceptance of telemedicine, it becomes crucial for telemedicine services to address patient preferences and concerns effectively. Employing effective change management strategies can aid in overcoming resistance and facilitating the widespread adoption of telemedicine within the population.",2023,Nov,BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,23,1,261,,10.1186/s12911-023-02348-4,37968639,#683,Moulaei 2023,,,0
Treatment preferences among Japanese patients and physicians for epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.,Hata A; Fifer S; Hasegawa K; Ando E; Kasahara-Kiritani M; Takahashi M; Ordman R; Toh L; Inoue A,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence is limited on preferences of Japanese patients and physicians in treatment for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several oral or intravenous novel agents for EGFR exon 20 insertions are under development. The aim of our study was to investigate which attributes of novel treatments influenced selection of oral or intravenous agents among treated patients and treating physicians in Japan. METHODS: The study was designed by board-certified oncologists, patient representatives, and analytics specialists. Eligible participants completed an online survey with a discrete choice experiment presenting two treatment profiles described by attributes: mode of administration (oral or intravenous); frequency of administration; overall response rate (ORR); average progression-free survival (PFS); chance of experiencing severe side effects (SEs); mild-moderate gastrointestinal SEs; mild-moderate skin-related SEs; and patient out-of-pocket costs. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (all self-reported EGFR-mutant) and 74 physicians participated from December 2021 to August 2022. All attributes being equal, there was greater preference for oral administration. However, there was greater preference for intravenous over oral, when ORR and PFS improved by 10% and 1 month, and severe SEs reduced by 10%. Physicians exhibited greater preference for PFS compared to patients (p < 0.01). Ranked order of attribute importance was as follows: (1) PFS; (2) ORR; (3) severe SEs, expressed by patients and physicians alike. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed Japanese physician and patient preferences in treatment options for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Compared to the strong preference for a more efficacious drug, the preference of oral versus intravenous revealed a smaller impact.",2024,Jan,Cancer Med,13,1,,,10.1002/cam4.6777,38196301,#483,Hata 2024,,,1
Driving factors in treatment decision-making of patients seeking medical assistance for infertility: a systematic review.,von Estorff F; Mochtar MH; Lehmann V; van Wely M,"BACKGROUND: ART differs in effectiveness, side-effects, administration, and costs. To improve the decision-making process, we need to understand what factors patients consider to be most important. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: We conducted this systematic review to assess which aspects of ART treatment (effectiveness, safety, burden, costs, patient-centeredness, and genetic parenthood) are most important in the decision-making of patients with an unfulfilled wish to have a child. SEARCH METHODS: We searched studies indexed in Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL prior to November 2023. Discrete choice experiments (DCEs), surveys, interviews, and conjoint analyses (CAs) about ART were included. Studies were included if they described two or more of the following attributes: effectiveness, safety, burden, costs, patient-centeredness, and genetic parenthood.Participants were men and women with an unfulfilled wish to have a child. From each DCE/CA study, we extracted the beta-coefficients and calculated the relative importance of treatment attributes or, in case of survey studies, extracted results. We assessed the risk of bias using the rating developed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group. Attributes were classified into effectiveness, safety, burden, costs, patient-centeredness, genetic parenthood, and others. OUTCOMES: The search identified 938 studies of which 20 were included: 13 DCEs, three survey studies, three interview studies, and one conjoint analysis, with a total of 12 452 patients. Per study, 47-100% of the participants were women. Studies were assessed as having moderate to high risk of bias (critical: six studies, serious: four studies, moderate: nine studies, low: one study). The main limitation was the heterogeneity in the questionnaires and methodology utilized. Studies varied in the number and types of assessed attributes. Patients' treatment decision-making was mostly driven by effectiveness, followed by safety, burden, costs, and patient-centeredness. Effectiveness was rated as the first or second most important factor in 10 of the 12 DCE studies (83%) and the relative importance of effectiveness varied between 17% and 63%, with a median of 34% (moderate certainty of evidence). Of eight studies evaluating safety, five studies valued safety as the first or second most important factor (63%), and the relative importance ranged from 8% to 35% (median 23%) (moderate certainty of evidence). Cost was rated as first or second most important in five of 10 studies, and the importance relative to the other attributes varied between 5% and 47% (median 23%) (moderate certainty of evidence). Burden was rated as first or second by three of 10 studies (30%) and the relative importance varied between 1% and 43% (median 13%) (low certainty of evidence). Patient-centeredness was second most important in one of five studies (20%) and had a relative importance between 7% and 24% (median 14%) (low certainty of evidence). Results suggest that patients are prepared to trade-off some effectiveness for more safety, or less burden and patient-centeredness. When safety was evaluated, the safety of the child was considered more important than the mother's safety. Greater burden (cycle cancellations, number of injections, number of hospital visits, time) was more likely to be accepted by patients if they gained effectiveness, safety, or lower costs. Concerning patient-centeredness, information provision and physician attitude were considered most important, followed by involvement in decision-making, and treatment continuity by the same medical professional. Non-genetic parenthood did not have a clear impact on decision-making. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The findings of this review can be used in future preference studies and can help healthcare professionals in guiding patients' decision-making and enable a more patient-centered approach.",2024,Feb,Hum Reprod Update,,,,,10.1093/humupd/dmae001,38305635,#404,vonEstorff 2024,,,1

Estimating optimal individualized treatment rules with multistate processes.,Bakoyannis G,"Multistate process data are common in studies of chronic diseases such as cancer. These data are ideal for precision medicine purposes as they can be leveraged to improve more refined health outcomes, compared to standard survival outcomes, as well as incorporate patient preferences regarding quantity versus quality of life. However, there are currently no methods for the estimation of optimal individualized treatment rules with such data. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric outcome weighted learning approach for this problem in randomized clinical trial settings. The theoretical properties of the proposed methods, including Fisher consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimated expected outcome under the estimated optimal individualized treatment rule, are rigorously established. A consistent closed-form variance estimator is provided and methodology for the calculation of simultaneous confidence intervals is proposed. Simulation studies show that the proposed methodology and inference procedures work well even with small-sample sizes and high rates of right censoring. The methodology is illustrated using data from a randomized clinical trial on the treatment of metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck.",2023,Dec,Biometrics,79,4,2830-2842,,10.1111/biom.13864,37015010,#645,Bakoyannis 2023,,,0
Preferences of patients with diabetes mellitus for primary healthcare institutions: a discrete choice experiment in China.,Lv Y; Qin J; Feng X; Li S; Tang C; Wang H,"OBJECTIVES: To quantify the preference of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) for primary healthcare (PHC) institutions in China to redirect the patient flow and improve health outcomes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. Discrete choice experiment (DCE) surveys asked patients with DM to choose between hypothetical institutions that differed in the medical service capacity, out-of-pocket (OOP) medical costs per month, travel time, the attitude of medical staff and the availability of diabetes drugs. SETTING: Shandong province, China. PARTICIPANTS: The participants were 887 patients with DM from 36 urban communities and 36 rural villages in Shandong province. One participant did not provide any DCE answers and a further 57 patients failed the internal consistency test. 829 fully completed surveys were included in the final data analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A mixed logit model was used to calculate the willingness to pay and predict choice probabilities for PHC institution attributes. Preference heterogeneity was also investigated. RESULTS: All five attributes were associated with the preferences of patients with DM. The OOP medical costs and the medical service capacity were the most influential attributes. Improvements simultaneously in the attitude of medical staff, drug availability and travel time increased the likelihood of a patient's PHC institution choice. Preferences differed by region, annual household income and duration of diabetes.

Health involvement modulates physician preference in the brain during online health consultation.,Zhang Y; Wan Y; Rao H,"In traditional offline health-seeking behavior, patients consistently exhibit a preference for similar types of physicians due to limited access to physicians' information. Nevertheless, with the advent of online health consultation platforms offering comprehensive physicians' information for patients, raises the question: do patients continue to exhibit uniform preference for physicians? To address this issue, we first employed a behavioral experiment to discern patients' preferences for different types of physicians' information under different health involvement, and then conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment to furnish neural/physiological evidence. The results showed that health involvement modulates patients' preferences, when health involvement was low, patients had diverse preferences for physicians, that is, different types of physicians' information could individually impact patients' choice and could serve as substitutes for each other. When health involvement was high, patients' preference for physicians were uniform, highlighting that the collective influence of different types of physicians' information on patients' choice behavior. From the neural level, an explanation for the results was that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and ventral striatum (VS) brain regions, two key brain regions reflecting individual cognitive resource allocation, had different activation levels under different health involvement, indicating that patients allocated different cognitive resources.",2024,Jan,Sci Rep,14,1,1269,,10.1038/s41598-024-51519-4,38219006,#474,Zhang 2024,,,0
Understanding community-dwelling older adults' preferences for home- and community-based services: A conjoint analysis.,Chen S; Yang J; Ma B; Meng J; Chen Y; Ma T; Zhang X; Wang Y; Huang Y; Zhao Y; Lu Q,"BACKGROUND: Older adults' preference for home- and community-based service programs has been highlighted as an essential but usually ignored ingredient in current care models. Disentangling how preferences contribute to older adults' decision-making could facilitate finding optimal ways to deliver home- and community-based services in times of increasing scarcity. OBJECTIVE: To identify Chinese community-dwelling older adults' preference structure for home- and community-based services and thus to optimize service provision. METHODS: Conjoint analysis, a preference-based technique, was employed to study older adults' preferences. A stepwise qualitative approach was first adopted to identify the attributes and attribute levels of home- and community-based services. Scenarios were defined through an orthogonal fractional factorial design, and a cross-sectional survey was conducted through a face-to-face, anonymous questionnaire. Conjoint analysis was performed to determine preference weights representing the relative importance of the identified attributes, and cluster analysis was performed to identify clusters of participants with similar preference structures. All data analyses were performed using SAS v9.4 and SPSS 22.0. RESULTS: A total of 321 of 350 invited participants completed the questionnaire. Four attributes were identified and used to create the conjoint scenarios: care-giving attitude, price, technical care-giving skills, and the type of service provider. Care-giving attitude was the most valued attribute for older adults when making decisions (relative importance score = 48.28), followed by price (relative importance score = 21.618), technical care-giving skills (relative importance score = 19.518), and finally, the type of service provider (relative importance score = 10.585). Three preference phenotypes were identified by applying cluster analysis: ""price-oriented"", ""comprehensively balanced"", and ""attitude-oriented"". CONCLUSION: The present study underscored the importance of considering attributes valued by Chinese older adults in the design and delivery of home- and community-based services. The preference structure, including the utility score of the attribute levels, differs among older adults. The findings could inform future research and practice and suggest incorporating flexibility during the service delivery stage.",2024,Apr,Int J Nurs Stud,152,,104699,,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2024.104699,38308935,#188,Chen 2024,,,1
Analysis of patients' thoughts and background factors influencing attitudes toward Deprescribing: interviews to obtain hints for highly satisfying and valid prescriptions.,Arai S; Ishikawa T; Arai K; Suzuki T; Ishii I,"BACKGROUND: Prescribing with high levels of medical appropriateness and patient satisfaction improves adherence. However, its appropriateness does not always match patient preference. Deprescription is important for ensuring the safety of medication therapy, but is not straightforward. Although successful deprescribing requires knowledge of patients' thoughts on their prescriptions and factors that influence their acceptance of deprescribing, few comprehensive studies have been conducted on this topic. The aim of this study was to identify factors that influence patients' attitudes toward deprescribing and obtain hints on how to achieve higher patient satisfaction and prescribing adequacy. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to hospitalized patients and a logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine factors that influence their attitude toward deprescribing. Individual factors affecting patients' thoughts and wishes regarding prescribing were extracted and analysed in detail. RESULTS: The analysis included 106 patients, of whom 40 (37.7%) wished deprescribing. Logistic regression analysis showed that ""Age"", ""Wish to reduce the number and types of medications"", ""Satisfaction"", ""Concerns about side effects"", and ""Wish not to have certain medications changed"" were factors influencing attitudes toward deprescribing. The results suggested that the factors were influenced by patients' perceptions and individual patient backgrounds. There was a gap between willingness to reduce medication and to change their medications. Seventy-eight percent of all respondents indicated that they would like to reduce the number and type of pills they take if possible. However, only 44.6% of these patients indicated that they would actually like to change their medication. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the only one to comprehensively investigate prescription content, patient background, and patients' thoughts on factors influencing attitudes toward deprescribing. This study revealed five factors that can influence inclination toward deprescribing. In addition, the results suggest that patients want to be able to feel well with fewer medications if possible. This information may be useful in determining prescriptions that have high validity and patient satisfaction. Further research is needed on the gap between willingness to reduce medications and to change medications.",2023,Dec,J Pharm Health Care Sci,9,1,51,,10.1186/s40780-023-00325-7,38082333,#569,Arai 2023,,,0
Safety outcomes and patients' preferences for home-based intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in pompe disease and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) disorder: COVID-19 and beyond.,Toscano A; Musumeci O; Sacchini M; Ravaglia S; Siciliano G; Fiumara A; Verrecchia E; Maione M; Gentile J; Fischetto R; Crescimanno G; Taurisano R; Sechi A; Gasperini S; Cianci V; Maggi L; Parini R; Lupica A; Scarpa M,"BACKGROUND: The Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) demands precise information on benefit/risk profile of home-based enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of patients with Pompe disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). This passage is necessary to obtain the authorization for ERT home therapy, even after the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic period. This research intends to evaluate the safety, treatment satisfaction, and compliance of MPS I patients treated with laronidase (Aldurazyme®) and Pompe Disease patients treated with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme®) in a homecare setting. RESULTS: We report herein an early interim analysis of the HomERT (Home infusions of ERT) study, a multicenter, non-interventional, double-cohort study that retrospectively analyzed 38 patients from 14 sites in Italy: cohort A (Pompe disease - 32 patients) and cohort B (MPS I - 6 patients). Among the selected patients who started home therapy before enrollment, the average number of missed home-based infusions was 0.7 (1.3) in cohort A and 3.8 (6.4) in cohort B with no return to the hospital setting. Irrespective of the treatment location, 3 prior ADRs per cohort were reported. The majority of patients preferred home-based infusions (cohort A: 96.9%; cohort B: 100%): the main reason was attributed to treatment convenience (cohort A: 81.3%; cohort B: 83.3%). Despite the underlying conditions, most patients self-evaluated their health as ""good"" (cohort A: 50%; cohort B: 83.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of favorable safety profile, improved treatment compliance and personal satisfaction validates the use of ERT with laronidase and alglucosidase alfa as a strong candidate for home therapy.",2023,Oct,Orphanet J Rare Dis,18,1,338,,10.1186/s13023-023-02919-8,37891668,#761,Toscano 2023,,,0
"Acceptability of patient-centered, multi-disciplinary medication therapy management recommendations: results from the INCREASE randomized study.",Smith NI; Martinez AI; Huffmyer M; Eckmann L; George R; Abner EL; Jicha GA; Moga DC,"BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy and inappropriate medications may be a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Medication therapy management (MTM) interventions may mitigate medication-induced cognitive dysfunction and delay onset of symptomatic impairment. The objective of the current study is to describe an MTM protocol for a patient-centered team intervention (pharmacist and non-pharmacist clinician) in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) directed at delaying the symptomatic onset of ADRD. METHODS: Community dwelling adults 65 + years, non-demented, using ≥ 1 potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) were enrolled in an RCT to evaluate the effect of an MTM intervention on improving medication appropriateness and cognition (NCT02849639). The MTM intervention involved a three-step process: (1) pharmacist identified potential medication-related problems (MRPs) and made initial recommendations for prescribed and over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements; (2) study team reviewed all initial recommendations together with the participants, allowing for revisions prior to the finalized recommendations; (3) participant responses to final recommendations were recorded. Here, we describe initial recommendations, changes during team engagement, and participant responses to final recommendations. RESULTS: Among the 90 participants, a mean 6.7 ± 3.6 MRPs per participant were reported. Of the 259 initial MTM recommendations made for the treatment group participants (N = 46), 40% percent underwent revisions in the second step. Participants reported willingness to adopt 46% of final recommendations and expressed need for additional primary care input in response to 38% of final recommendations. Willingness to adopt final recommendations was highest when therapeutic switches were offered and/or with anticholinergic medications. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of modifications to MTM recommendations demonstrated that pharmacists' initial MTM recommendations often changed following the participation in the multidisciplinary decision-making process that incorporated patient preferences. The team was encouraged to see a correlation between engaging patients and a positive overall response towards participant acceptance of final MTM recommendations.

The role of topical therapies along the psoriasis patient journey: An overview from the Symposium 'Tailoring topical psoriasis treatments to patients' needs and expectations' of the 30(th) EADV Congress 2021.,Pinter A; van de Kerkhof P,"This article summarizes a presentation titled 'The role of topical therapies along the psoriasis patient journey' held at the Satellite Symposium of the 30(th) European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress. During this session, the role of topical treatments in the management of psoriasis was presented, with a particular focus on the current unmet needs and data gaps. Psoriasis plays a significant role in a patient's daily life, impacting them not only physically but also psychologically and socially. The disease burden increases with duration and severity. Topical therapies are the keystone of the management of psoriasis. About 70%-80% of patients present a mild-to-moderate form of psoriasis that can be successfully treated with topical agents. According to a German recommendation, patients with mild psoriasis should initiate a topical therapy in combination with skin care products. In the real-life setting, the calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (CAL/BDP) fixed combination was the most prescribed topical treatment for beyond-mild patients in Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. Healthcare professionals also often or very often prescribed topicals as an alternative to non-biologic systemics in certain situations, such as patient preference (51%), contraindication (50%) and to limit side effects (26%). Adjunctive topical therapy to patients using systemic therapy is used to optimize treatment outcomes and improving the quality of life for patients. Topical treatments can be also effective in severe forms of psoriasis. However, there are still some gaps and unmet needs on topical therapy. Ineffectiveness, patient dissatisfaction and adherence are the largest barriers to treatment success. Main strengths of topical treatments include the availability of various topical ingredients and galenics, the adaptability to different anatomical areas and the possible combination with phototherapy and systemics. Moreover, patients in specific situations can benefit from switching to topical treatments (e.g. pregnancy or surgery).",2023,Jan,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,37 Suppl 1,,3-8,,10.1111/jdv.18761,36546464,#1629,Pinter 2023,,,0
The Longest Known Survival of a Patient With Bioprosthetic Aortic Valve Replacement: A 42-Year Follow-Up.,Ahmed KA; Ahmed J; Samant A; Arub Y; Mohsin I; Ahmed MH,"Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is a frequently performed procedure for treating aortic valvulopathy. AVR involves replacing the damaged aortic valve with either a mechanical or a bioprosthetic valve. While many factors are involved when selecting between the two options, age and patient preference are the deciding factors at this point. Mechanical valves demonstrate long-standing durability that overlaps with the accompanied bleeding risk due to lifetime anticoagulant therapy, making them a more favorable choice for younger patients. Bioprosthetic valves are preferred for older patients as they show a reduced risk of thrombogenicity. However, bioprosthetic valves have a higher incidence of structural valve degeneration (SVD) than mechanical valves. Our case report focuses on a 76-year-old patient who had undergone an AVR with a bioprosthetic valve at the age of 33, which has still not demonstrated any valve deterioration. As the longest known case of bioprosthetic durability, this patient provides useful data for designing bioprosthetic valves more resistant to structural degeneration and thereby better suited to younger patients or those at higher risk of bleeding.",2023,Aug,Cureus,15,8,e44069,,10.7759/cureus.44069,37638273,#966,Ahmed 2023,,,0
Spinal Versus General Anesthesia for Outpatient Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty in the Ambulatory Surgery Center: A Matched-Cohort Study.,Calkins TE; Johnson EP; Eason RR; Mihalko WM; Ford MC,"BACKGROUND: Spinal anesthesia is the predominant regimen in outpatient total joint arthroplasty (TJA), but induction often is unsuccessful, unobtainable, or against patient preference. We compared outcomes of same-day discharge (SDD) TJA with spinal versus general anesthesia in a free-standing ambulatory surgery center (ASC). METHODS: We took 105 general anesthesia TJA and one-to-one nearest-neighbor matched them to 105 spinal anesthesia TJA over 7 years at 1 ASC. The rate of successful SDD, minutes to discharge, postoperative pain and nausea, and 90-day complications were compared. Postanesthesia care unit outcomes were additionally stratified by spinal anesthetic (mepivacaine versus bupivacaine). RESULTS: All spinal anesthetic patients underwent SDD compared with 103 (98%) general anesthetic patients (P = .498). Mepivacaine spinal anesthesia patients spent the fewest minutes in postanesthesia care unit prior to discharge from the facility (206), followed by general anesthesia (227), and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia (291; P < .001). General anesthesia patients had the highest levels of pain at 1 hour (5.2 versus 1.5 versus 1.5) and 2 hours (3.2 versus 2.0 versus 1.3) postoperatively, and rates of nausea (48 versus 22 versus 28%) compared with mepivacaine and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia, respectively. The 90-day complications (6 versus 7), admissions (1 versus 3), and reoperations (5 versus 2) were similar among spinal and general anesthesia, respectively (P ≥ .445). CONCLUSIONS: Both spinal and general anesthesia led to reliable SDD with similar 90-day complication rates. General anesthesia facilitated faster discharge from the ASC compared with bupivacaine spinal anesthesia but led to higher levels of pain and incidence of nausea postoperatively.

Associations between Present-on-Admission Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders and Short-Term Outcomes in Patients with Pneumonia.,Sheehan MM; Zilberberg MD; Lindenauer PK; Higgins TL; Imrey PB; Guo N; Deshpande A; Haessler SD; Rothberg MB,"OBJECTIVES: Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders are used to express patient preferences for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This study examined whether early DNR orders are associated with differences in treatments and outcomes among patients hospitalized with pneumonia. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 768,015 adult patients hospitalized with pneumonia from 2010 to 2015 in 646 US hospitals. The exposure was DNR orders present on admission. Secondary analyses stratified patients by predicted in-hospital mortality. Main outcomes included in-hospital mortality, length of stay, cost, intensive care admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, noninvasive ventilation, vasopressors, and dialysis initiation. RESULTS: Of 768,015 patients, 94,155 (12.3%) had an early DNR order. Compared with those without, patients with DNR orders were older (mean age 80.1 ± 10.6 years vs 67.8 ± 16.4 years), with higher comorbidity burden, intensive care use (31.6% vs 30.6%), and in-hospital mortality (28.2% vs 8.5%). After adjustment via propensity score weighting, these patients had higher mortality (odds ratio [OR] 2.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.33-2.45) and lower use of intensive therapies such as vasopressors (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.81-0.85) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.66-0.70). Although there was little relationship between predicted mortality and DNR orders, among those with highest predicted mortality, DNR orders were associated with lower intensive care use compared with those without (66.7% vs 80.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with early DNR orders have higher in-hospital mortality rates than those without, but often receive intensive care. These orders have the most impact on the care of patients with the highest mortality risk.",2024,Mar,South Med J,117,3,165-171,,10.14423/SMJ.0000000000001663,38428939,#280,Sheehan 2024,,,0
Preferences of pregnant individuals to undergo labor after one cesarean in southern China.,Rao J; Fan D; Lu D; Liu Y; Guo X; Liu Z,"BACKGROUND: Labor after cesarean (LAC) remains an optional delivery method among healthy pregnant individuals. Exploring women's attitudes, preferences, reasons for previous cesarean delivery, and the incentives underlying pregnant individuals' preferences could help us understand their choice of delivery mode. In this study we evaluated the preferences and attitudes of eligible pregnant women regarding participation in a LAC in Foshan, China. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 438 pregnant individuals with one prior cesarean delivery (CD) who attended their antenatal examination at a tertiary hospital in southern China, between November 1, 2018, and October 31, 2019. Information on demographic characteristics, obstetric data, preferences for LAC, and incentives for LAC were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 85.4% (374/438) of women preferred LAC if they did not have contraindications before delivery, whereas 12.3% (54/438) refused and 2.3% (10/438) were unsure. Participants reported that the most important factors affecting their willingness to undergo LAC were safety indicators (i.e., ""ability of hospitals to perform emergency cesarean delivery"" [score of 9.28 ± 1.86]), followed by accessibility indicators (i.e., ""priority bed arrangements"" [score of 9.17 ± 1.84]). Logistic regression analysis indicated that neonatal wellbeing with the prior CD was an independent influencing factor (OR = 2.235 [95%CI: 1.115-4.845], p = 0.024) affecting willingness to access LAC in the subsequent pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high preference for LAC among pregnant individuals without contraindications before delivery in southern China. Healthcare providers need to ensure access to LAC and increase pregnant individuals' LAC willingness through high-quality shared decsision-making in alignment with patient preferences.",2023,Dec,Birth,50,4,988-995,,10.1111/birt.12743,37496210,#633,Rao 2023,,,0
Variation in seizure risk increases from antiseizure medication withdrawal among patients with well-controlled epilepsy: A pooled analysis.,Terman SW; Slinger G; Koek A; Skvarce J; Springer MV; Ziobro JM; Burke JF; Otte WM; Thijs RD; Lossius MI; Marson AG; Bonnett LJ; Braun KPJ,"OBJECTIVE: Guidelines suggest considering antiseizure medication (ASM) discontinuation in seizure-free patients with epilepsy. Past work has poorly explored how discontinuation effects vary between patients. We evaluated (1) what factors modify the influence of discontinuation on seizure risk; and (2) the range of seizure risk increase due to discontinuation across low- versus high-risk patients. METHODS: We pooled three datasets including seizure-free patients who did and did not discontinue ASMs. We conducted time-to-first-seizure analyses. First, we evaluated what individual patient factors modified the relative effect of ASM discontinuation on seizure risk via interaction terms. Then, we assessed the distribution of 2-year risk increase as predicted by our adjusted logistic regressions. RESULTS: We included 1626 patients, of whom 678 (42%) planned to discontinue all ASMs. The mean predicted 2-year seizure risk was 43% [95% confidence interval (CI) 39%-46%] for discontinuation versus 21% (95% CI 19%-24%) for continuation. The mean 2-year absolute seizure risk increase was 21% (95% CI 18%-26%). No individual interaction term was significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. The median [interquartile range (IQR)] risk increase across patients was 19% (IQR 14%-24%; range 7%-37%). Results were unchanged when restricting analyses to only the two RCTs. SIGNIFICANCE: No single patient factor significantly modified the influence of discontinuation on seizure risk, although we captured how absolute risk increases change for patients that are at low versus high risk. Patients should likely continue ASMs if even a 7% 2-year increase in the chance of any more seizures would be too much and should likely discontinue ASMs if even a 37% risk increase would be too little. In between these extremes, individualized risk calculation and a careful understanding of patient preferences are critical. Future work will further develop a two-armed individualized seizure risk calculator and contextualize seizure risk thresholds below which to consider discontinuation. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Understanding how much antiseizure medications (ASMs) decrease seizure risk is an important part of determining which patients with epilepsy should be treated, especially for patients who have not had a seizure in a while. We found that there was a wide range in the amount that ASM discontinuation increases seizure risk-between 7% and 37%. We found that no single patient factor modified that amount. Understanding what a patient's seizure risk might be if they discontinued versus continued ASM treatment is critical to making informed decisions about whether the benefit of treatment outweighs the downsides.",2024,Feb,Epilepsia Open,9,1,333-344,,10.1002/epi4.12880,38071463,#418,Terman 2024,,,0
Multidisciplinary decision-making and course of treatment in older patients with colorectal cancer: Effect of geriatrician input.,Smits MJI; Lebens IJ; Vondeling AM; van Tuyl SAC; Schiphorst AHW; van Huis LH; Hamaker ME,"INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the effect of the inclusion of a geriatrician in the multidisciplinary cancer team (MDT) on decision-making for chemotherapy with curative intent in older patients with colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We audited all patients aged 70 years and older with colorectal cancer discussed at MDT meetings between January 2010 and July 2018; selection was limited to those patients for whom guidelines recommended chemotherapy with curative intent as part of the primary treatment. We assessed how treatment decisions came about, and what the course of treatment was in the period before (2010-2013) and after (2014-2018) the geriatrician joined the MDT meetings. RESULTS: There were 157 patients included: 80 patients from 2010 to 2013 and 77 patients from 2014 to 2018. Age was mentioned significantly less often as the reason to withhold chemotherapy in the 2014-2018 cohort (10% vs 27% in 2010-2013, p = 0.04). Instead, patient preferences, physical condition, and comorbidities were the main reasons stated for withholding chemotherapy. Although a similar proportion of patients started chemotherapy in both cohorts, patients treated in 2014-2018 required many fewer treatment adaptations and were thus more likely to complete their treatments as planned. DISCUSSION: Over time and by incorporating a geriatrician's input, the multidisciplinary selection of older patients with colorectal cancer for chemotherapy with curative intent has improved. By basing decisions on an assessment of the patient's ability to tolerate treatment rather than using a more general parameter such as age, both overtreatment of not-so-fit patients and undertreatment of fit-but-old patients can be prevented.",2023,Mar,J Geriatr Oncol,14,2,101448,,10.1016/j.jgo.2023.101448,36797106,#1444,SmitsMJI 2023,,,0
Preferences of people living with HIV for injectable and oral antiretroviral treatment in the Netherlands: a discrete choice experiment.,Kremer IEH; Beaudart C; Simons J; Plieger H; Schroeder M; Hiligsmann M,"ABSTRACTInjectable antiretroviral treatment (ART) represents a new effective and potentially more convenient alternative to oral ART for people living with HIV (PLWH). This study assessed preferences of PLWH for long-acting injectable compared with oral ART in the Netherlands. A labelled discrete choice experiment presented 12 choice sets of long-acting injectable and oral ART. PLWH were asked to select their preferred ART, described by six attributes: location of administration, dosing frequency, risk of short-term side effects, drug-drug interaction, forgivability, and food and mealtime restrictions. Random parameters logit and latent class models were used to estimate preferences of PLWH. 98.6% of 76 respondents were experienced oral ART users that had taken ART for a median of 12 years (Q1-Q3: 7.0-20.0). 30 (39.5%) respondents chose long-acting injectable ART in all choice tasks and 22 (28.9%) always chose oral ART. The random parameter model showed that, on average, respondents significantly favoured long-acting injectable ART over oral ART, preferred administration of the long-acting injectable ART at home, and a less frequent regimen. The latent class model confirmed one class strongly preferring long-acting injectable ART and one class slightly preferring oral ART. This study highlights the value for both long-acting injectable and oral ART.",2024,Apr,AIDS Care,36,4,536-545,,10.1080/09540121.2023.2240067,37526109,#200,KremerIEH 2024,,,1
Patient Preferences in Metastatic Breast Cancer Care: A Scoping Review.,Bland KA; Mustafa R; McTaggart-Cowan H,"People with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) have diverse medical, physical, and psychosocial needs that require multidimensional care. Understanding patient preferences is crucial to tailor treatments, services, and foster patient-centered care. A scoping review was performed to summarize the current evidence on the preferences of people with MBC regarding their care to identify knowledge gaps and key areas for future research. The Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycInfo databases were searched. Twenty studies enrolling 3354 patients met the study eligibility criteria. Thirteen quantitative studies, four mixed methods studies, and three qualitative studies were included. Seven studies captured healthcare provider perspectives; thirteen studies evaluated patient preferences relating specifically to cancer treatments; three studies evaluated preferences relating to supportive care; and four studies evaluated communication and decision-making preferences. The current literature evaluating MBC patient preferences is heterogeneous with a focus on cancer treatments. Future research should explore patient preferences relating to multidisciplinary, multi-modal care that aims to improve quality of life.

Active surveillance versus treatment in low-risk DCIS: Women's preferences in the LORD-trial.,Schmitz RSJM; Engelhardt EG; Gerritsma MA; Sondermeijer CMT; Verschuur E; Houtzager J; Griffioen R; Retèl V; Bijker N; Mann RM; van Duijnhoven F; Wesseling J; Bleiker EMA,"BACKGROUND: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) can progress to invasive breast cancer (IBC), but most DCIS lesions remain indolent. However, guidelines recommend surgery, often supplemented by radiotherapy. This implies overtreatment of indolent DCIS. The non-randomised patient preference LORD-trial tests whether active surveillance (AS) for low-risk DCIS is safe, by giving women with low-risk DCIS a choice between AS and conventional treatment (CT). Here, we aim to describe how participants are distributed among both trial arms, identify their motives for their preference, and assess factors associated with their choice. METHODS: Data were extracted from baseline questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the distribution and characteristics of participants; thematic analyses to extract self-reported reasons for the choice of trial arm, and multivariable logistic regression analyses to investigate associations between patient characteristics and chosen trial arm. RESULTS: Of 377 women included, 76% chose AS and 24% CT. Most frequently cited reasons for AS were ""treatment is not (yet) necessary"" (59%) and trust in the AS-plan (39%). Reasons for CT were cancer worry (51%) and perceived certainty (29%). Women opting for AS more often had lower educational levels (OR 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.93) and more often reported experiencing shared decision making (OR 2.71; 95% CI, 1.37-5.37) than women choosing CT. CONCLUSION: The LORD-trial is the first to offer women with low-risk DCIS a choice between CT and AS. Most women opted for AS and reported high levels of trust in the safety of AS. Their preferences highlight the necessity to establish the safety of AS for low-risk DCIS.",2023,Oct,Eur J Cancer,192,,113276,,10.1016/j.ejca.2023.113276,37657228,#818,SchmitzRSJM 2023,,,0

Bariatric Surgery for Adults With Class I Obesity and Difficult-to-Manage Type 2 Diabetes: A Health Technology Assessment.,,"BACKGROUND: Many individuals with type 2 diabetes are classified as either overweight or obese. A patient may be described as having difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes if their HbA1c levels remain above recommended target levels, despite efforts to treat it with lifestyle changes and pharmacotherapy. Bariatric surgery refers to procedures that modify the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with class II or III obesity, bariatric surgery has resulted in substantial weight loss, improved quality of life, reduced mortality risk, and resolution of type 2 diabetes. There is some evidence suggesting these outcomes may also be possible for patients with class I obesity as well. We conducted a health technology assessment of bariatric surgery for adults with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes, which included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding bariatric surgery, and patient preferences and values. METHODS: We performed a systematic clinical literature review. We assessed the risk of bias of each included study, using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials, the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for cohort studies, and the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool for systematic reviews; we assessed the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature review and conducted a cost-utility analysis of bariatric surgery in comparison with nonsurgical usual care over a lifetime horizon from a public payer perspective. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding bariatric surgery for adults with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes in Ontario. To contextualize the potential value of bariatric surgery, we spoke with people with obesity and type 2 diabetes who had undergone or were considering this procedure. RESULTS: We included 14 studies in the clinical evidence review. There were large increases in diabetes remission rates (GRADE: Low to Very low) and large reductions in body mass index (GRADE: Low to Very low) with bariatric surgery than with medical management. Bariatric surgery may also reduce the use of medications for type 2 diabetes (GRADE: Low) and may improve quality of life for people with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes compared with medical management. (GRADE: Low)Our economic evidence review included 5 cost-effectiveness studies; none were conducted in a Canadian setting, and 4 were considered partially applicable to our research question. Most studies found bariatric surgery to be cost-effective compared to standard care for patients with class I obesity and type 2 diabetes; however, the applicability of these results to the Ontario context is uncertain due to potential differences in clinical practice, resource utilization, and unit costs.Our primary economic evaluation found that over a lifetime horizon, bariatric surgery was more costly (incremental cost: $8,151 per person) but also more effective than current usual care (led to a 0.339 quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gain per person). The cost increase was driven by costs associated with surgery (before, after, and during surgery), and the QALY gain was due to life-years gained. Results were sensitive to the bariatric surgery cost and assumptions regarding its long-term benefits with respect to weight loss and diabetes remission.Publicly funding 50 bariatric surgeries in year 1, and gradually increasing to 250 surgeries in year 5, for people with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes would lead to budget increases of $0.55 million in year 1 to $2.45 million in year 5, for a total of $7.63 million over 5 years.The people with obesity and type 2 diabetes with whom we spoke reported that bariatric surgery was generally seen as a positive treatment option, and those who had undergone the procedure reported positively on its value as a treatment to manage their weight and diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: For adults with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery may be more clinically effective and cost-effective than medical management. Compared with medical management in people with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery may result in large increases in diabetes remission rates, large reductions in BMI, and reduced medication use for type 2 diabetes, improved quality of life. Over a lifetime horizon, bariatric surgery led to a cost increase and QALY gain. Bariatric surgery can result in postsurgical complications that are not faced by those receiving medical management. The cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery depends on its long-term impacts on obesity-related and diabetes-related complications, which could be uncertain.Our budget impact analysis suggests that publicly funding bariatric surgery in Ontario for people with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes would lead to a budget increase of $7.63 million over 5 years.For people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery was seen as a potential positive treatment option to manage their weight and diabetes.",2023,,Ont Health Technol Assess Ser,23,8,1-151,,,38130940,#583,,,,0

Learning From Clinical Supervisor Practice Variability: Exploring Medical Resident and Fellow Experiences and Interpretations.,Mithoowani S; Khattak S; Lieberman S; Tseng EK; Zeller MP; van Merriënboer J,"PURPOSE: Clinical practice variability is characterized by 2 or more clinicians making different treatment decisions despite encountering a similar case. This study explores how medical residents and fellows experience and interpret intersupervisor clinical practice variability and how these variations influence learning. METHOD: Seventeen senior residents or fellows in internal medicine, hematology, or thrombosis medicine (postgraduate year 3 or above) participated in semistructured interviews after a clinical rotation in thrombosis medicine from December 2019 to March 2021. Data collection and analysis occurred iteratively and concurrently in a manner consistent with constructivist grounded theory. Variation theory was used to guide the development of some interview questions. A central tenet of this theory is that learning occurs by experiencing 3 sequential patterns of variation: contrast, generalization, and fusion. Participants were recruited purposively with respect to specialty until theoretical sufficiency was reached. RESULTS: Clinical practice variability was experienced by all participants. Residents and fellows attributed practice variability to intrinsic differences among supervisors; interinstitutional differences; selection and interpretation of evidence; patient preferences, priorities, and fears; and their own participation in the decision-making process. Clinical practice variability helped residents and fellows discern key features of cases that influenced decision-making (contrast), group similar cases so that the appropriate evidence could be applied (generalization), and develop attitudes consistent with providing individualized patient care (fusion). Observing practice variability was more helpful for fifth- and sixth-year residents and less helpful for third- and fourth-year residents. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practice variability helped residents and fellows discern critical aspects, group similar patients, and practice individualized medicine. Future research should characterize how clinical practice variability influences learning across the spectrum of training, how supervisors could encourage learning from practice variability, and how curricula could be modified to allow learners greater opportunity to reflect on and consolidate the practice differences they observe.",2024,Mar,Acad Med,99,3,310-316,,10.1097/ACM.0000000000005573,38039985,#308,Mithoowani 2024,,,0
"Patients' and Clinicians' Experiences with In-person, Video, and Phone Modalities for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment: A Qualitative Study.",Wyte-Lake T; Cohen DJ; Williams S; Casey D; Chan M; Frank B; Levander XA; Stein D; White KK; Bailey SR,"BACKGROUND: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic condition that requires regular visits and care continuity. Telehealth implementation has created multiple visit modalities for OUD care. There is limited knowledge of patients' and clinicians' perceptions and experiences related to multi-modality care and when different modalities might be best employed. OBJECTIVE: To identify patients' and clinicians' experiences with multiple visit modalities for OUD treatment in primary care. DESIGN: Comparative case study, using video- and telephone-based semi-structured interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Patients being treated for OUD (n = 19) and clinicians who provided OUD care (n = 15) from two primary care clinics within the same healthcare system. APPROACH: Using an inductive approach, interviews were analyzed to identify patients' and clinicians' experiences with receiving/delivering OUD care via different visit modalities. Clinicians' and patients' experiences were compared using a group analytical process. KEY RESULTS: Patients and clinicians valued having multiple modalities available for care, with flexibility identified as a key benefit. Patients highlighted the decreased burden of travel and less social anxiety with telehealth visits. Similarly, clinicians reported that telehealth decreased medical intrusion into the lives of patients stable in recovery. Patients and clinicians saw the value of in-person visits when establishing care and for patients needing additional support. In-person visits allowed the ability to conduct urine drug testing, and to foster relationships and trust building, which were more difficult, but not impossible via a telehealth visit. Patients preferred telephone over video visits, as these were more private and more convenient. Clinicians identified benefits of video, including being able to both hear and see the patient, but often deferred to patient preference. CONCLUSIONS: Considerations for utilization of visit modalities for OUD care were identified based on patients' needs and preferences, which often changed over the course of treatment. Continued research is needed determine how visit modalities impact patient outcomes.",2024,Jan,J Gen Intern Med,,,,,10.1007/s11606-023-08586-6,38228990,#470,Wyte-Lake 2024,,,0
Chaplain reported plans for end-of-life care conversations: Role clarity for the spiritual care specialists.,Russell J; Quaack KR; Nunez J,"The present study examined chaplain reported plans for patient conversations regarding end-of-life (EOL) care through the lens of multiple goals. Chaplains (n = 69) were asked to curate a plan for engaging with a patient about EOL treatment options, including how they would engage in the conversation and what they would plan to discuss. Findings indicated that plans primarily consisted of relational and identity goals, with a majority navigating multiple goal orientations. Content overwhelmingly involved developing rapport with patients, eliciting patient preferences for care, and serving as a patient liaison. The current study addresses the paucity of research around the role a chaplain plays on the interdisciplinary team and their respective approach to EOL conversations. Examination of curated plans affords insight to what content is prioritized and which conversational goals are present. Integration of multiple goals offers preliminary evidence for conversational quality. Awareness of goal approach and content prioritized affords clarity on how chaplains can be called upon to support members of the interdisciplinary care team.",2023,,J Health Care Chaplain,29,4,337-352,,10.1080/08854726.2022.2087965,35757912,#1675,Russell 2023,,,0
Heterogeneous Preferences for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Germany: Results of a Discrete Choice Experiment.,Brinkmann M; Diedrich L; Hemmerling M; Krauth C; Robra BP; Stahmeyer JT; Dreier M,"OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening tests differ in benefits, harms, and processes, making individual informed decisions preference based. The objective was to analyze the preferences of insurees in Germany for characteristics of CRC screening modalities. METHODS: A generic discrete choice experiment with 2-alternative choice sets and 6 attributes (CRC mortality, CRC incidence, complications, preparation, need for transportation, and follow-up; 3 levels each) depicting characteristics of fecal testing, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy was generated. Participants completed 8 choice tasks. Internal validity was tested using a within-set dominated pair. Between June and October 2020, written questionnaires were sent to a stratified random sample (n = 5000) of 50-, 55-, and 60-year-old insurees of the AOK (Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse) Lower Saxony, who had previously received an invitation to participate in the organized screening program including evidence-based information. Preferences were analyzed using conditional logit, mixed logit, and latent-class model. RESULTS: From 1282 questionnaires received (26% [1282 of 4945]), 1142 were included in the analysis. Approximately 42% of the respondents chose the dominated alternative in the internal validity test. Three heterogeneous preference classes were identified. Most important attributes were preparation (class 1; n = 505, 44%), CRC mortality (class 2; n = 347, 30%), and CRC incidence (class 3; n = 290, 25%). Contrary to a priori expectations, a higher effort was preferred for bowel cleansing (class 1) and accompaniment home (classes 1 and 2). CONCLUSION: Internal validity issues of choice data need further research and warrant attention in future discrete choice experiment surveys. The observed preference heterogeneity suggests different informational needs, although the underlying reasons remained unclear.",2023,Jan,Value Health,26,1,104-114,,10.1016/j.jval.2022.07.012,36031478,#1662,Brinkmann 2023,,,1
Evidence-based use of antihistamines for treatment of allergic conditions.,Linton S; Hossenbaccus L; Ellis AK,"Available since the 1940s, H(1) antihistamines are mainstay treatments for allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis and urticaria. They function as inverse agonists that bind to the H(1) receptor to inhibit histamine-induced inflammation. The older, first-generation drugs are no longer recommended for patient use because of their well-documented negative adverse effect profile. Evidence has been accumulating to support a newer generation of H(1) antihistamines in oral and intranasal formulations, including in combination with intranasal corticosteroids. The literature is replete with large meta-analyses and systematic reviews establishing the safety and efficacy of second-generation H(1) antihistamines in adult and pediatric allergic rhinitis populations, including combination nasal spray agents (eg, MP29-02 or MP-AzeFlu). Although intraclass differences do exist, patient preference, access, and costs should be the priority. Robust data on the regular, not as needed use of H(1) antihistamines for urticaria have been published, including in the management of children and pregnant or lactating women. In addition, H(1) antihistamines can be used in other related allergic conditions, such as the secondary symptoms of anaphylaxis, to provide patients with greater comfort, including in allergic asthma, depending on the individual.",2023,Oct,Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol,131,4,412-420,,10.1016/j.anai.2023.07.019,37517656,#821,Linton 2023,,,0
A qualitative study of teleconsultation practices among French oncologists in a post-COVID-19 period.,Lantheaume S; Doublet L; Mory JE; Durand T; Lebosse W; Heudel PE,"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted healthcare professionals to adapt and implement new tools to ensure continuity of patient care. Teleconsultation became the only option for some practitioners who had never used it previously and boosted its use for others who already used it. Several studies have reviewed the use of teleconsultation in oncology during the epidemic, but few have addressed its continued use and how practitioners view it in a post-epidemic period. The aim of this survey was to conduct a qualitative exploration of how oncologists use teleconsultation in their daily practice in a post-COVID 19 period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this qualitative study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with oncologists in France who utilized teleconsultation in the field of oncology during the COVID-19 period. The interview guide included questions on the interests and limitations of using teleconsultation in oncology, on reluctance to use it among oncologists, and invited participants to formulate proposals for more optimal use. RESULTS: Fourteen oncologists participated in the survey. Currently, 12% of the consultations of the surveyed practitioners are conducted via teleconsultation. Seven themes were identified in the analysis of the interviews: (a) The oncologist and teleconsultation; (b) Clinical motivations for using teleconsultation; (c) Comparison between teleconsultation and in-person consultation; (d) Advantages and disadvantages of teleconsultation; (e) Technical modalities of teleconsultation; (f) Role of Covid and confinement in the use of teleconsultation; (h) Epistemic judgments about teleconsultation. Optimal teleconsultation occurs when seamlessly incorporated into patient care, offering reduced patient inconvenience, and providing economic and environmental benefits. Although there's a lack of unified agreement in research literature regarding time efficiency, teleconsultation facilitates more customized patient monitoring and addresses the challenge of ""medical deserts"" nationally. Considering patient preferences is crucial when contemplating the use of teleconsultation. Predominantly, technical issues stand as the principal barriers to teleconsultation implementation. CONCLUSION: Even after the end of the health crisis, teleconsultation is still used in clinical practice. Recommendations for effective use are suggested.",2023,Jan-Dec,Digit Health,9,,20552076231215906,,10.1177/20552076231215906,38033511,#655,Lantheaume 2023,,,0
Videoconferencing of Movement-Based and Psychologically Informed Interventions for Chronic Pain: A Systematic Review and Horizon Scan.,Burke C; Rossitch SS; Bejarano G; Knisely M; Ford CG; Allen KD; Ma J; Blalock DV; Ear B; Cantrell S; Gordon AM; Van Voorhees E; Goldstein KM; Williams JW; Gierisch JM,"Introduction: With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, use of telehealth technology increased dramatically. Nonpharmacological approaches to pain management may be well suited for virtual care. Yet, it is not widely understood if this treatment modality is effective when delivered via videoconferencing. This review examines the effectiveness of movement-based and psychologically informed chronic pain management interventions delivered via videoconferencing compared to in-person care. Methods: Searches of MEDLINE(®) (via Ovid(®)), Embase (via Elsevier), CINAHL Complete (via EBSCO), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (via Ovid) were performed from inception to June 10, 2021. All articles meeting eligibility criteria were included for data abstraction. Results: Eight thousand two hundred fifty-two citations were identified, and after removing duplicates, 4,661 citations remained. One study investigating acceptance and commitment therapy met eligibility criteria. The noninferiority randomized trial found no statistically significant difference in outcomes between delivery modalities. A horizon scan was conducted to assess planned or recent studies. Horizon scan results yielded six protocols in trial databases, one pilot study, and three published protocols for ongoing studies. Discussion: Findings from this study indicate that virtually delivered pain management is a possible substitute for in-person care. Given the paucity of evidence on this topic, further comparative and adequately powered studies that assess the impact of movement-based and psychologically informed pain management delivered via videoconferencing are needed. Conclusions: Research is needed to understand patient preferences of such interventions within a variety of settings. Such evaluations will be needed to guide clinical and operations practice to optimize equitable deployment and access to high-quality health care delivered via videoconferencing.",2023,Sep,Telemed J E Health,29,9,1275-1288,,10.1089/tmj.2022.0308,36787486,#951,Burke 2023,,,0
Understanding Intraoperative Transfusion Decision-Making Variability: A Qualitative Study.,Lenet T; Tropiano J; Skanes S; Ivankovic V; Verret M; McIsaac DI; Tinmouth A; Nicholls SG; Patey AM; Fergusson DA; Martel G,"There is evidence of significant intraoperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion variability that cannot be explained by case-mix, and may reflect unwarranted transfusions. The objective was to explore the source of intraoperative RBC transfusion variability by eliciting the beliefs of anesthesiologists and surgeons that underlie transfusion decisions. Interviews based on the Theoretical Domains Framework were conducted to identify beliefs about intraoperative transfusion. Content analysis was performed to group statements into domains. Relevant domains were selected based on frequency of beliefs, perceived influence on transfusion, and the presence of conflicting beliefs within domains. Of the 28 transfusion experts recruited internationally (16 anesthesiologists, 12 surgeons), 24 (86%) were Canadian or American and 11 (39%) identified as female. Eight relevant domains were identified: (1) Knowledge (insufficient evidence to guide intraoperative transfusion), (2) Social/professional role and identity (surgeons/anesthesiologists share responsibility for transfusions), (3) Beliefs about consequences (concerns about morbidity of transfusion/anemia), (4) Environmental context/resources (transfusions influenced by type of surgery, local blood supply, cost of transfusion), (5) Social influences (institutional culture, judgment by peers, surgeon-anesthesiologist relationship, patient preference influencing transfusion decisions), (6) Behavioral regulation (need for intraoperative transfusion guidelines, usefulness of audits and educational sessions to guide transfusion), (7) Nature of the behaviors (overtransfusion remains commonplace, transfusion practice becoming more restrictive over time), and (8) Memory, attention, and decision processes (various patient and operative characteristics are incorporated into transfusion decisions). This study identified a range of factors underlying intraoperative transfusion decision-making and partly explain the variability in transfusion behavior. Targeted theory-informed behavior-change interventions derived from this work could help reduce intraoperative transfusion variability.",2023,Apr,Transfus Med Rev,37,2,150726,,10.1016/j.tmrv.2023.150726,37315996,#1340,Lenet 2023,,,0

Patients have choices among systemic AD treatments that offer varied benefit-risk profiles. OBJECTIVE: Measure patients' willingness to trade off the risks and benefits of systemic treatments among individuals with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of moderate-to-severe AD. METHODS: Patients participated in a discrete choice experiment online survey with a series of choices between hypothetical AD treatments defined by six attributes reflecting benefits and risks of treatments (itch reduction, time until noticeable itch reduction, chance of clear or almost clear skin, risk of serious infection, risk of developing acne, and need for prescription topical steroids). Data were analyzed with a random parameters logit model to quantify preferences and the relative importance of attributes for treatment alternatives. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 200) placed the highest relative importance on itch reduction, speed of itch reduction, and skin clearance, and were generally willing to accept clinically relevant levels of risk of serious infection and acne in exchange for treatment benefits.

The DCE data were analyzed using a random parameters logit model. Subgroup analysis was used to investigate preference heterogeneity.Results: The results revealed achieving clear or almost clear skin within 3-4 months of treatment was the most important attribute relative to all other study attributes. The results indicated that a topical cream applied twice daily was preferred to systemic treatments. Subgroup analysis revealed that respondents with lower self-assessed disease burden were more likely to choose topical over systemic treatments and less averse to the risk of pain, burning, and/or stinging from the medicine (all other treatment features remaining equal) than respondents with higher self-assessed disease burden.Conclusion: The results of this study can help inform shared decision-making to manage mild-to-moderate AD.",2023,Dec,J Dermatolog Treat,34,1,2215356,,10.1080/09546634.2023.2215356,37259544,#640,Myers 2023,,,1
"Pharmacokinetic characterization, benefits and barriers of subcutaneous administration of monoclonal antibodies in oncology.",Homšek A; Spasić J; Nikolić N; Stanojković T; Jovanović M; Miljković B; Vučićević KM,"OBJECTIVE: Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in oncology are slowly becoming the dominant treatment option for many different cancer types. The main route of administration, infusion, requires extensive product preparations, patient hospitalization and close monitoring. Patient comfort improvement, staff workload reduction and cost savings dictated the development of subcutaneous formulations. The aim of this review is to present pharmacokinetic characteristics of subcutaneous products, discuss the differences between intravenous and subcutaneous routes and to point out the advantages as well as challenges of administration route shift from the formulation development and pharmacometric angle. DATA SOURCES: Food and Drug administration's Purple book database and electronic medicines compendium were used to identify monoclonal antibodies in oncology approved as subcutaneous forms. Using keywords subcutaneous, monoclonal antibodies, pharmacokinetics, model, as well as specific drugs previously identified, both PubMed and ScienceDirect databases were researched. DATA SUMMARY: There are currently six approved subcutaneous onco-monoclonal antibodies on the market. For each of them, exposure to the drug was similar in relation to infusion, treatment effectiveness was the same, administration was well tolerated by the patients and costs of the medical service were reduced. CONCLUSION: Development of subcutaneous forms for existing and emerging new monoclonal antibodies for cancer treatment as well as shifting from administration via infusion should be encouraged due to patient preference, lower costs and overall lack of substantial differences in efficacy and safety between the two routes.",2023,Mar,J Oncol Pharm Pract,29,2,431-440,,10.1177/10781552221137702,36349366,#1481,Homšek 2023,,,0
Risk thresholds for patients to switch between daily tablets and biweekly infusions in second-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a patient preference study.,Parikh ND; Girvan A; Coulter J; Gable J; Poon JL; Kim S; Chatterjee A; Boeri M,"BACKGROUND: Historically, high hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-related mortality has been, in part, due to lack of effective therapies; however, several systemic therapies have been recently approved for HCC treatment, including regorafenib and ramucirumab. These two treatments utilize different routes of administration (four daily tablets and biweekly intravenous infusions, respectively) and have different risks of adverse events (AEs). However, we lack data on patient preferences in balancing the route of administration and risk of AEs in patients with HCC. We aimed to determine patient preferences and trade-offs for second-line treatment in patients with HCC.  METHODS: Patients with advanced or metastatic HCC were recruited through their physicians for this study. Patient preferences were assessed by using a modified threshold technique (TT) design in which respondents were asked two direct-elicitation questions before (assuming same safety and efficacy and only varying mode of administration) and after (incorporating the safety profiles of ramucirumab and regorafenib) the TT series on seven risks of clinically relevant AEs. RESULTS: In total, of the 157 patients recruited by their physicians, 150 were eligible and consented to participate. In the first elicitation question (assuming risk and efficacy were equivalent), 61.3% of patients preferred daily tablets. However, 76.7% of patients preferred the biweekly infusion when the safety profiles of the two available second-line therapies were included. The TT analysis confirmed that preferences for oral administration were not strong enough to balance out the risk of AEs that differentiate the two therapies. DISCUSSION: We found that when patients were asked to choose between a daily, oral medication and a biweekly IV medication for HCC, they were more likely to choose a daily, oral medication if efficacy and safety profiles were the same. However, when risks of AEs representing the safety profiles of two currently available second-line treatments were introduced in a second direct-elicitation question, respondents often selected an IV administration with a safety profile similar to ramucirumab, rather than oral tablets with a safety profile similar to regorafenib. Our findings indicate that the risk profile of a second-line treatment for HCC may be more important than the mode of administration to patients.",2023,Jan,BMC Cancer,23,1,66,,10.1186/s12885-022-10388-8,36658529,#1584,Parikh 2023,,,1
Patient Priorities Concerning Treatment Decisions for Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors Identified by Discrete Choice Experiments.,Anaka M; Chan D; Pattison S; Thawer A; Franco B; Moody L; Jackson C; Segelov E; Singh S,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) have multiple treatment options. Ideally, treatment decisions are shared between physician and patient; however, previous studies suggest that oncologists and patients place different value on treatment attributes such as adverse event (AE) rates. High-quality information on NET patient treatment preferences may facilitate patient-centered decision making by helping clinicians understand patient priorities. METHODS: This study used 2 discrete choice experiments (DCE) to elicit preferences of NET patients regarding advanced midgut and pancreatic NET (pNET) treatments. The DCEs used the ""potentially all pairwise rankings of all possible alternatives"" (PAPRIKA) method. The primary objective was to determine relative utility rankings for treatment attributes, including progression-free survival (PFS), treatment modality, and AE rates. Ranking of attribute profiles matching specific treatments was also determined. Levels for treatment attributes were obtained from randomized clinical trial data of NET treatments. RESULTS: One hundred and 10 participants completed the midgut NET DCE, and 132 completed the pNET DCE. Longer PFS was the highest ranked treatment attribute in 64.5% of participants in the midgut NET DCE, and in 59% in the pNET DCE. Approximately, 40% of participants in both scenarios prioritized lower AE rates or less invasive treatment modalities over PFS. Ranking of treatment profiles in the midgut NET scenario identified 60.9% of participants favoring peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), and 30.0% somatostatin analogue dose escalation. CONCLUSION: NET patients have heterogeneous priorities when choosing between treatment options based on the results of 2 independent DCEs. These results highlight the importance of shared decision making for NET patients.",2024,Mar,Oncologist,29,3,227-234,,10.1093/oncolo/oyad312,38007397,#267,Anaka 2024,,,1
Collagenase Treatment Versus Needle Fasciotomy for Single-Digit Dupuytren Contractures: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,Zhang D; Earp BE; Blazar P,"PURPOSE: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the available randomized controlled trial data comparing needle fasciotomy and collagenase treatment for single-digit Dupuytren contractures with a minimum of 3-year follow-up and determine whether one treatment is superior regarding contracture correction and functional outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching four databases for randomized controlled trials investigating the single-digit treatment outcomes for Dupuytren contracture comparing collagenase treatment and needle fasciotomy with a minimum of 3-year follow-up. The risk of bias of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model in anticipation of unobserved heterogeneity. The primary outcome measure was contracture recurrence. Secondary outcome measures included final fixed flexion contracture (FFC), Quick Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) scores, and Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main (URAM) scores. RESULTS: After screening 264 articles, 4 randomized clinical trials were eligible for final inclusion. One trial had a high risk of bias, and two trials had some concern for bias. The final meta-analysis included 347 patients, 169 who underwent collagenase treatment and 178 who underwent needle fasciotomy. No significant differences were noted between the groups in contracture recurrence, FFC, and URAM scores. The pooled data showed a higher QuickDASH score in the collagenase treatment group compared with the needle fasciotomy group, but the observed difference was less than what would be expected to be clinically relevant. CONCLUSIONS: Needle fasciotomy and collagenase treatment have similar outcomes with regards to contracture recurrence, final FFC, QuickDASH scores, and URAM scores for the single-digit treatment for Dupuytren contracture at a minimum of 3-year follow-up. Relevant factors that may be considered during the shared decision-making process for treatment selection include surgeon and patient preferences, costs of treatment, and the disparate complication profiles of these two treatments.

"""If Not Me, Then Who?"": Exploring the Challenges Experienced by Front-Line Clinicians Screening for, and Communicating About, Domestic Violence in the Emergency Department.",Sargeant S; Baird K; Sweeny A; Torpie T,"Screening for domestic violence in healthcare settings increases detection. The emergency department (ED) is one setting where victims frequently attend with injuries and illnesses sustained from violence. However, screening rates remain suboptimal. There is little research about how formal screening occurs, or how less structured interactions are negotiated within the ED context. This article explores this important, but non-mandatory procedure within the context of clinician-patient interactions in Australia. A descriptive qualitative study was undertaken with 21 clinicians across seven EDs in Australia. Thematic analysis was undertaken by two researchers. Results indicate a lack of confidence around DV screening, and tensions in clinicians initiating conversation while managing their own emotional stressors. No participants expressed knowledge of formal screening processes in their workplaces. Successful DV screening programs must provide clinicians with the tools to minimize perceived discomfort in initiating and sustaining conversations while accepting patient preferences regarding disclosure.",2023,Oct,Violence Against Women,29,12-13,2508-2526,,10.1177/10778012231186816,37415519,#829,Sargeant 2023,,,0
HTA community perspectives on the use of patient preference information: lessons learned from a survey with members of HTA bodies.,Hiligsmann M; Liden B; Beaudart C; Germeni E; Hanna A; Joshi M; Koola CP; Stein B; Tonkinson M; Marshall D; Fifer S,"This research sought to assess whether and how patient preference (PP) data are currently used within health technology assessment (HTA) bodies and affiliated organizations involved in technology/drug appraisals and assessments. An exploratory survey was developed by the PP Project Subcommittee of the HTA International Patient and Citizen Involvement Interest Group to gain insight into the use, impact, and role of PP data in HTA, as well as the perceived barriers to its incorporation. Forty members of HTA bodies and affiliated organizations from twelve countries completed the online survey. PP data were reported to be formally considered as part of the HTA evidence review process by 82.5 percent of the respondents, while 39.4 percent reported that most of the appraisals and assessments within their organization in the past year had submitted PP data. The leading reason for why PP data were not submitted in most assessments was time/resource constraints followed by lack of clarity on PP data impact. Participants reported that PP data had a moderate level of influence on the deliberative process and outcome of the decision, but a higher level of influence on the decision's quality. Most (81.8 percent) felt patient advocacy groups should be primarily responsible for generating and submitting this type of evidence. Insights from the survey confirm the use of PP data in HTA but reveal barriers to its broader and more meaningful integration. Encouragingly, participants believe obstacles can be overcome, paving the way for a second phase of research involving in-depth collaborative workshops with HTA representatives.",2024,Mar,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,40,1,e17,,10.1017/S0266462324000138,38439624,#262,Hiligsmann 2024,,,0
Pressure-garment therapy for preventing hypertrophic scarring after burn injury.,Harris IM; Lee KC; Deeks JJ; Moore DJ; Moiemen NS; Dretzke J,"BACKGROUND: Burn damage to skin often results in scarring; however in some individuals the failure of normal wound-healing processes results in excessive scar tissue formation, termed 'hypertrophic scarring'. The most commonly used method for the prevention and treatment of hypertrophic scarring is pressure-garment therapy (PGT). PGT is considered standard care globally; however, there is continued uncertainty around its effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of pressure-garment therapy for the prevention of hypertrophic scarring after burn injury. SEARCH METHODS: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trials registers on 8 June 2023 with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PGT (alone or in combination with other scar-management therapies) with scar management therapies not including PGT, or comparing different PGT pressures or different types of PGT. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion using predetermined inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 15 studies in this review (1179 participants), 14 of which (1057 participants) presented useable data. The sample size of included studies ranged from 17 to 159 participants. Most studies included both adults and children. Eight studies compared a pressure garment (with or without another scar management therapy) with scar management therapy alone, five studies compared the same pressure garment at a higher pressure versus a lower pressure, and two studies compared two different types of pressure garments. Studies used a variety of pressure garments (e.g. in-house manufactured or a commercial brand). Types of scar management therapies included were lanolin massage, topical silicone gel, silicone sheet/dressing, and heparin sodium ointment. Meta-analysis was not possible as there was significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies. Main outcome measures were scar improvement assessed using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) or the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) (or both), pain, pruritus, quality of life, adverse events, and adherence to therapy. Studies additionally reported a further 14 outcomes, mostly individual scar parameters, some of which contributed to global scores on the VSS or POSAS. The amount of evidence for each individual outcome was limited. Most studies had a short follow-up, which may have affected results as the full effect of any therapy on scar healing may not be seen until around 18 months. PGT versus no treatment/lanolin We included five studies (378 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on whether PGT improves scars as assessed by the VSS compared with no treatment/lanolin. The evidence is also very uncertain for pain, pruritus, adverse events, and adherence. No study used the POSAS or assessed quality of life. One additional study (122 participants) did not report useable data. PGT versus silicone We included three studies (359 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of PGT compared with silicone, as assessed by the VSS and POSAS. The evidence is also very uncertain for pain, pruritus, quality of life, adverse events, adherence, and other scar parameters. It is possible that silicone may result in fewer adverse events or better adherence compared with PGT but this was also based on very low-certainty evidence. PGT plus silicone versus no treatment/lanolin We included two studies (200 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on whether PGT plus silicone improves scars as assessed by the VSS compared with no treatment/lanolin. The evidence is also very uncertain for pain, pruritus, and adverse events. No study used the POSAS or assessed quality of life or adherence. PGT plus silicone versus silicone We included three studies (359 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of PGT plus silicone compared with silicone, as assessed by the VSS and POSAS. The evidence is also very uncertain for pain, pruritus, quality of life, adverse events, and adherence. PGT plus scar management therapy including silicone versus scar management therapy including silicone We included one study (88 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of PGT plus scar management therapy including silicone versus scar management therapy including silicone, as assessed by the VSS and POSAS. The evidence is also very uncertain for pain, pruritus, quality of life, adverse events, and adherence. High-pressure versus low-pressure garments We included five studies (262 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of high pressure versus low pressure PGT on adverse events and adherence. No study used the VSS or the POSAS or assessed pain, pruritus, or quality of life. Different types of PGT (Caroskin Tricot + an adhesive silicone gel sheet versus Gecko Nanoplast (silicone gel bandage)) We included one study (60 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of Caroskin Tricot versus Gecko Nanoplast on the POSAS, pain, pruritus, and adverse events. The study did not use the VSS or assess quality of life or adherence. Different types of pressure garments (Jobst versus Tubigrip) We included one study (110 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the adherence to either Jobst or Tubigrip. This study did not report any other outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to recommend using either PGT or an alternative for preventing hypertrophic scarring after burn injury. PGT is already commonly used in practice and it is possible that continuing to do so may provide some benefit to some people. However, until more evidence becomes available, it may be appropriate to allow patient preference to guide therapy.",2024,Jan,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,1,1,CD013530,,10.1002/14651858.CD013530.pub2,38189494,#490,Harris 2024,,,0
Experiences of patients and next of kin on informed consent process for emergency surgery in two Urban university teaching hospitals in Uganda: a comparative cross sectional study.,Kituuka O; Mwaka E; Munabi I; Galukande M,"Informed consent for emergency surgery is a process in which a patient or their next of kin must make quick decisions required for surgery in a life-threatening situation or surgery that may have life-altering outcomes. The objective of the study was to describe patients and their next of kin experiences and factors influencing the informed consent process in two urban university teaching hospitals in Uganda. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey involving patients who underwent emergency surgery and their next of kin was conducted in two tertiary care hospitals; one public and one private-not-for profit institution. A questionnaire was administered to collect sociodemographic information, type of Surgery that was done, how informed consent was obtained and experiences and expectations from the informed consent process. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the variables was done. RESULTS: We collected data from 210 patients from a public hospital and 170 from a private-not-for profit hospital. Overall, most patients did not have the risks of the surgery communicated to them (79.7%), were not given alternative options (87.6%) and had no opportunity to ask questions (57.4%). Patients at the private institution had 3.35 times the odds of expecting the consent form to be explained to them than those at the public institution. Patients at the public hospital had 0.12 times the odds of preferring to have consent administered by a nurse than patients at the private institution OR 0.12 (0.05-0.29, p < 0.001). Patients in the public institution had 0.18 times the odds of preferring to have consent administered by a doctor than patients in the private institution OR 0.18 (0.08-0.45, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients in both public and private institutions are not informed about the risks of surgery, alternative options and are not given the opportunity to ask questions. Interpretation of the findings of this study on patient preferences on who administered consent though statistically significant were inconclusive due to the responses not being mutually exclusive.",2023,Aug,BMC Emerg Med,23,1,82,,10.1186/s12873-023-00856-0,37532992,#993,Kituuka 2023,,,0
Arteriovenous fistula aneurysmorrhaphy is associated with improved patency and decreased vascular access abandonment.,Chang R; Alabi O; Mahajan A; Miller JS; Bhat KR; Mize BM; Khader MA; Teodorescu V,"BACKGROUND: Upper extremity hemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) can become aneurysmal over time due to repeated cannulation and/or outflow steno-occlusive disease. The optimal surgical management of aneurysmal AVFs (aneurysmorrhaphy vs interposition graft) has remained unclear. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review in which current procedural terminology codes were used to screen for patients who had undergone surgical treatment of aneurysmal AVFs between 2016 and 2021 at a single hospital system. The patients were included after a review of the operative reports. The cases were divided by surgical procedure (aneurysmorrhaphy vs interposition graft placement). The patients who had undergone primary AVF ligation or other types of repair were excluded. The primary outcomes were primary assisted and secondary patency, and the secondary outcome was dialysis access abandonment. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to test the association between the type of AVF aneurysm repair and the primary and secondary outcomes. RESULTS: From 2016 to 2021, 6951 patients had undergone 16,190 dialysis access procedures. Of these procedures, 381 (2.4%) were related to surgical treatment of an aneurysmal AVF. We excluded 58 primary AVF ligation cases and 20 cases involving other types of repair, leaving 303 cases for analysis. These were divided into two groups: aneurysmorrhaphy (n = 123; 41%) and interposition graft (n = 180; 59%). No differences were found between the groups in male gender (68% vs 63%), hypertension (98% vs 98%), or central stenosis (14% vs 22%). The patients who had undergone aneurysmorrhaphy were younger (median age, 54 years vs 59 years); had had a lower rate of diabetes (41% vs 59%), coronary artery disease (41% vs 58%), and congestive heart failure (41% vs 55%); and were less likely to have undergone upper arm access (72% vs 92%). The median follow-up was 11.1 months (interquartile range, 3.6-25.2 months). No differences were found in the incidence of 30-day wound complications (1% vs 3%) or surgical site infections (4% vs 6%). On multivariable Cox regression, interposition graft placement was associated with the loss of primary assisted patency (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-4.95), loss of secondary patency (aHR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.21-7.94), and abandonment of dialysis access (aHR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.61-5.87; P < .05 for all) at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: AVF aneurysmorrhaphy was associated with improved primary assisted and secondary patency and decreased abandonment of dialysis access. We suggest using aneurysmorrhaphy when AVF aneurysms are indicated for repair. However, individual factors such as patient comorbidities, AVF anatomy, remaining dialysis access options, and patient preference should be considered when planning the surgical approach.",2023,Mar,J Vasc Surg,77,3,891-898.e1,,10.1016/j.jvs.2022.10.054,36368647,#1480,Chang 2023,,,0
Similar outcomes of arteriovenous fistulae created under general or regional anesthesia.,Drouven JW; Fernhout MH; de Bruin C; van Roon AM; Bokkers RP; Zeebregts CJ,"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that type of anesthesia can significantly change vascular access surgery outcomes. Still, there is limited evidence on the impact of regional anesthesia (RA) on patency and failure rates compared to general anesthesia (GA). The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of RA and GA in patients who underwent vascular access creation at our center. METHODS: Data collected in our prospectively maintained database of patients with chronic renal dysfunction requiring hemodialysis were analyzed, 464 patients were included. Outcome parameters such as maturation, primary failure, postoperative flow measurements, patency rates, and survival outcomes were compared between RA and GA groups. RESULTS: In this study 489 vascular access procedures were performed in 464 patients, 318 included in the RA group and 171 in the GA group. Median follow-up time was 29.9 (IQR 37.3) months in the RA group versus 33.0 (IQR 40.7) in the GA group (p = 0.252). Anesthesia type did not significantly affect patient survival (HR, 1.01; CI, 0.70-1.45; p = 0.976). No significant differences were found in vascular access flow volume, primary failure, or time to cannulation between the RA and GA groups for both radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae and brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae. Anesthesia type did not significantly change patency outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, both RA and GA demonstrate similar results regarding patient survival, maturation, failure, or patency after vascular access creation. Still, patient-specific factors for each type of anesthesia as well as patient preference should be considered.",2023,Nov,J Vasc Access,,,11297298231214101,,10.1177/11297298231214101,37997150,#665,Drouven 2023,,,0
Barriers and Facilitators to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis by Men Who Have Sex with Men and Community Stakeholders in Malaysia.,Rosen AO; Wickersham JA; Altice FL; Khati A; Azwa I; Tee V; Jeri-Wahrhaftig A; Luces JR; Ni Z; Kamarulzaman A; Saifi R; Shrestha R,"BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) in Malaysia are disproportionately affected by HIV. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an evidence-based HIV prevention strategy; yet, uptake remains low among Malaysian MSM, who have a limited understanding of barriers to PrEP. METHODS: We employed the nominal group technique (NGT), a structured mixed-methods strategy to understand the barriers and facilitators to PrEP use among Malaysian MSM, combined with a qualitative focus group. Six virtual focus group sessions, three among MSM (n = 20) and three among stakeholders (n = 16), were conducted using a video-conferencing platform. Rank-ordering of barriers from NGT was recorded, and thematic analysis was conducted for content. RESULTS: Similar barriers were reported by MSM and community stakeholders, with aggregated costs associated with PrEP care (e.g., consultation with a clinician, medication, laboratory testing) being the greatest barrier, followed by limited knowledge and awareness of PrEP. Additionally, the lack of access to PrEP providers, the complex clinical protocol for PrEP initiation and follow-up, and social stigma undermined PrEP delivery. Qualitative discussions identified potential new strategies to overcome these barriers, including expanded outreach efforts to reach hard-to-reach MSM, a 'one-stop' delivery model for PrEP services, a patient-centered decision aid to guide PrEP uptake, and easy access to LGBT-friendly PrEP providers. CONCLUSION: Current barriers may be overcome through governmental subsidy for PrEP and evidence-informed shared decision aids to support both MSM and PrEP providers.",2023,Apr,Int J Environ Res Public Health,20,9,,,10.3390/ijerph20095669,37174187,#1311,Rosen 2023,,,0
Peri-procedural and mid-term follow-up age-related differences in leadless pacemaker implantation: Insights from a multicenter European registry.,Gulletta S; Schiavone M; Gasperetti A; Breitenstein A; Palmisano P; Mitacchione G; Chierchia GB; Montemerlo E; Statuto G; Russo G; Casella M; Vitali F; Mazzone P; Hofer D; Arabia G; Moltrasio M; Lipartiti F; Fierro N; Bertini M; Dello Russo A; Pisanò ECL; Biffi M; Rovaris G; de Asmundis C; Tondo C; Curnis A; Della Bella P; Saguner AM; Forleo GB,"BACKGROUND: Age-related differences on leadless pacemaker (LP) are poorly described. Aim of this study was to compare clinical indications, periprocedural and mid-term device-associated outcomes in a large real-world cohort of LP patients, stratified by age at implantation. METHODS: Two cohorts of younger and older patients (≤50 and > 50 years old) were retrieved from the iLEAPER registry. The primary outcome was to compare the underlying indication why a LP was preferred over a transvenous PM across the two cohorts. Rates of peri-procedural and mid-term follow-up major complications as well as LP electrical performance were deemed secondary outcomes. RESULTS: 1154 patients were enrolled, with younger patients representing 6.2% of the entire cohort. Infective and vascular concerns were the most frequent characteristics that led to a LP implantation in the older cohort (45.8% vs 67.7%, p < 0.001; 4.2% vs 16.4%, p = 0.006), while patient preference was the leading cause to choose a LP in the younger (47.2% vs 5.6%, p < 0.001). Median overall procedural (52 [40-70] vs 50 [40-65] mins) and fluoroscopy time were similar in both groups. 4.3% of patients experienced periprocedural complications, without differences among groups. Threshold values were higher in the younger, both at discharge and at last follow-up (0.63 [0.5-0.9] vs 0.5 [0.38-0-7] V, p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: When considering LP indications, patient preference was more common in younger, while infective and vascular concerns were more frequent in the older cohort. Rates of device-related complications did not differ significantly. Younger patients tended to have a slightly higher pacing threshold at mid-term follow-up.",2023,Jan,Int J Cardiol,371,,197-203,,10.1016/j.ijcard.2022.09.026,36115442,#1588,Gulletta 2023,,,0
Development of an exercise therapy referral clinical support tool for patients with osteoporosis at risk for falls.,Bullock GS; Duncan P; Chandler AM; Aguilar AA; Latham N; Storer T; Alexander N; McDonough CM,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to develop a clinical support tool for osteoporosis clinic providers to support risk assessment and referrals for evidence-based exercise therapy programs. METHODS: A sequential Delphi method was used with a multidisciplinary group of national falls experts, to provide consensus on referral to exercise therapy for patients at risk for falls. The Delphi study included a primary research team, expert panel, and clinical partners to answer the questions: (1) ""What patient characteristics are needed to develop a clinical support tool?""; (2) ""What are the recommended exercise referrals for patients with osteoporosis at risk for falls?"" The consensus process consisted of two rounds with 8 weeks between meetings. Two qualitative researchers analyzed the data using a modified version of a matrix analysis approach. RESULTS: The following were the most important variables to include when determining exercise therapy referrals for patients with osteoporosis: Patient history and demographics, falls history over the last year, current physical function and balance, caregiver and transportation status, socioeconomic and insurance status, and patient preference. Potential exercise therapy referrals included one-on-one physical therapy, group physical therapy, home health, community-based exercise programs, and not acceptable for exercise therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patient characteristics including patient history, physical function and balance performance, socioeconomic and insurance status, and patient preference for exercise therapy are important to inform both the medical provider and patient with osteoporosis to choose the most appropriate exercise therapy referral. Adoption of the algorithmic suggestions may have a significant impact on uptake and adherence to exercise therapy, ultimately improving patient physical function and reducing falls risk.",2024,Feb,J Am Geriatr Soc,,,,,10.1111/jgs.18796,38344943,#376,Bullock 2024,,,0
"Cognitive-behavioural versus cognitive-analytic guided self-help for mild-to-moderate anxiety: a pragmatic, randomised patient preference trial.",Kellett S; Bee C; Smithies J; Aadahl V; Simmonds-Buckley M; Power N; Dugen-Williams C; Fallon N; Delgadillo J,"BACKGROUND: Guided self-help (GSH) for anxiety is widely implemented in primary care services because of service efficiency gains, but there is also evidence of poor acceptability, low effectiveness and relapse. AIMS: The aim was to compare preferences for, acceptability and efficacy of cognitive-behavioural guided self-help (CBT-GSH) versus cognitive-analytic guided self-help (CAT-GSH). METHOD: This was a pragmatic, randomised, patient preference trial (Clinical trials identifier: NCT03730532). The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was the primary outcome at 8- and 24-week follow-up. Interventions were delivered competently on the telephone via structured workbooks over 6-8 (30-35 min) sessions by trained practitioners. RESULTS: A total of 271 eligible participants were included, of whom 19 (7%) accepted being randomised and 252 (93%) chose their treatment. In the preference cohort, 181 (72%) chose CAT-GSH and 71 (28%) preferred CBT-GSH. BAI outcomes in the preference and randomised cohorts did not differ at 8 weeks (-0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.52 to 2.92) or 24 weeks (0.85, 95% CI -2.87 to 4.57). After controlling for allocation method and baseline covariates, there were no differences between CAT-GSH and CBT-GSH at 8 weeks (F(1, 263) = 0.22, P = 0.639) or at 24 weeks (F(1, 263) = 0.22, P = 0.639). Mean BAI change from baseline was a reduction of 9.28 for CAT-GSH and 9.78 for CBT-GSH at 8 weeks and 12.90 for CAT-GSH and 12.43 for CBT-GSH at 24 weeks.

Discharge of Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients on Sub-Optimal Dual Anti-Platelet Therapy: A Single Center Experience.,Booker J; Nihart A; Campen M; Medrano-Rodriguez E; Blankenship J,"PURPOSE: To identify and quantify the reasons why acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing stenting at University of New Mexico Hospital were prescribed sub-optimal dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) at discharge, and to identify practice patterns that could potentially lead to improved DAPT treatment for these patients. METHODS: We reviewed electronic medical records and cardiac catheterization records of 326 patients who underwent PCI at UNMH between January 1, 2021, and June 30, 2022 and identified 229 ACS patients who survived until discharge. Demographic and clinical characteristics relevant to P2Y(12) selection were obtained from a review of medical records. Pharmacists' notes that documented their efforts to get appropriate insurance coverage and reasons for discharge on clopidogrel rather than ticagrelor were reviewed. Patients discharged on aspirin and clopidogrel underwent review of medical records and cardiac catheterization lab records to determine if the discharge P2Y(12) drug was appropriate. Reasons for inappropriately discharge on clopidogrel were categorized as cost/insurance, patient preference, concern for daily adherence to a twice-daily medication, and on clopidogrel before PCI and not switched to ticagrelor afterward. RESULTS: The 229 ACS patients included (38.0%, n = 87) appropriately discharged on ticagrelor/prasugrel, (27.5%, n = 63) appropriately discharged on clopidogrel, (32.8%, n = 75) inappropriately discharged on clopidogrel, and (1.7%, n = 4) not discharged on a P2Y(12) inhibitor. For patients inappropriately discharged on clopidogrel (n = 75), the most common reasons were cost or lack of insurance (n = 56) and clinical inertia (taking clopidogrel before PCI and maintained on it afterward) (n = 17). Inappropriate DAPT at discharge correlated with lack of insurance (90.5% compared to 39.7% in patients with insurance, P < 0.001) but not with ethnicity. CONCLUSION: At the University of New Mexico, a safety-net hospital, increasing financially restricted access to ticagrelor could help up to 24.5% of ACS patients reduce their risk of ischemic events. For patients admitted on clopidogrel DAPT, upgrading to ticagrelor could reduce ischemic risk in 7.4% of ACS patients. Expanding healthcare insurance coverage might redue sub-optimal DAPT coverage.",2023,Oct,Res Sq,,,,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-3425525/v1,37886454,#771,Booker 2023,,,0
Quality of prenatal and postpartum telehealth visits during COVID-19 and preferences for future care.,Marshall C; Gutierrez S; Hecht H; Logan R; Kerns J; Diamond-Smith N,"BACKGROUND: At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth practices for pregnancy-related care were rapidly implemented. Telehealth for pregnancy-related care is likely to continue after the pandemic. In order for health systems and clinicians to provide person-centered pregnancy-related care via telehealth, it is critical to understand patients' telehealth experiences and their preferences regarding the use of telehealth moving forward. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe perceived quality of prenatal and postpartum telehealth visits during COVID-19 and to examine the association between telehealth quality during the pandemic and future telehealth preferences. STUDY DESIGN: We used data from of an online sample of US women aged 18 to 45 years seeking reproductive health care during COVID-19. Two cross-sections of survey data were collected in July 2020 and January 2021. This analysis included those who sought prenatal (n=1496) or postpartum (n=482) care during the pandemic. Among those who had a prenatal or postpartum telehealth visit, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between a measure of perceived telehealth quality and openness to future telehealth visits, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 57.5% of prenatal and 52.9% of postpartum respondents had a telehealth appointment. Respondents agreed with most statements about the quality of their telehealth appointments, with ≥80% reporting that they were convenient, easy, safe, and provided good information. Lower-ranked quality items were related to visits feeling personal and the patient feeling cared for. A total of 35.2% of prenatal (n=816) and 43.3% of postpartum (n=231) respondents expressed openness to telehealth visits in the future. Prenatal and postpartum respondents reporting higher telehealth quality had increased odds of being open to telehealth in the future (prenatal: adjusted odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-1.3; postpartum: adjusted odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.3). CONCLUSION: Prenatal and postpartum respondents with better telehealth experiences were more likely to express openness to telehealth in the future, although most preferred future in-person visits. As pregnancy-related telehealth continues, it is important to offer appointment options that match patient preferences, especially populations that face barriers in access to care, and to explore ways to personalize care and support positive patient-provider relationships.",2023,Feb,AJOG Glob Rep,3,1,100139,,10.1016/j.xagr.2022.100139,36465317,#1553,Marshall 2023,,,0
Sequencing Systemic Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,Ponvilawan B; Roth MT,"Multiple treatment options are now approved for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-containing regimen should be highly considered as the first-line treatment when there is no contraindication, especially in those with hepatitis virus-related HCC, due to proven superior overall survival (OS) compared to sorafenib. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab remain the treatment of choice among all ICI-containing regimens, unless contraindications to either of the medications exist. Although sorafenib is still the only medication currently approved for select patients with Child-Pugh B (CP) HCC in the first-line setting, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is being studied in this patient population. Moreover, patients with post-liver transplantation recurrence may benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), while more studies are still needed to determine the safety of ICIs in this setting. Interestingly, multiple potential biomarkers, including tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI) status, and PD-L1 expression level, have inconsistently predicted response to ICIs in patients with HCC. Limited evidence is available to guide treatment choice in later-line settings after progressing on ICIs, and decisions should be based on the safety profile of the treatment regimen and patient preference. Multiple trials are ongoing to elucidate the optimal treatment sequence. Of note, we believe that TKIs (e.g., cabozantinib, regorafenib, lenvatinib, and sorafenib) could be more beneficial in later-line settings to broaden inhibition of other pathways apart from vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). When conventional treatment options are exhausted, tissue biopsy may be helpful to reveal rare targetable mutations, such as RET gene fusions.",2023,Nov,Curr Treat Options Oncol,24,11,1580-1597,,10.1007/s11864-023-01135-7,37843628,#712,Ponvilawan 2023,,,0
Patients who have undergone total shoulder arthroplasty prefer greater surgeon involvement in shared decision making.,Raji Y; Strony JT; Moon TJ; Smith KL; Sivasundaram L; Renko N; Victoroff BN; Gillespie RJ,"BACKGROUND: There has been a shift in medical decision making from a paternalist model to a shared decision-making (SDM) approach, described as a patient-physician relationship where both parties collaborate to arrive on an evidence-based treatment regimen that best suits the patient's needs and values. However, there is a scarcity in evidence regarding SDM in shoulder arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to evaluate overall patient preference for SDM and determine demographic and socioeconomic factors related to SDM preference in those undergoing shoulder arthroplasty. METHODS: Patients aged 40-89 years who had undergone a total shoulder arthroplasty were enrolled. Two-part questionnaires were administered collecting patient demographic information and SDM subscale scores postoperatively. Bivariate and multivariate regression models were used to determine factors associated with SDM Total and subscale scores. RESULTS: A total of 125 patients (53 male; mean age, 69.5 ± 10.4 years) who had undergone primary total shoulder arthroplasty were included. The mean Total SDM score was -2.24 ± 1.9 and the Preoperative, Operative, and Postoperative SDM subscale scores were -1.54 ± 2.0, -2.59 ± 2.2, and -2.48 ± 2.1, respectively, indicating a preference for SDM in the Preoperative subscale and surgeon-driven decision making in the total score and other 2 subscales. Multivariate regression models demonstrated a preference for surgeon decision making at both the 4-12-week postoperative period for the Preoperative subscale (odds ratio [OR] -1.03, 95% CI -2.0, -0.1, P = .039) and the 2-4-week postoperative period for the Operative subscale (OR -1.74, 95% CI -3.4, -0.1, P = .038) when compared to patients at the 2-week postoperative period. No other variables were significantly associated with any of the SDM subscale scores or Total SDM score. CONCLUSION: Patients reported a more passive role in the decision-making process with an overall preference for a surgeon-led approach in primary total shoulder arthroplasty. Patients preferred a shared decision-making approach in regard to preoperative considerations but indicated a significant preference for surgeon-led decision making regarding day of surgery decisions. There were no correlations between SDM scores and age, sex, race, income, education level, insurance type, or treating surgeon. Overall, patients demonstrated a predilection for an SDM approach for preoperative considerations, contrary to those decisions associated with the day of surgery and postoperative care.",2023,Mar,J Shoulder Elbow Surg,32,3,645-652,,10.1016/j.jse.2022.09.016,36273791,#1485,Raji 2023,,,0
Utility of Platelet-Rich Plasma Therapy in the Management of Meniscus Injuries: A narrative review.,El Zouhbi A; Yammine J; Hemdanieh M; Korbani ET; Nassereddine M,"Menisci are crucial for knee joint functions and meniscal tears are common injuries, especially in sports activities. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which enhances healing, has emerged as a promising additive treatment for meniscus injuries, utilizing the regenerative properties of platelets and growth factors for improved clinical outcomes. In studies with a follow-up period of less than one year, the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy for meniscus injuries showed significant improvements in knee symptoms and daily activity. Patients experienced enhanced outcomes in terms of pain reduction and increased sports activity, with MRI scans indicating stable meniscus conditions after six months. Studies with a follow-up of more than one year, however, did not find significant differences between groups treated with PRP and groups not treated with PRP in terms of various outcome measures, including pain and knee function. The vascularization of the menisci is vital for their proper function, and insufficient blood supply can affect healing of meniscal injuries. PRP therapy is used to enhance meniscal healing by introducing growth factors and anti-inflammatory agents. PRP therapy may enable athletes with meniscal tears to return to sports more quickly and has less rehabilitation duration. While PRP seems promising as an alternative to failed treatment or as an adjunct to treatment in the short term, its long-term effectiveness remains inconclusive. Patient preferences, commitment to therapy rehabilitation, and cost should all be considered on an individual basis.",2024,,Orthop Rev (Pavia),16,,94240,,10.52965/001c.94240,38505136,#230,ElZouhbi 2024,,,0
Understanding and preventing nonadherence and treatment dropout in adolescents and young adults with anxiety and depressive disorders.,Waumans RC; Muntingh ADT; Batelaan NM; van Balkom AJLM,"Dropout from psychological or pharmacological treatment for anxiety and depressive disorders is common. It is especially problematic in adolescents and young adults because of the adverse consequences for their development. Reasons for treatment dropout can be divided into therapy-process related factors, attitudinal aspects, and practical issues.

Real-World Effectiveness of Dolutegravir/Lamivudine in People With HIV-1 in Test-and-Treat Settings or With High Baseline Viral Loads: TANDEM Study Subgroup Analyses.,Benson P; Kuretski J; Donovan C; Harper G; Merrill D; Metzner AA; Mycock K; Wallis H; Brogan AP; Patarroyo J; Oglesby A,"INTRODUCTION: Dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC) was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019 for the treatment of antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive people with HIV-1 based on results from the pivotal GEMINI-1/GEMINI-2 trials. Around that time, immediate initiation of treatment upon diagnosis was recommended in the US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines. Here we report results from 126 treatment-naive people with HIV-1 who initiated DTG/3TC as part of a test-and-treat strategy (n = 61) or with high baseline viral loads (HIV-1 RNA ≥ 100,000 copies/ml; n = 16) from the TANDEM study. METHODS: TANDEM was a US-based, retrospective chart review study that included a cohort of 126 individuals aged ≥ 18 years with no prior history of ART who initiated DTG/3TC before September 30, 2020, and had ≥ 6 months of follow-up. Test-and-treat was defined as ART initiation shortly after diagnosis without available viral load, CD4 + cell count, or HIV-1 resistance data. Outcomes included virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml; overall and by baseline viral load) and discontinuations. Analyses were descriptive. RESULTS: Among 61 individuals who initiated DTG/3TC in a test-and-treat setting (median [interquartile range (IQR)] treatment duration, 1.3 [0.9-1.7] years), 57 (93%) achieved virologic suppression, and 51 (84%) remained suppressed; 1 (< 1%) individual discontinued DTG/3TC due to persistent low-level viremia. The most common healthcare provider (HCP)-reported reason for initiating DTG/3TC was avoidance of long-term toxicities among individuals in the test-and-treat subgroup. Of 16 treatment-naive individuals with high baseline viral loads (median [IQR] treatment duration, 100,000-250,000 copies/ml: 1.2 [0.8-1.8] years; > 250,000 copies/ml: 1.0 [0.7-1.1] years), 14 (88%) achieved virologic suppression, 13 (81%) remained suppressed, and none discontinued DTG/3TC. Patient preference was the most common HCP-reported reason for initiating DTG/3TC in this subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate real-world effectiveness of DTG/3TC, with few discontinuations, in people with HIV-1 in test-and-treat settings or with high baseline viral loads.",2024,Apr,Infect Dis Ther,,,,,10.1007/s40121-024-00950-1,38570444,#172,Benson 2024,,,0
New insights into acupuncture techniques for poststroke spasticity.,Wang JX; Fidimanantsoa OL; Ma LX,"With the trend of aging population getting more obvious, stroke has already been a major public health problem worldwide. As a main disabling motor impairment after stroke, spasticity has unexpected negative impacts on the quality of life and social participation in patients. Moreover, it brings heavy economic burden to the family and society. Previous researches indicated that abnormality of neural modulation and muscle property corelates with the pathogenesis of poststroke spasticity (PSS). So far, there still lacks golden standardized treatment regimen for PSS; furthermore, certain potential adverse-events of the mainstream therapy, for example, drug-induced generalized muscle weakness or high risk related surgery somehow decrease patient preference and compliance, which brings challenges to disease treatment and follow-up care. As an essential non-pharmacological therapy, acupuncture has long been used for PSS in China and shows favorable effects on improvements of spastic hypertonia and motor function. Notably, previous studies focused mainly on the research of antispastic acupoints. In comparison, few studies lay special stress on the other significant factor impacting on acupuncture efficacy, that is acupuncture technique. Based on current evidences from the clinic and laboratory, we will discuss certain new insights into acupuncture technique, in particular the antispastic needling technique, for PSS management in light of its potential effects on central modulations as well as peripheral adjustments, and attempt to provide some suggestions for future studies with respect to the intervention timing and course, application of acupuncture techniques, acupoint selection, predictive and aggravating factors of PSS, aiming at optimization of antispastic acupuncture regimen and improvement of quality of life in stroke patients. More innovations including rigorous study design, valid objective assessments for spasticity, and related experimental studies are worthy to be expected in the years ahead.",2023,,Front Public Health,11,,1155372,,10.3389/fpubh.2023.1155372,37089473,#1331,Wang 2023,,,0
Preferences for Genetic Testing to Predict the Risk of Developing Hereditary Cancer: A Systematic Review of Discrete Choice Experiments.,Morrish N; Snowsill T; Dodman S; Medina-Lara A,"BACKGROUND: Understanding service user preferences is key to effective health care decision making and efficient resource allocation. It is of particular importance in the management of high-risk patients in whom predictive genetic testing can alter health outcomes. PURPOSE: This review aims to identify the relative importance and willingness to pay for attributes of genetic testing in hereditary cancer syndromes. DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, HMIC, Web of Science, and EconLit using discrete choice experiment (DCE) terms combined with terms related to hereditary cancer syndromes, malignancy synonyms, and genetic testing. STUDY SELECTION: Following independent screening by 3 reviewers, 7 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, being a DCE investigating patient or public preferences related to predictive genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes. DATA EXTRACTION: Extracted data included study and respondent characteristics, DCE attributes and levels, methods of data analysis and interpretation, and key study findings. DATA SYNTHESIS: Studies covered colorectal, breast, and ovarian cancer syndromes. Results were summarized in a narrative synthesis and the quality assessed using the Lancsar and Louviere framework. LIMITATIONS: This review focuses only on DCE design and testing for hereditary cancer syndromes rather than other complex diseases. Challenges also arose from heterogeneity in attributes and levels. CONCLUSIONS: Test effectiveness and detection rates were consistently important to respondents and thus should be prioritized by policy makers. Accuracy, cost, and wait time, while also important, showed variation between studies, although overall reduction in cost may improve uptake. Patients and the public would be willing to pay for improved detection and clinician over insurance provider involvement. Future studies should seek to contextualize findings by considering the impact of sociodemographic characteristics, health system coverage, and insurance policies on preferences. HIGHLIGHTS: Test effectiveness and detection rates are consistently important to respondents in genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes.Reducing the cost of genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes may improve uptake.Individuals are most willing to pay for a test that improves detection rates, identifies multiple cancers, and for which results are shared with a doctor rather than with an insurance provider.",2024,Apr,Med Decis Making,44,3,252-268,,10.1177/0272989X241227425,38323553,#186,Morrish 2024,,,1
Patient preferences for active ulcerative colitis treatments and fecal microbiota transplantation.,Marshall DA; MacDonald KV; Kao D; Bernstein CN; Kaplan GG; Jijon H; Hazlewood G; Panaccione R; Nasser Y; Raman M; Moayyedi P,"BACKGROUND: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising treatment for active ulcerative colitis (UC). Understanding patient preferences can identify treatment features that may impact treatment decisions, improve shared decision-making, and contribute to patient-centered care, which is especially important in the context of novel treatments like FMT. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to quantify preferences for active UC treatments, specifically FMT and biologics, and identify patient characteristics associated with different preference patterns. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional survey study. METHODS: We administered a discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey to elicit preferences in a sample of Canadian adults with UC. DCE data were analyzed using a main-effects mixed logit model and used to predict uptake of hypothetical scenarios reflecting alternative combinations of treatment features. Latent class modeling identified heterogeneity in patient preference patterns. RESULTS: Participants' (n = 201) mean age was 47.1 years (SD: 14.5 years), 58% were female, and most (84%) had at least some post-secondary education. Almost half were willing to undergo FMT. When considering treatments for active UC, the most important attributes were chance of remission and severity of rare unknown side effects. All else equal, participants were most likely to uptake treatment that involves oral capsules/pills. Participants in the class with the highest utility for chance of remission were younger, had more severe disease, and 58% indicated that they would be willing to undergo FMT. CONCLUSION: We identified characteristics of UC patients who are more likely to be interested in FMT using preference elicitation methods. Patient-centered care can be enhanced by knowing which patients are more likely to be interested in FMT, potentially improving satisfaction with and adherence to treatments for active UC to maximize the effectiveness of treatment while considering heterogeneity in patient preferences.",2024,,Ther Adv Chronic Dis,15,,20406223241239168,,10.1177/20406223241239168,38544906,#207,Marshall 2024,,,1
Mobile health applications for epilepsy in Indian app stores: A systematic review and content analysis using the mobile app rating scale.,Safeer V S M; Gupta P; Behl S; Bansal D; Sahu JK,"OBJECTIVE: The growing prevalence of smartphones may prompt individuals with epilepsy to pursue unfulfilled healthcare requirements through mobile health (mHealth) apps, but the content and quality of these mHealth apps are rarely analysed. Hence, this study aimed to identify and assess the quality of epilepsy apps for patients with epilepsy (PWE), their caregivers, and healthcare practitioners (HCPs) available in the Play Store and App Store of India. METHODS: We performed a systematic search on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store of India to identify the mHealth apps for epilepsy which were released and updated till May 2023. The identified applications were downloaded and the quality was assessed using a Mobile app rating scale (MARS) for the overall quality, Aesthetics, Engagement, Functionality, and Information by three independent reviewers. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to assess the interrater reliability between the reviewers. An unpaired t-test was calculated to analyse the difference in mean scores for Android and iOS applications. RESULTS: The systematic search yielded a total of 2518 apps, out of which 26 were selected for inclusion in the study. Among these, 9 apps were compatible with Android, 11 with iOS, and 6 on both platforms. The mean (SD) MARS score of the apps was 3.5 (0.6) and the ICC for the overall app quality was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82-0.96). Overall, apps scored highest in functionality (3.9), followed by aesthetics (3.6), information (3.3), and engagement (3.2). Among the included apps, the overall quality score was found to be higher for iOS apps than Android (MD = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.02 - 1.07; p-value: 0.042). CONCLUSION: Our study identified twenty-six mHealth applications for epilepsy that integrated various aspects of epilepsy self-management. The results of this study emphasize the importance of ensuring that current and future applications offer evidence-based information, integrate features that align with patient preferences, and generate evidence regarding the effectiveness of application usage.",2024,Mar,Epilepsy Res,201,,107331,,10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2024.107331,38442549,#277,SafeerVS 2024,,,0
A scoping review on two-stage randomized preference trial in the field of mental health and addiction.,Chen S; Wang W,"BACKGROUND: Randomized Controlled Trial is the most rigorous study design to test the efficacy and effectiveness of an intervention. Patient preference may negatively affect patient performance and decrease the generalizability of a trial to clinical population. Patient preference trial have particular implications in the field of mental health and addiction since mental health interventions are generally complex, blinding of intervention is often difficult or impossible, patients may have strong preference, and outcome measures are often subjective patient self-report which may be greatly influenced if patient's preference did not match with the intervention received. METHODS: In this review, we have surveyed the application of two-stage randomized preference trial with focus on studies in the field of mental health and addiction. The study selection followed the guideline provided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. RESULTS: Six two-stage randomized preference trials (ten publications) have been identified in the field of mental health field and addiction. In these trials, the pooled dropout rates were 18.3% for the preference arm, and 28.7% for the random arm, with a pooled RR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56-0.88; P = 0.010) indicating lower risk of dropout in the preference arm. The standardized preference effects varied widely from 0.07 to 0.57, and could be as large as the treatment effect in some of the trials. CONCLUSION: This scoping review has shown that two-stage randomized preference trials are not as popular as expected in mental health research. The results indicated that two-stage randomized preference trials in mental health would be beneficial in retaining patients to expand the generalizability of the trial.",2023,Mar,BMC Psychiatry,23,1,192,,10.1186/s12888-023-04676-1,36959551,#1403,Chen 2023,,,0
2022 Joint ESC/EACTS review of the 2018 guideline recommendations on the revascularization of left main coronary artery disease in patients at low surgical risk and anatomy suitable for PCI or CABG.,Byrne RA; Fremes S; Capodanno D; Czerny M; Doenst T; Emberson JR; Falk V; Gaudino M; McMurray JJV; Mehran R; Milojevic M; Sousa Uva M,"In October 2021, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) jointly agreed to establish a Task Force (TF) to review recommendations of the 2018 ESC/EACTS Guidelines on myocardial revascularization as they apply to patients with left main (LM) disease with low-to-intermediate SYNTAX score (0-32). This followed the withdrawal of support by the EACTS in 2019 for the recommendations about the management of LM disease of the previous guideline. The TF was asked to review all new relevant data since the 2018 guidelines including updated aggregated data from the four randomized trials comparing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents vs. coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with LM disease. This document represents a summary of the work of the TF; suggested updated recommendations for the choice of revascularization modality in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization for LM disease are included. In stable patients with an indication for revascularization for LM disease, with coronary anatomy suitable for both procedures and a low predicted surgical mortality, the TF concludes that both treatment options are clinically reasonable based on patient preference, available expertise, and local operator volumes. The suggested recommendations for revascularization with CABG are Class I, Level of Evidence A. The recommendations for PCI are Class IIa, Level of Evidence A. The TF recognized several important gaps in knowledge related to revascularization in patients with LM disease and recognizes that aggregated data from the four randomized trials were still only large enough to exclude large differences in mortality.",2023,Nov,Eur Heart J,44,41,4310-4320,,10.1093/eurheartj/ehad476,37632756,#726,Byrne 2023,,,0
First-Trimester Screening Program for the Risk of Pre-eclampsia Using a Multiple-Marker Algorithm: A Health Technology Assessment.,,"BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia is when high blood pressure develops after 20 weeks of pregnancy and either proteinuria, maternal end-organ dysfunction, or uteroplacental dysfunction causing fetal growth restriction also develops. The Fetal Medicine Foundation has created an algorithm (""the FMF algorithm"") that uses maternal factors in combination with biophysical and biochemical markers to identify people at high risk for pre-eclampsia so that they can been offered acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) as a preventive measure. We conducted a health technology assessment to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of a first-trimester population-wide screening program for pre-eclampsia risk that uses the FMF algorithm (""the FMF-based screening program""). We also evaluated the accuracy of the FMF algorithm, the budget impact of publicly funding the population-wide FMF-based screening program, and patient preferences and values. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each study using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions tool and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-Comparative tool, and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature search and conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the FMF-based screening program to standard care (screening for risk of pre-eclampsia using maternal factors alone) from a public payer perspective. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding a population-wide FMF-based screening program in Ontario. We spoke with people who have experience with pregnancy and preeclampsia and their family members through direct interviews to gather preferences and values surrounding pre-eclampsia and the potential screening program. RESULTS: We included nine studies in the clinical evidence review. The FMF-based screening program likely reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia with delivery at less than 37 weeks' gestation compared with standard care, when initiated at 11+(0) to 13+(6) weeks' gestation; risk ratios ranged from 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-0.93) to 0.70 (95% CI 0.58-0.84) (GRADE: Moderate). It may reduce the risks of low birth weight (risk ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.85-0.94]) and low Apgar score (risk ratio 0.73 [95% CI 0.63-0.85]) (GRADE: Low). Evidence on the effectiveness of the FMF-based screening program in reducing the risk of stillbirth and neonatal death was highly uncertain (GRADE: Very low). In addition, the FMF algorithm can improve the detection rate of pre-eclampsia with delivery at less than 37 weeks' gestation or at less than 34 weeks' gestation compared with conventional algorithms, although there are concerns about bias and applicability across studies. The population-wide FMF-based screening program is more effective and more costly than standard care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the population-wide FMF-based screening program compared with standard care is $3,446 per prevented case of pre-eclampsia with delivery at less than 37 weeks. The annual budget impact of publicly funding the population-wide FMF-based screening program in Ontario ranges from an additional $1.23 million in year 1 to $3.56 million in year 5, for a total of $8.50 million over the next 5 years. The population-wide FMF-based screening program was seen as valuable by those who have experienced pregnancy and their family members. Strong emphasis was placed on providing education and equitable access as part of any screening program, and participants valued the potential clinical benefits that the population-wide FMF-based screening program could provide. CONCLUSIONS: The FMF-based screening program is likely more effective than standard care in reducing the risk of pre-eclampsia with delivery at less than 37 weeks' gestation. Also, the FMF algorithm can improve the detection rate of pre-eclampsia with delivery at less than 37 weeks' gestation or at less than 34 weeks' gestation when compared with conventional algorithms. The population-wide FMF-based screening program is more effective and more costly than standard care. We estimate that publicly funding the population-wide FMF-based screening program in Ontario would result in additional costs of $8.50 million over the next 5 years. Pregnant people and their family members valued the potential equitable access, information, and clinical benefits that the population-wide FMF-based screening program could provide.",2023,,Ont Health Technol Assess Ser,22,5,1-118,,,37772268,#1611,,,,0
Building an implementation framework to address unmet contraceptive care needs in a carceral setting: a systematic review.,Routh D; Simmons R; Sanders J; Gero A; Tanner HA; Turok DK,"BACKGROUND: The provision of contraceptive care for incarcerated individuals has been largely inconsistent and has contributed to, at best, inadequate care, and at worst reproductive abuses, violence, and coercion. While previous research has identified strategies to remedy known issues, to date, very few recommendations have been implemented across the carceral system. To address this, we conducted a systematic review of policy and practice recommendations to improve contraceptive care to reproductive-aged, incarcerated individuals in the United States. METHODS: We conducted this systematic review utilizing the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and framed it within the National Implementation Research Network's (NIRN) Exploration stage. We searched PubMed, PSYCInfo, SCOPUS, ProQuest, Web of Science, MedLine, Social Science Citation Index and reference sections of included materials. Basic study information, explicitly stated policy and practice recommendations, and discussions and conclusions that subtly provide recommendations were extracted in full text. We utilized a thematic analysis approach to analyze the extracted text. RESULTS: A total of 45 materials met the inclusion criteria. Seven overarching themes were identified: 1) policy changes needed to implement care; 2) need for contraceptive care in carceral systems; 3) justice agency barriers regarding contraceptive care provision; 4) policy barriers to contraceptive access; 5) funding strategies to improve care; 6) patient preferences for contraceptive care delivery; and 7) healthcare provider knowledge regarding contraceptive care. The seven themes identified shed light on the need for, gaps, barriers, and facilitators of current contraceptive care provision to incarcerated individuals. CONCLUSION: This systematic review accomplished two goals of NIRN's Exploration stage. First, the compiled evidence identified a clear need for change regarding policies and practices pertaining to contraceptive care provision to incarcerated individuals in the United States. Second, our findings identified several evidence-based solutions supported both by research and professional healthcare organizations to address the identified need for change. This study provides an initial blueprint for correctional agencies to implement the necessary changes for improving contraceptive care provision to incarcerated populations. The correctional system is in a unique position to deliver much-needed care, which would result in many potential benefits to the individuals, correctional system, and community at large.",2023,Oct,Health Justice,11,1,43,,10.1186/s40352-023-00243-8,37861888,#770,Routh 2023,,,0
Use of Patient Preferences Data Regarding Multiple Risks to Inform Regulatory Decisions.,Montano-Campos JF; Gonzalez JM; Rickert T; Fairchild AO; Levitan B; Reed SD,"Background and Objectives. Risk-tolerance measures from patient-preference studies typically focus on individual adverse events. We recently introduced an approach that extends maximum acceptable risk (MAR) calculations to simultaneous maximum acceptable risk thresholds (SMART) for multiple treatment-related risks. We extend these methods to include the computation and display of confidence intervals and apply the approach to 3 published discrete-choice experiments to evaluate its utility to inform regulatory decisions. Methods. We generate MAR estimates and SMART curves and compare them with trial-based benefit-risk profiles of select treatments for depression, psoriasis, and thyroid cancer. Results. In the depression study, SMART curves with 70% to 95% confidence intervals portray which combinations of 2 adverse events would be considered acceptable. In the psoriasis example, the asymmetric confidence intervals for the SMART curve indicate that relying on independent MARs versus SMART curves when there are nonlinear preferences can lead to decisions that could expose patients to greater risks than they would accept. The thyroid cancer application shows an example in which the clinical incidence of each of 3 adverse events is lower than the single-event MARs for the expected treatment benefit, yet the collective risk profile surpasses acceptable levels when considered jointly. Limitations. Nonrandom sample of studies. Conclusions. When evaluating conventional MARs in which the observed incidences are near the estimated MARs or where preferences demonstrate diminishing marginal disutility of risk, conventional MAR estimates will overstate risk acceptance, which could lead to misinformed decisions, potentially placing patients at greater risk of adverse events than they would accept. Implications. The SMART method, herein extended to include confidence intervals, provides a reproducible, transparent evidence-based approach to enable decision makers to use data from discrete-choice experiments to account for multiple adverse events. HIGHLIGHTS: Estimates of maximum acceptable risk (MAR) for a defined treatment benefit can be useful to inform regulatory decisions; however, the conventional metric considers one adverse event at a time.This article applies a new approach known as SMART (simultaneous maximum acceptable risk thresholds) that accounts for multiple adverse events to 3 published discrete-choice experiments.Findings reveal that conventional MARs could lead decision makers to accept a treatment based on individual risks that would not be acceptable if multiple risks are considered simultaneously.",2023,Jan-Jun,MDM Policy Pract,8,1,23814683221148715,,10.1177/23814683221148715,36654678,#1592,Montano-Campos 2023,,,1
Accentuating patient values in shared decision-making: A mixed methods development of an online value clarification tool and communication training in the context of early phase clinical cancer trials.,van Gurp JLP; van Lent LGG; Stoel N; van der Rijt CCD; van Weert JCM; Hasselaar J,"OBJECTIVE: In the shared decision-making (SDM) process for potential early phase clinical cancer trial participation, value clarification is highly recommended. However, exploration and discussion of patient values between patients and oncologists remains limited. This study aims to develop an SDM-supportive intervention, consisting of a preparatory online value clarification tool (OnVaCT) and a communication training. METHODS: The OnVaCT intervention was developed and pilot-tested by combining theoretical notions on value clarification, with interview studies with patients and oncologists, focus groups with patient representatives and oncologists, and think aloud sessions with patients, following the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for complex interventions. These human-centered methodologies enabled a user-centered approach at every step of the development process of the intervention. RESULTS: This study shows relevant patient values and oncologists' perspectives on value exploration and discussion in daily practice.

Patient and Healthcare Professional Preferences for Prescription Weight Loss Medications in Australia: Two Discrete Choice Experiments.,Fifer S; Keen B; Porter A,"PURPOSE: Overweight and obesity are common in Australia and among the leading risk factors for ill health. Maintained weight loss of >5-10% can prevent and reduce the risk of obesity-related comorbidities. Prescription weight loss medications plus lifestyle interventions can result in additional weight loss compared with lifestyle interventions alone, but these medications are under-prescribed in Australia. Our aim was to develop a greater understanding of the treatment preferences of people with overweight or obesity and the healthcare practitioners (HCPs) who treat them. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: An online survey of Australian adults with overweight or obesity and treating HCPs was conducted in 2020. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) approach was used to determine what is most important to people when evaluating oral and injectable prescription weight loss medications. Participants were asked to choose between three hypothetical treatment alternatives: ""Oral pill""; ""Subcutaneous injection pen (replaceable needle)""; ""Disposable subcutaneous injection pen (hidden needle)""; and an opt-out option (""None of these""). RESULTS: The online survey and DCE were completed by 193 patients and 104 HCPs. For both patients and HCPs, all treatment alternatives (oral, replaceable injection and disposable injection) were preferred over the opt-out. Gastrointestinal side effects, followed by success rate, percentage body weight lost, and cost were the most important attributes to patients. For HCPs, percentage body weight loss was the most important treatment attribute, followed by success rate, gastrointestinal side effects and cost. While most patients reported relatively low needle fear, physicians reported relatively high perceived patient needle fear. CONCLUSION: Clinician-patient discussions about treatments for weight loss should cover the option of prescription weight loss medications, including injectable medications, which patients may be less apprehensive about than physicians believe. Treatments with a high success rate and low or manageable risk of gastrointestinal side effects may be preferred over alternatives.",2024,,Patient Prefer Adherence,18,,435-454,,10.2147/PPA.S446106,38406377,#357,Fifer 2024,,,1
Lessons from immunotherapies in multiple sclerosis.,Rispoli MG; D'Apolito M; Pozzilli V; Tomassini V,"The improved understanding of multiple sclerosis (MS) neurobiology alongside the development of novel markers of disease will allow precision medicine to be applied to MS patients, bringing the promise of improved care. Combinations of clinical and paraclinical data are currently used for diagnosis and prognosis. The addition of advanced magnetic resonance imaging and biofluid markers has been strongly encouraged, since classifying patients according to the underlying biology will improve monitoring and treatment strategies. For example, silent progression seems to contribute significantly more than relapses to overall disability accumulation, but currently approved treatments for MS act mainly on neuroinflammation and offer only a partial protection against neurodegeneration. Further research, involving traditional and adaptive trial designs, should strive to halt, repair or protect against central nervous system damage. To personalize new treatments, their selectivity, tolerability, ease of administration, and safety must be considered, while to personalize treatment approaches, patient preferences, risk-aversion, and lifestyle must be factored in, and patient feedback used to indicate real-world treatment efficacy. The use of biosensors and machine-learning approaches to integrate biological, anatomical, and physiological parameters will take personalized medicine a step closer toward the patient's virtual twin, in which treatments can be tried before they are applied.",2023,,Handb Clin Neurol,193,,293-311,,10.1016/B978-0-323-85555-6.00013-8,36803817,#1619,Rispoli 2023,,,0
Moral justification for the use of 'add-ons' in assisted reproductive technology: experts' views and experiences.,Gallagher S; Kerridge I; Newson A; Attinger S; Norman RJ; Lipworth W,"RESEARCH QUESTION: What factors do assisted reproductive terchnology (ART) providers take into account when they make decisions about offering 'add-ons'? DESIGN: A qualitative analysis of interviews with 31 ART professionals, focusing on their views and experiences in relation to add-ons, including the factors that are considered when doctors make decisions about their use. RESULTS: The participants reported that a range of considerations are taken into account when it comes to justifying the use of a particular add-on in a given circumstance, including the likelihood of benefit and harm, patients' perceived psychological needs and preferences, and organizational expectations. Importantly, patient preferences, psychological factors and low risk of harm appear to be stronger motivations than increasing the likelihood of a live birth or the desire to innovate. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that it cannot be taken for granted that add-ons and innovation are closely linked. One possible response to this would be regulatory reform; for example, only allowing 'unproven' add-ons to be used in the context of formal scientific evaluation. Alternatively, it could be made clear that add-ons that are not undergoing formal evaluation have more in common with other therapies lacking a clear evidence base, such as complementary and alternative medicines, than with conventional medical practice. Practices in relation to add-ons may also require a focus on the responsibilities of corporations, and the standards applying to purveyors of consumer goods and services.",2024,Feb,Reprod Biomed Online,48,2,103637,,10.1016/j.rbmo.2023.103637,38185024,#413,Gallagher 2024,,,0
Determinants of Clinical Decision Making under Uncertainty in Dentistry: A Scoping Review.,Murdoch AIK; Blum J; Chen J; Baziotis-Kalfas D; Dao A; Bai K; Bekheet M; Atwal N; Cho SSH; Ganhewa M; Cirillo N,"Clinical decision-making for diagnosing and treating oral and dental diseases consolidates multiple sources of complex information, yet individual clinical judgements are often made intuitively on limited heuristics to simplify decision making, which may lead to errors harmful to patients. This study aimed at systematically evaluating dental practitioners' clinical decision-making processes during diagnosis and treatment planning under uncertainty. A scoping review was chosen as the optimal study design due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the topic. Key terms and a search strategy were defined, and the articles published in the repository of the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE/PubMed) were searched, selected, and analysed in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Of the 478 studies returned, 64 relevant articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. Studies that were included were based in 27 countries, with the majority from the UK and USA. Articles were dated from 1991 to 2022, with all being observational studies except four, which were experimental studies. Six major recurring themes were identified: clinical factors, clinical experience, patient preferences and perceptions, heuristics and biases, artificial intelligence and informatics, and existing guidelines. These results suggest that inconsistency in treatment recommendations is a real possibility and despite great advancements in dental science, evidence-based practice is but one of a multitude of complex determinants driving clinical decision making in dentistry. In conclusion, clinical decisions, particularly those made individually by a dental practitioner, are potentially prone to sub-optimal treatment and poorer patient outcomes.",2023,Mar,Diagnostics (Basel),13,6,,,10.3390/diagnostics13061076,36980383,#1413,MurdochAIK 2023,,,0
Telemedicine Satisfaction and Preferences in an Orthopaedic Spine Clinic.,Holbert SE; Brennan J; Turcotte J; Patton C,"The use of telemedicine has expanded amid the COVID-19 pandemic and office closures and cancellation of elective surgeries early in the pandemic helped propagated its use. Previous studies have described the feasibility of telemedicine, however, little has been reported on patient perception and preferences within orthopaedics. The objective of this study was to evaluate satisfaction and preferences of telemedicine from the perspective of patients within an orthopaedic spine clinic. A cross-sectional, anonymous survey was implemented as a prospective quality improvement initiative. The survey was sent to patients who had an in-office or telemedicine visit with a provider in our orthopaedic spine clinic. Statistical analysis was performed on the results of the survey. The survey was sent to 1129 patients and a total of 316 patients responded. Twenty-one percent of respondents had a telemedicine appointment. There was no difference in satisfaction among groups (P = .288) and those with telemedicine appointments were more likely to have had a previous experience with this type of visit (P = .004) and were more inclined to use it in the future (P < .001). Patients preferred telemedicine because of the ability to get earlier appointments (P < .001) and the convenience of the visits (P < .001). Patients preferred in-office visits because they received hands-on physical exams (P = .003) or imaging (P = .041). Telemedicine is a viable alternative to in-office appointments for spine patients, as evidenced by similar levels of patient satisfaction. Sooner appointments and convenience are attractive elements of telemedicine visits, while the desire for physical examination remains a barrier to adoption in this population.",2023,Aug,Surg Innov,30,4,463-470,,10.1177/15533506221140477,36426904,#1029,Holbert 2023,,,0
Factors that shape recurrent miscarriage care experiences: findings from a national survey.,Flannery C; Hennessy M; Dennehy R; Matvienko-Sikar K; Lucey C; Dhubhgain JU; O'Donoghue K,"BACKGROUND: Learning what matters to women/couples with recurrent miscarriage (RM) is essential to inform service improvement efforts and future RM care practices. Previous national and international surveys have examined inpatient stays, maternity care, and care experiences around pregnancy loss, but there is little focus on RM care. We aimed to explore the experiences of women and men who have received RM care and identify patient-centred care items linked to overall RM care experience. METHODS: Between September and November 2021, we invited people who had experienced two or more consecutive first trimester miscarriages and received care for RM in Ireland in the ten-year period prior to participate in a cross-sectional web-based national survey. The survey was purposefully designed and administered via Qualtrics. It included questions on sociodemographics, pregnancy and pregnancy loss history, investigation and treatment for RM, overall RM care experience, and patient-centred care items at various stages of the RM care pathway such as respect for patients' preferences, information and support, the environment, and involvement of partners/family. We analysed data using Stata. RESULTS: We included 139 participants (97% women, n = 135) in our analysis. Of the 135 women, 79% were aged 35-44 years (n = 106), 24% rated their overall RM care experience as poor (n = 32), 36% said the care they received was much worse than expected (n = 48), and 60% stated health care professionals in different places did not work well together (n = 81). Women were more likely to rate a good care experience if they had a healthcare professional to talk to about their worries/fears for RM investigations (RRR 6.11 [95% CI: 1.41-26.41]), received a treatment plan (n = 70) (RRR 3.71 [95% CI: 1.28-10.71]), and received answers they could understand in a subsequent pregnancy (n = 97) (RRR 8 [95% CI: 0.95-67.13]). CONCLUSIONS: While overall experience of RM care was poor, we identified areas that could potentially improve people's RM care experiences - which have international relevance - such as information provision, supportive care, communication between healthcare professionals and people with RM, and care coordination between healthcare professionals across care settings.",2023,Mar,BMC Health Serv Res,23,1,317,,10.1186/s12913-023-09347-1,36997901,#1392,Flannery 2023,,,0
Emerging space for non-polyethene-glycol bowel preparations in inflammatory bowel disease-related colonoscopy: Veering toward better adherence and palatability.,Pellegrino R; Gravina AG,"Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) require repeated endoscopic evaluations over time by colonoscopy to weigh disease activity but also for different and additional indications (e.g., evaluation of postoperative recurrence, colorectal cancer surveillance). Colonoscopy, however, requires adequate bowel preparation to be of quality. The latter is achieved as long as the patient takes a certain amount of product to have a number of bowel movements suitable to clean the colon and allow optimal visualization of the mucosa during endoscopy. However, significant guidelines recommend preparations for patients with IBD not excelling in palatability. This recommendation originates from the fact that most of the studies conducted on bowel preparations in patients with IBD have been done with isosmolar preparations based on polyethylene glycol (PEG), for which, therefore, more safety data exist. As a result, the low-volume non-PEG preparations (e.g., magnesium citrate plus picosulphate, oral sulphate solutions) have been set aside for the whole range of warnings to be heeded because of their hyperosmolarity. New studies, however, are emerging, leaning in overall for a paradigm shift in this matter. Indeed, such non-PEG preparations seem to show a particularly encouraging and engaging safety profile when considering their broad potential for tolerability and patient preference. Indeed, such evidence is insufficient to indicate such preparations in all patients with IBD but may pave the way for those with remission or well-controlled disease. This article summarizes the central studies conducted in IBD settings using non-PEG preparations by discussing their results.",2023,Dec,World J Gastroenterol,29,46,6022-6027,,10.3748/wjg.v29.i46.6022,38130742,#564,Pellegrino 2023,,,0
Tretinoin 0.1% and Benzoyl Peroxide 3% Cream for the Treatment of Facial Acne Vulgaris.,Kontzias C; Zaino M; Feldman SR,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, safety, and clinical application of tretinoin 0.1%-benzoyl peroxide 3% cream for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of the literature was performed using the terms Twyneo OR tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide OR S6G5T-3 in MEDLINE (PubMed) and EMBASE. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to obtain completed clinical trial results not published elsewhere. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All human studies published in English prior to November 2022 related to pharmacology, clinical trials, safety, and efficacy were evaluated for inclusion. DATA SYNTHESIS: In two 12-week, phase 3, randomized, vehicle-controlled clinical trials, tretinoin 0.1%-benzoyl peroxide 3% cream significantly reduced inflammatory and noninflammatory facial acne lesions and significantly improved Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) rating to clear or almost clear. The cream has a suitable safety profile, with application site pain and dryness as the most common adverse events. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE IN COMPARISON TO EXISTING AGENTS: Tretinoin-BPO had similar IGA success compared to other topical retinoid and retinoid-BPO treatments for acne vulgaris. Compared to individual tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide therapy, the combination product streamlines application, which will improve medication adherence; however, the cost of tretinoin-BPO cream may be prohibitive.

Cost-Utility Analysis of the Port Delivery System with Ranibizumab for Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,Brown GC; Brown MM; Monigle MC,"PURPOSE: To quantify the cost-utility ratio of the ranibizumab Port Delivery System (PDS; SUSVIMO) versus intravitreal ranibizumab injections for treating neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) based upon Archway Phase 3 Trial data. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. SUBJECTS: Archway Phase 3 Clinical Trial nAMD participants previously responsive to anti-VEGF therapy were randomized 3:2. Two hundred forty received PDS refills q 24 weeks and 162 received ranibizumab injections. METHODS: Ophthalmic patient, time tradeoff utilities, direct medical and societal cost perspectives, 12-year, 1-year, and 5-year timelines, United States 2022 real dollars, and a 3% annual discount rate were employed. Utilities were adjusted for nAMD conversion in fellow eyes during the 12-year, mean participant life expectancy. Premature death associated with severe vision loss was integrated as per the population-based Salisbury Eye Evaluation Study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) accruals, costs, and incremental and average cost-utility ratios in $/QALY (dollars expended per QALY gained). RESULTS: Versus no therapy, the 1-year PDS QALY gain was 0.0156 (6.8%) versus 0.0063 (0.82%) for intravitreal injections (P < 0.001), whereas the respective 12-year QALY gains were 1.714 (28%) and 1.639 (26.8%) (P = 0.99). One-year direct PDS ophthalmic costs totaled $21 825 with 2 ranibizumab fills, whereas ranibizumab injection therapy totaled $18 405 with 11.8 injections. The 1-year incremental PDS $/QALY versus injections was cost effective at $75 497/QALY. Five-year PDS therapy was not incrementally cost effective at $304 108/QALY, nor was the 12-year therapy at $761 646/QALY. Average 12-year cost-utility ratios were $78 773/QALY for the PDS and $47 917/QALY for injection therapy. Adding -$476 442 12-year offsetting societal costs netted $314 521 to society per PDS participant versus $370 958 per participant for injection therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ranibizumab PDS therapy was not incrementally cost effective versus ranibizumab injection therapy at 12 or 5 years but was at 1 year. Injection therapy had a more favorable 12-year average cost-utility ratio. Vision gain was the major determinant of participant value gain and was the same for both interventions. Both interventions were highly cost effective utilizing average cost-utility analysis with the societal cost perspective.

Merging machine learning and patient preference: a novel tool for risk prediction of percutaneous coronary interventions.,Hamilton DE; Albright J; Seth M; Painter I; Maynard C; Hira RS; Sukul D; Gurm HS,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Predicting personalized risk for adverse events following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains critical in weighing treatment options, employing risk mitigation strategies, and enhancing shared decision-making. This study aimed to employ machine learning models using pre-procedural variables to accurately predict common post-PCI complications. METHODS: A group of 66 adults underwent a semiquantitative survey assessing a preferred list of outcomes and model display. The machine learning cohort included 107 793 patients undergoing PCI procedures performed at 48 hospitals in Michigan between 1 April 2018 and 31 December 2021 in the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Cardiovascular Consortium (BMC2) registry separated into training and validation cohorts. External validation was conducted in the Cardiac Care Outcomes Assessment Program database of 56 583 procedures in 33 hospitals in Washington. RESULTS: Overall rate of in-hospital mortality was 1.85% (n = 1999), acute kidney injury 2.51% (n = 2519), new-onset dialysis 0.44% (n = 462), stroke 0.41% (n = 447), major bleeding 0.89% (n = 942), and transfusion 2.41% (n = 2592). The model demonstrated robust discrimination and calibration for mortality {area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.930 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.920-0.940]}, acute kidney injury [AUC: 0.893 (95% CI 0.883-0.903)], dialysis [AUC: 0.951 (95% CI 0.939-0.964)], stroke [AUC: 0.751 (95%CI 0.714-0.787)], transfusion [AUC: 0.917 (95% CI 0.907-0.925)], and major bleeding [AUC: 0.887 (95% CI 0.870-0.905)]. Similar discrimination was noted in the external validation population. Survey subjects preferred a comprehensive list of individually reported post-procedure outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Using common pre-procedural risk factors, the BMC2 machine learning models accurately predict post-PCI outcomes. Utilizing patient feedback, the BMC2 models employ a patient-centred tool to clearly display risks to patients and providers (https://shiny.bmc2.org/pci-prediction/). Enhanced risk prediction prior to PCI could help inform treatment selection and shared decision-making discussions.",2024,Feb,Eur Heart J,45,8,601-609,,10.1093/eurheartj/ehad836,38233027,#355,Hamilton 2024,,,0

"Shared Decision-Making in the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis: Results of a Cross-Sectional, Real-World Survey in Europe and the United States.",Keenan A; Le HH; Gandhi K; Adedokun L; Jones E; Unsworth M; Pike J; Trenholm E,"INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive deterioration of cognitive and physical functioning, reducing activities of daily living and quality of life (QoL). Several treatments are available that modify the course of the disease and reduce the frequency of relapses. Although effective, all treatment options are accompanied by adverse events, and this study aimed to assess the extent to which patients were involved in the choice of treatment. METHODS: Data were drawn from the Adelphi Multiple Sclerosis Disease Specific Program (DSP)™, a cross-sectional survey of healthcare practitioners (HCP) and their patients with MS in real-world clinical settings in Europe and the United States (US) between December 2020 and July 2021. HCPs reported patient demographics, clinical characteristics, current and previous treatment, and treatment outcomes. Patients voluntarily completed questionnaires reporting the physical and psychological impact of their MS and its treatment. Regression analysis with inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to compare treatment outcomes in patients actively involved in their current treatment choice with those who were not. RESULTS: Of a total of 692 patients, median age 40 years and 64% female, mostly diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS, those who were involved in shared decision-making tended to choose oral therapies such as dimethyl fumarate more often than HCPs. MS had greater impact on physical and psychological functioning in patients whose HCP made treatment decisions solely. Patients involved in decision-making reported greater satisfaction with their treatment and a better QoL. DISCUSSION: Because no single optimal therapy exists for patients with MS, treatments should be individualized with consideration of patients' preferences. Our study shows that shared decision-making is under-utilized in the management of MS and supports the benefits of patient involvement. CONCLUSION: Patients who have an active role in treatment decision-making show improved wellbeing and QoL, and overall treatment satisfaction.",2024,,Patient Prefer Adherence,18,,137-149,,10.2147/PPA.S440410,38249686,#469,Keenan 2024,,,0
Mapping the experiences of people with advanced cancer across multiple cancer types-a scoping review.,Kalloger SE; Ho C; Mitton C; Regier DA,"BACKGROUND: Through the introduction of tumor agnostic therapies, people with metastatic cancer and their treating physicians are facing new treatment choices that have differing side effect and efficacy profiles from conventional chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: The present study undertakes a scoping review of research into the experiences of people with advanced or metastatic cancer across various solid tumor types with the goal of developing a tumor-agnostic conceptual model. DESIGN: Automated queries on three internet search engines were performed to identify qualitative interview studies that focused on people with metastatic cancer. No limits were imposed for dates nor location of studies. RESULTS: Of the 173 hits generated from the searches, 25 peer-reviewed papers were selected for the review with dates that ranged from 2007 to 2022. All papers originated from the USA, Europe, Australia, or Japan. Three major themes emerged that formed the basis for the tumor-agnostic conceptual model: symptoms, loss of autonomy, and adaptation/coping. CONCLUSIONS: The explication of the interplay between the physical and emotional symptoms experienced by those with advanced and metastatic cancer using a multi-tumor approach provides the potential to make generalizations about the needs of this population. An opportunity exists to potentially address these needs through matching patient needs and preferences with the characteristics of novel therapeutics.

Editorial Commentary: Surgical Videos on YouTube Are Not Peer Reviewed and Have Low Educational Value.,Perry NM; Kelly JJ; Levy BA,"The rise of online platforms like YouTube for health information has prompted scrutiny over the quality of medical/surgical-related video content. Recent research on YouTube videos regarding anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with quadriceps tendon autograft shows low educational quality and reliability using established assessment tools. Physicians primarily published content, with longer videos, and physician-generated videos, generally correlating with higher quality. However, YouTube's inadequacy as a reliable source for ACLR information underscores the need for alternative educational resources. Orthopaedic health care professionals must play a pivotal role in guiding patients toward credible sources and take aim at improving online content quality.

Toenail Onychomycosis with or without Diabetes in Canada: Patient Treatment Preferences and Health State Utilities.,Mickle AT; Lozano-Ortega G; Gaudet V; Popoff E; Barbeau M; Mathieu S,"BACKGROUND: Toenail onychomycosis affects approximately 6.7% of Canadians. Symptoms include nail discolouration/disfiguration and pain; psychosocial impacts contribute to reduced health-related quality-of-life. Comorbid diabetes increases the risk of complications and exacerbates burden. Treatment may include topical therapy and/or oral agents. PURPOSE: To understand toenail onychomycosis treatment preferences, and to quantify the impact of toenail onychomycosis, with or without diabetes, on patient well-being. METHODS: Adults living in Canada with self-reported, physician-diagnosed, toenail onychomycosis were recruited online. A discrete choice experiment was used to quantify treatment preferences. Scenarios were randomized; data were analyzed using conditional logit regression. Health state utilities were estimated using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3(®). Results were stratified by diabetes status and toenail onychomycosis severity; the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to assess between-group utility differences. RESULTS: Three-hundred thirteen participants with toenail onychomycosis were included (161 had comorbid diabetes; 61.3%, severe onychomycosis). The mean age was 57.7 years; 55.9% were male. Treatment attributes with statistically significant impacts on patient preferences were efficacy (odds ratio [OR],1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.05 per 1% increased treatment success), administration method (one pill versus topical nail lacquer reference, 1.14; 1.04-1.26; topical solution applicator versus reference: 1.15; 1.03-1.29), severe adverse events (0.85; 0.80-0.90 per 1% increased risk), and risk of potential pharmacodynamic (0.80; 0.76-0.85) and alcohol (0.93; 0.88-0.98) interactions; preferences were more pronounced for efficacy and avoiding severe adverse events among toenail onychomycosis patients with comorbid diabetes. The mean (95% CI) utility value was 0.73 (0.70-0.75) overall, and statistically significantly lower (p=0.02) for toenail onychomycosis patients with diabetes (0.70; CI, 0.66-0.73) than those without (0.76; CI, 0.72-0.79). CONCLUSION: Among patients with toenail onychomycosis, the presence of diabetes was associated with differing treatment-related preferences. Utility values for patients with toenail onychomycosis represent a significant decline from full health that is exacerbated by comorbid diabetes.",2024,,Patient Prefer Adherence,18,,475-486,,10.2147/PPA.S450215,38410773,#349,Mickle 2024,,,1
Telemedicine Implementation for Safety Net Populations: A Systematic Review.,Tierney AA; Mosqueda M; Cesena G; Frehn JL; Payán DD; Rodriguez HP,"Background: Telemedicine systems were rapidly implemented in response to COVID-19. However, little is known about their effectiveness, acceptability, and sustainability for safety net populations. This study systematically reviewed primary care telemedicine implementation and effectiveness in safety net settings. Methods: We searched PubMed for peer-reviewed articles on telemedicine implementation from 2013 to 2021. The search was done between June and December 2021. Included articles focused on health care organizations that primarily serve low-income and/or rural populations in the United States. We screened 244 articles from an initial search of 343 articles and extracted and analyzed data from N = 45 articles. Results: Nine (20%) of 45 articles were randomized controlled trials. N = 22 reported findings for at least one marginalized group (i.e., racial/ethnic minority, 65 years+, limited English proficiency). Only n = 19 (42%) included African American/Black patients in demographics descriptions, n = 14 (31%) LatinX/Hispanic patients, n = 4 (9%) Asian patients, n = 4 (9%) patients aged 65+ years, and n = 4 (9%) patients with limited English proficiency. Results show telemedicine can provide high-quality primary care that is more accessible and affordable. Fifteen studies assessed barriers and facilitators to telemedicine implementation. Common barriers were billing/administrative workflow disruption (n = 9, 20%), broadband access/quality (n = 5, 11%), and patient preference for in-person care (n = 4, 9%). Facilitators included efficiency gains (n = 6, 13%), patient acceptance (n = 3, 7%), and enhanced access (n = 3, 7%).

Advancing precision oncology through systematic germline and tumor genetic analysis: The oncogenetic point of view on findings from a prospective multicenter clinical trial of 666 patients.,Mazel B; Bertolone G; Baurand A; Cosset E; Sawka C; Robert M; Gautier E; Lançon A; Réda M; Favier L; Dérangère V; Richard C; Binquet C; Boidot R; Goussot V; Albuisson J; Ghiringhelli F; Faivre L; Nambot S,"INTRODUCTION: With the emergence of targeted therapies, there is a need to accurately identify more tumor biomarkers. The EXOMA trial was designed to offer tumor and germline exome sequencing (ES) to patients with solid malignant tumors and facing therapeutic failure. As hereditary cancer predispositions could be identified, with genetic counseling and health management implications, a genetic consultation was systematically established. This design needs to be discussed as genetic human resources are limited and indication of theranostic tests will increase. METHODS: Genetic counseling was conducted within 15 days following inclusion in the study for patients recruited between December 2015 and July 2019. In silico analyses from theranostic ES were limited to 317 genes involved in oncogenesis, from both tumor and blood DNA. RESULTS: Six hundred and sixty six patients had a genetic consultation before ES. In 65/666 patients, 66 germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants were identified in 16 actionable genes and seven non-actionable genes according to French guidelines. 24/65 patients had previously received genetic analysis for diagnostic purposes, and for 17 of them, a P/LP variant had already been identified. Among the 48/65 remaining cases for which the EXOMA protocol revealed a previously unknown P/LP variant, only 19 met the criteria for genetic testing for inherited cancer risk after familial survey. These criteria had not been identified by the oncologist in 10 cases. In 21/65 cases, the variant was considered incidental. DISCUSSION: In 7.4% of patients, an undiagnosed hereditary genetic predisposition was identified, whether or not related to the clinical presentation, and germline analysis impacted oncological management for only 6.3% of the cohort. This low percentage should be weighed against the burden of systematic genetic consultation and urgent circuits. Information or training tools to form oncologists to the prescription of germline genetic analyses should be explored, as well as information supports and patient preferences.",2023,Sep,Cancer Med,12,18,18786-18796,,10.1002/cam4.6498,37694493,#897,Mazel 2023,,,0
Patients' preferences for chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment: The CHOICE study.,Sportoletti P; Laurenti L; Chiarenza A; Gaidano G; Albi E; Mauro FR; Trentin L; Vallisa D; Pane F; Cuneo A; Albano F; Zamprogna G; Coscia M; Gozzetti A; Reda G; Caira M; Finsinger P; Gualberti G; Iannella E; Malgieri S; Molica S,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) therapies differ in efficacy, side effects, route, frequency, and duration of administration. We assessed patient preferences for treatment attributes and evaluated associations with disease stage, treatment line, and socio-demographic characteristics in a cross sectional, observational study conducted at 16 Italian hematology centers. Study visits occurred between February and July 2020; 401 adult patients with CLL (201 Watch and Wait (W&W), 200 treated) participated in a discrete choice experiment (DCE), composed of 8 choices between pairs of treatment profiles with different levels of 5 attributes of currently available CLL treatments (length of response, route and duration of administration, risk of side effects including diarrhea, infections, or organ damage). Health-related quality of life was assessed with the EQ-5D-5L, EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ CLL-16. Previously treated patients had longer disease duration (7 vs. 5 years), higher prevalence of serious comorbidities (45.5% vs. 36.2%) and high-risk molecular markers (unmutated IGHV 55.6% vs. 17.1%; TP53 mutation 15.2% vs. 4.0%). Health-related quality of life scores were similar between groups. In the DCE, W&W patients rated ""possible occurrence of infections"" highest (relative importance [RI] = 36.2%), followed by ""treatment and relevant duration"" (RI = 28.0%) and ""progression-free survival (PFS)"" (RI = 16.9%). Previously treated patients rated ""treatment and relevant duration"" highest (RI = 33.3%), followed by ""possible occurrence of infections"" (RI = 28.8%), ""possible occurrence of organ damage"" (RI = 19.4%), and ""PFS"" (RI = 9.8%). Concern over infection was rated highest overall; unexpectedly PFS was not among the most important criteria in either group, suggesting that the first COVID-19 pandemic wave may have influenced patient preferences and concerns about CLL therapy options.",2024,Jan,Hematol Oncol,42,1,e3216,,10.1002/hon.3216,37772620,#524,Sportoletti 2024,,,1
Cutaneous Sarcoidosis.,Abdelghaffar M; Hwang E; Damsky W,"Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease that most commonly affects the lungs, lymphatic system, eyes, and skin but any organ may be involved.

Development and validation of a psoriasis treatment acceptability measure through group concept mapping.,Hudgens S; Howerter A; Keith S; Evans C; Pelletier C,"BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a common autoimmune dermatologic condition which has a pronounced negative impact on patient quality of life and disease burden. Currently, there are a number of treatments available for psoriasis, with differences in efficacy, mechanism of action, mode of administration, adverse effects, and tolerability. However, a reliable, validated patient-reported instrument to address patient expectations and of psoriasis treatment has not been developed. This project was undertaken with the aim of developing a fit-for-purpose self-reported instrument to inform patient expectations and preferences of psoriasis treatments. METHODS: Two studies, both utilizing qualitative and quantitative methods, were conducted in patients within the entire spectrum of psoriasis severity. In Study 1, a group concept mapping (GCM) exercise was conducted with dermatologists and moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients to identify concepts important in the treatment of psoriasis. In Study 2, a preliminary Treatment Acceptability Questionnaire (TAQ) was developed using GCM-derived concepts from Studies 1 and 2, followed by cognitive debriefing (CD) telephone interviews of the preliminary TAQ. In Study 2, another GCM exercise was conducted with mild and newly diagnosed psoriasis patients. Psychometric analyses were performed on the TAQ to evaluate validity and reliability. RESULTS: The Study 1 GCM exercise generated 43 concepts from moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients (n = 20) and dermatologists (n = 10). In Study 2, 37 GCM concepts were generated from mild and newly diagnosed psoriasis patients (n = 20). From the 2 GCM exercises, 28 concepts were selected to form the preliminary TAQ; CD interviews indicated strong understanding and relevance of TAQ items among patients with disease ranging from mild to severe. The final TAQ consisted of 20 items; psychometric analysis demonstrated strong validity and reliability of the TAQ. CONCLUSIONS: The TAQ is a novel psychometrically validated patient-reported instrument to inform healthcare providers of patients' expectations of and preferences for treatment of their psoriasis and can help in shared decision making between patients and physicians.",2023,Aug,Health Qual Life Outcomes,21,1,83,,10.1186/s12955-023-02162-6,37553594,#985,Hudgens 2023,,,1
Experiences Navigating the Pregnancy Care Continuum During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,Jaffe EF; Spach NC; Sullivan KA; Lyerly AD; Goldfarb IT,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented changes in care delivery across the pregnancy care continuum. Our primary objective with this research was to characterize the range of ways that the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic affected pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care experiences. METHODS: Pregnant and recently pregnant patients (n = 20) from obstetrics and gynecology clinical sites associated with Massachusetts General Hospital were interviewed about their experiences with prenatal care, childbirth, and postpartum care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interview transcripts were analyzed for emergent themes. RESULTS: This sample included 20 pregnant and postpartum people, including 11 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy or postpartum and nine with suspected infection. The ways in which COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19 affected experiences of prenatal care, childbirth, and postpartum care were complex and varied. Three themes were identified across narratives of pregnancy, birth, and postpartum care: patient perceptions of diminished access to care, stigma due to COVID-19 infection, and limited capacity of providers to honor patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of pregnant and recently pregnant people's experiences during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic can inform infection control policies and clinical care delivery practices that are more congruent with the needs and values of pregnant, birthing, and postpartum people as institutions craft responses to future pandemics. Approaches that maximize meaningful access across the pregnancy care continuum, center patients' priorities within adapted care models, and honor patient preferences as much as possible are important aspects of an appropriate response to future waves of COVID-19 and other pandemics.",2023,May-Jun,Womens Health Issues,33,3,235-241,,10.1016/j.whi.2022.11.002,36496341,#1297,Jaffe 2023,,,0
Patient preferences for heart valve disease intervention.,Fifer S; Keen B; Guilbert-Wright P; Yamabe K; Murdoch DJ,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine how patients trade-off the benefits and risks of two different types of procedures used to treat heart valve disease (HVD). It also aimed to determine patients' preferences for HVD treatments (predicted uptake) and the relative importance of each treatment attribute. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in Australia and Japan with patients who required a heart valve procedure. Patients were stratified into three categories: no prior procedure experience, minimally invasive procedure experience and invasive procedure experience. DCE attributes included risk of mortality; risk of stroke; needing dialysis; needing a new pacemaker; valve durability; independence 1 month after surgery; and out-of-pocket expenses. Participants chose between two hypothetical labelled approaches to therapy ('invasive procedure' and 'minimally invasive procedure'), with a separate opt-out included. A mixed multinomial logit model was used to analyse preferences. RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 143 Australian and 206 Japanese patients. Both populations demonstrated an overall preference for the minimally invasive procedure over the invasive procedure. All attributes tested significantly predicted choice and were important to patient decision-making. However, patients' choices were most influenced by the durability of the valve and the likelihood of independence postprocedure, irrespective of their prior procedure experience. Differences in preference were observed between Australian and Japanese patients; valve durability was the most important attribute among Australian patients, while Japanese patients emphasised regaining independence postsurgery. Risk of mortality was less important relative to other key attributes in Japan; however, it remained significant to the model. CONCLUSIONS: HVD patients prefer a minimally invasive procedure over an invasive procedure, irrespective of prior treatment experience. Key attributes contributing to treatment preferences are valve durability and faster recovery. These results can be used to help inform healthcare decision-makers about what features of heart valve procedures patients value most. PATIENT AND PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: People with lived experience of HVD were included in multiple stages of the design phase of this research. First, patients and doctors were consulted by taking part in qualitative interviews. The qualitative interviews helped inform which treatment attributes to include in the DCE based on what was important to those with lived experience and those who help make treatment decisions on behalf of patients. Qualitative interview participants also assisted with the framing of questions in the online survey to ensure the terminology was patient-friendly and relevant to those with lived experience. Following qualitative interviews, the DCE attribute list was agreed on in expert consultation with a steering committee, which included patient representatives and treating physicians (interventional cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons). The survey was also pilot tested with a small sample of patients and minor adjustments were made to the wording to ensure it was appropriate and meaningful to those with lived experience of HVD.",2023,Dec,Health Expect,27,1,,,10.1111/hex.13929,38050462,#585,Fifer 2023,,,1
Breast filler granuloma mistaken for implant rupture: A case report.,Hwang YS; Byeon JY; Kim JH; Choi HJ; Oh MH; Lee DW,"RATIONALE: Breast augmentation is usually performed by inserting implants into the breasts. However, injectable fillers are sometimes used for the convenience of both patients and surgeons. If foreign substances, such as biomaterials, are injected into the body, complications such as inflammation, granuloma, and tissue necrosis can occur owing to foreign body reactions. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 39-year-old female patient visited our hospital complaining of tenderness, redness, and swelling in both breasts. The patient had undergone bilateral breast augmentation using implants 4 years prior to current consult. DIAGNOSES: On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cystic lesions and fluid collections were observed, with findings suggesting implant rupture; hence, surgery was planned to remove both implants. INTERVENTIONS: Intraoperatively, the implant was malpositioned in the upper lateral portion without rupture. Capsular contracture findings were also not prominent. A large amount of inflammatory granuloma was observed and removed in the prepectoral plane, and the implants were immediately inserted into a new subpectoral plane. OUTCOMES: The volume of the new implant was 175 mL, which was smaller than the previous one, as per the patient preference. Cytology of the fluid from the previous implant pocket showed no evidence of malignancy, and the granuloma was identified as inflammatory tissue caused by a foreign body reaction on biopsy. The excessive protrusion of both breasts was corrected after surgery, and the patient was satisfied with the aesthetic outcomes without any complications up to 3 months after surgery. LESSONS: The use of injectable fillers for breast augmentation carries the risk of misdiagnosis, and, therefore, surgeons should always exercise caution.",2023,Jun,Medicine (Baltimore),102,22,e33785,,10.1097/MD.0000000000033785,37266617,#1172,Hwang 2023,,,0
Patient preferences for newer oral therapies in type 2 diabetes.,Savarese G; Sharma A; Pang C; Wood R; Soleymanlou N,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate patient preferences towards three oral antihyperglycaemic therapies using conjoint analysis to determine which attributes may influence use. METHODS: We used an online survey, completed by 553 US respondents with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; mean age 64 ± 9 years; 55% had cardiovascular [CV] risk; 27% had CV disease), to present hypothetical, blinded, pairwise, drug profile comparison choices, between different benefit/risk attributes and effect ranges. Attributes were derived from phase 3 trials for empagliflozin 25 mg (SGLT2 inhibitor), oral semaglutide 14 mg (GLP-1 receptor agonist) and sitagliptin 100 mg (DPP-4 inhibitor). Predicted therapy preference outcomes and relative importance of each attribute were calculated (presented as a percentage). RESULTS: Preference score was highest for the profile matching empagliflozin (56%), versus sitagliptin (38%; z-test, P < 0.001) and oral semaglutide (6%, z-test, P < 0.001). Results were overall consistent in subgroup analyses. Genital infection risk was the most important attribute (relative score: 19% [z-test, P = 0.077]). Other important attributes were fasting requirements (15%), weight reduction (15%), risk of vomiting (14%), CV benefit (12%), and risk of nausea (11%). HbA1c reduction (8%) and ability to take medication with other drugs (6%) were considered less important. While blinded to drug name/dose, respondents chose a drug profile similar to empagliflozin (41%) versus sitagliptin (31%), oral semaglutide (11%), or 'none of the options' (17%). CONCLUSION: While the drug profile comparable to empagliflozin was preferred, CV benefit was not the top patient priority. A shared physician-patient decision model and increased patient education are needed to ensure optimal use of guideline-directed T2DM therapies.",2023,Jan,Int J Cardiol,371,,526-532,,10.1016/j.ijcard.2022.09.009,36096275,#1589,Savarese 2023,,,1
Physical function and severe side effects matter most to patients with RA (< 5 years): a discrete choice experiment assessing preferences for personalized RA treatment.,Bywall KS; Esbensen BA; Heidenvall M; Erlandsson I; Lason M; Hansson M; Johansson JV,"AIM: Early assessment of patient preferences has the potential to support shared decisions in personalized precision medicine for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to assess treatment preferences of patients with RA (< 5 years) with previous experience of inadequate response to first-line monotherapy. METHOD: Patients were recruited (March-June 2021) via four clinics in Sweden. Potential respondents (N = 933) received an invitation to answer a digital survey. The survey included an introductory part, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and demographic questions. Each respondent answered 11 hypothetical choice questions as part of the DCE. Patient preferences and preference heterogeneity were estimated using random parameter logit models and latent class analysis models. RESULTS: Patients (n = 182) assessed the most important treatment attributes out of physical functional capacity, psychosocial functional capacity, frequency of mild side effects and likelihood of severe side effects. In general, patients preferred a greater increase in functional capacity and decreased side effects. However, a substantial preference heterogeneity was identified with two underlying preference patterns. The most important attribute in the first pattern was the 'likelihood of getting a severe side effect'. Physical functional capacity was the most important attribute in the second pattern. CONCLUSION: Respondents focused their decision-making mainly on increasing their physical functional capacity or decreasing the likelihood of getting a severe side effect. These results are highly relevant from a clinical perspective to strengthen communication in shared decision making by assessing patients' individual preferences for benefits and risks in treatment discussions.",2023,Jul,BMC Rheumatol,7,1,17,,10.1186/s41927-023-00341-y,37400929,#1079,Bywall 2023,,,1
Tiered Physician Network Plans and Patient Choices of Specialist Physicians.,Prager E; Curto VE; Magyari A; Gaye M; Sinaiko AD,"IMPORTANCE: Tiered physician network (TPN) health plans sort physicians into tiers based on their cost and quality, and patients pay lower copays for visits with physicians in the lower-cost and better-quality tiers. When the plans are first introduced, they lead patients to seek care from higher-value physicians. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether TPNs are associated with patient choice of physician when the plans have been in place for 8 to 12 years and whether there are inequities in patient out-of-pocket costs associated with inequities in access to physicians in lower-copay tiers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study comprising 46 645 physicians and 585 399 patients in TPNs, including 54 683 patients who had a new patient visit with a physician in a TPN, used health insurance claims data from a large employer purchaser from July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2019. Statistical analysis was performed from November 2020 to August 2023. EXPOSURE: Evaluation and management visit with a physician in a TPN. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Main outcomes were new patient market share per physician-carrier-zip code-year, distance from centroid of patient zip code to centroid of zip code of nearest low- or medium-copay physician, and mean TPN physician office visit copay per patient. A regression discontinuity design was used to estimate the association of a physician's tier ranking, and a difference-in-differences analysis was used to estimate the association of copayment differences across tiers with market share among new patients. Equity in access was measured by comparing travel distance to the nearest physician in a low-copay or medium-copay tier and mean copayments across patient incomes. RESULTS: The main analysis sample included 46 645 physician-carrier-zip code-year observations, 9506 (20.4%) of which were in the low-copay tier, 31 798 (68.2%) in the medium-copay tier, and 5341 (11.5%) in the high-copay tier. The 54 683 new patients in the sample had a mean (SD) age of 46.4 (16.7) years and included 33 542 women (61.3%). There was no association of having a worse tier ranking (0.045 percentage points [95% CI, -0.058 to 0.148 percentage points]) or of copayment differences between tiers (0.001 percentage points [95% CI, -0.002 to 0.004 percentage points]) with physician market share among new patients. The patients with the lowest income paid slightly lower mean (SD) copayments for office visits to a TPN physician than the patients with high income ($48.08 [$16.42] vs $51.59 [$16.79], a 6.8% difference). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of TPN health plans, there was no association between physician tier ranking and physician market share among any group of patients. These findings suggest there are limitations in TPNs' steering of patients toward high-value physicians. These plans were not associated with exacerbated health inequity in this setting.",2023,Nov,JAMA Netw Open,6,11,e2341836,,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.41836,37943560,#707,Prager 2023,,,0
Comparison of the Novel Digital Multi-dimension Botong Score with the Brief Pain Inventory for Evaluating Cancer-Related Pain: A Randomized Crossover Trial.,Yan R; Fan B; Luo S; Wang K; Xie G; Wang Y; Wang J,"INTRODUCTION: Pain is a common symptom in patients with cancer, and comprehensive assessments of pain are crucial for decision-making of treatment regimens. This study aimed to compare the practicality of the novel digital multi-dimension Botong score (BTS) and the brief pain inventory (BPI) for evaluating cancer-related pain. METHODS: This randomized crossover trial enrolled patients with cancer-related pain at the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Shandong First Medical University between July and December 2022. The participants were randomized 1:1 to BTS evaluation followed by BPI or vice versa. The consistency of BTS and BPI was analyzed, including pain score and the impact of pain on emotions and sleep. The convenience, patient preference, and the filling time of the two tools were compared. The accuracy of BTS in detecting breakthrough pain and neuropathic pain was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 308 patients with cancer-related pain were screened and 233 were finally included in the analysis. The Pearson correlation coefficients of pain score for BTS and BPI (4 relevant questions) were 0.583 for the worst pain score within 24 h, 0.394 for the mildest pain score within 24 h, 0.551 for the average pain score within 24 h, and 0.511 for the current pain score, respectively (all P < 0.01), indicating a positive correlation between the BTS and BPI pain scores. BTS was superior to BPI for filling time, convenience, and patient preference (191.03 vs. 256.76, 7.70 vs. 6.78, 7.58 vs. 6.70; all P < 0.01). The accuracy of BTS in detecting breakthrough pain and neuropathic pain was 98.28% and 97.42%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pain scores evaluated by BTS have a positive correlation with those evaluated by BPI. BTS reduces the filling time, is more convenient to use, and is more favored by patients. In addition, BTS could help identify breakthrough pain and neuropathic pain.

Patient-related outcomes of conventional impression making versus intraoral scanning for prosthetic rehabilitation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,de Paris Matos T; Wambier LM; Favoreto MW; Rezende CEE; Reis A; Loguercio AD; Gonzaga CC,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Intraoral scanning has been reported to be preferred by patients over conventional impression making. Nevertheless, information regarding patient-related outcomes for conventional impression making and digital scanning is sparse. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze patient-related outcomes of intraoral scanning and conventional impression methods. The primary outcomes evaluated were patient preference and satisfaction, and the secondary outcomes discomfort, nausea, unpleasant taste, breathing difficulty, pain, and anxiety. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual searches were performed for clinical trials that evaluated patient-related outcomes for intraoral scanning and conventional impression making for prosthetic rehabilitation. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa scale were used to assess the quality of the studies. Random-effects models using mean difference were used for meta-analyses. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q test and I(2) statistics (α=.05). RESULTS: The search strategy identified 1626 articles, and 11 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Patients preferred intraoral scanning to conventional impression making. The mean difference for patient preference was 15.02 (95% confidence interval of 8.33 - 21.73; P<.001). Discomfort, absence of nausea, absence of unpleasant taste, and absence of breathing difficulty were also significantly different (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoral scanning is a suitable alternative to conventional impression procedures, promoting less discomfort for patients sensitive to taste, nausea, and breathing difficulty than when conventional impression making techniques are used.",2023,Jul,J Prosthet Dent,130,1,19-27,,10.1016/j.prosdent.2021.08.022,34756424,#1142,deParisMatos 2023,,,0
Patient Preferences in Diagnostic Imaging: A Scoping Review.,Baird TA; Wright DR; Britto MT; Lipstein EA; Trout AT; Hayatghaibi SE,"BACKGROUND: As new diagnostic imaging technologies are adopted, decisions surrounding diagnostic imaging become increasingly complex. As such, understanding patient preferences in imaging decision making is imperative. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to review quantitative patient preference studies in imaging-related decision making, including characteristics of the literature and the quality of the evidence. METHODS: The Pubmed, Embase, EconLit, and CINAHL databases were searched to identify studies involving diagnostic imaging and quantitative patient preference measures from January 2000 to June 2022. Study characteristics that were extracted included the preference elicitation method, disease focus, and sample size. We employed the PREFS (Purpose, Respondents, Explanation, Findings, Significance) checklist as our quality assessment tool. RESULTS: A total of 54 articles were included. The following methods were used to elicit preferences: conjoint analysis/discrete choice experiment methods (n = 27), contingent valuation (n = 16), time trade-off (n = 4), best-worst scaling (n = 3), multicriteria decision analysis (n = 3), and a standard gamble approach (n = 1). Half of the studies were published after 2016 (52%, 28/54). The most common scenario (n = 39) for eliciting patient preferences was cancer screening. Computed tomography, the most frequently studied imaging modality, was included in 20 studies, and sample sizes ranged from 30 to 3469 participants (mean 552). The mean PREFS score was 3.5 (standard deviation 0.8) for the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights that a variety of quantitative preference methods are being used, as diagnostic imaging technologies continue to evolve. While the number of preference studies in diagnostic imaging has increased with time, most examine preventative care/screening, leaving a gap in knowledge regarding imaging for disease characterization and management.",2023,Nov,Patient,16,6,579-591,,10.1007/s40271-023-00646-7,37667148,#725,Baird 2023,,,1
When attitudes and beliefs get in the way of shared decision-making: A mediation analysis of participation preference.,Büdenbender B; Köther AK; Grüne B; Michel MS; Kriegmair MC; Alpers GW,"INTRODUCTION: Certain sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., older age) have previously been identified as barriers to patients' participation preference in shared decision-making (SDM). We aim to demonstrate that this relationship is mediated by the perceived power imbalance that manifests itself in patients' negative attitudes and beliefs about their role in decision-making. METHODS: We recruited a large sample (N = 434) of outpatients with a range of urological diagnoses (42.2% urooncological). Before the medical consultation at a university hospital, patients completed the Patients' Attitudes and Beliefs Scale and the Autonomy Preference Index. We evaluated attitudes as a mediator between sociodemographic factors and participation preference in a path model. RESULTS: We replicated associations between relevant sociodemographic factors and participation preference. Importantly, attitudes and beliefs about one's own role as a patient mediated this relationship. The mediation path model explained a substantial proportion of the variance in participation preference (27.8%). Participation preferences and attitudes did not differ for oncological and nononcological patients. CONCLUSION: Patients' attitudes and beliefs about their role determine whether they are willing to participate in medical decision-making. Thus, inviting patients to participate in SDM should encompass an assessment of their attitudes and beliefs. Importantly, negative attitudes may be accessible to change. Unlike stable sociodemographic characteristics, such values are promising targets for interventions to foster more active participation in SDM. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This study was part of a larger project on implementing SDM in urological practice. Several stakeholders were involved in the design, planning and conduction of this study, for example, three authors are practising urologists, and three are psychologists with experience in patient care. In addition, the survey was piloted with patients, and their feedback was integrated into the questionnaire. The data presented in this study is based on patients' responses. Results may help to empower our patients.",2023,Apr,Health Expect,26,2,740-751,,10.1111/hex.13699,36639880,#1366,Büdenbender 2023,,,0

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 701 participants (20% identifying as Black) enrolled in the International Registry for Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer at 37 US sites from 2017 to 2022. Participants were asked six questions from the Cancer Australia National Cancer Control Indicators about their experience with care at study enrollment. Prevalence differences by self-reported race were estimated using marginal standardization of logistic-normal mixed effects models (adjusted for age at enrollment and disease state at enrollment), and 95% CIs were estimated using parametric bootstrapping. RESULTS: Most participants reported a high quality of care for each question. Black participants generally reported higher care quality compared with White participants. Black participants reported more frequently that they were offered a written assessment and care plan (71%) compared with White participants (58%; adjusted difference, 13 percentage points; 95% CI, 4-23). Black participants also reported more frequently being given the name of nonphysician personnel who would support them (64%) than White participants (52%; adjusted difference, 10; 95% CI, 1-20). Prevalence differences did not differ by disease state at enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: Black participants generally reported a higher quality of care compared with White participants. This study calls attention to the need to study potential mediating factors and interpersonal aspects of care in this population to improve survivorship.",2023,Aug,Cancer,129,16,2532-2541,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT03151629,10.1002/cncr.34885,37246339,#976,Rencsok 2023,,,0
Patient preference for second- and third-line therapies in type 2 diabetes: a prespecified secondary endpoint of the TriMaster study.,Shields BM; Angwin CD; Shepherd MH; Britten N; Jones AG; Sattar N; Holman R; Pearson ER; Hattersley AT,"Patient preference is very important for medication selection in chronic medical conditions, like type 2 diabetes, where there are many different drugs available. Patient preference balances potential efficacy with potential side effects. As both aspects of drug response can vary markedly between individuals, this decision could be informed by the patient personally experiencing the alternative medications, as occurs in a crossover trial. In the TriMaster (NCT02653209, ISRCTN12039221), randomized double-blind, three-way crossover trial patients received three different second- or third-line once-daily type 2 diabetes glucose-lowering drugs (pioglitazone 30 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg and canagliflozin 100 mg). As part of a prespecified secondary endpoint, we examined patients' drug preference after they had tried all three drugs. In total, 448 participants were treated with all three drugs which overall showed similar glycemic control (HbA1c on pioglitazone 59.5 sitagliptin 59.9, canagliflozin 60.5 mmol mol(-1), P = 0.19). In total, 115 patients (25%) preferred pioglitazone, 158 patients (35%) sitagliptin and 175 patients (38%) canagliflozin. The drug preferred by individual patients was associated with a lower HbA1c (mean: 4.6; 95% CI: 3.9, 5.3) mmol mol(-1) lower versus nonpreferred) and fewer side effects (mean: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.64) fewer side effects versus nonpreferred). Allocating therapy based on the individually preferred drugs, rather than allocating all patients the overall most preferred drug (canagliflozin), would result in more patients achieving the lowest HbA1c for them (70% versus 30%) and the fewest side effects (67% versus 50%). When precision approaches do not predict a clear optimal therapy for an individual, allowing patients to try potential suitable medications before they choose long-term therapy could be a practical alternative to optimizing treatment for type 2 diabetes.",2023,Feb,Nat Med,29,2,384-391,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02653209ISRCTN/ISRCTN12039221,10.1038/s41591-022-02121-6,36477734,#1551,Shields 2023,,,0
Americans' Awareness of Access Changes and Utilization of Telehealth During COVID-19: A Survey in the United States.,Cook J; Pittaoulis M; Alderfer J; Gilchrist K; Sapia M,"Background: We examine how and why Americans have experienced interrupted health care during the COVID-19 pandemic and measure awareness and usage of expanded benefits offered by health insurers and employers. We use an expanded concept of health literacy to include knowledge of access conditions and consider if patients' knowledge of the health system may relate to utilization of care. Methods: We conducted an online survey of 451 U.S. adults in September 2020, asking respondents about their health care experiences since March 1, 2020. This survey measured usage of medical care and awareness of the efforts made by government, private insurers, and employers to increase access to benefits such as telehealth services, well-being and mental health programs, and new prescription options. Results: The most common reasons cited for postponing or skipping medical appointments included fears over COVID-19 exposure, following local restrictions, or wanting to preserve resources for those with COVID-19. Our survey also finds that many Americans are largely unaware of whether they have access to expanded benefits implemented during the pandemic. Critically, respondents who recalled telehealth and prescription medication benefits being promoted were more likely to report using such benefits. Conclusion: This research suggests that greater attention to health literacy can help promote participation in the system by patients and has the potential to lead to improved health outcomes and greater adherence to treatment plans. Telehealth may offer patients increased opportunities to consult with their physicians for ailments that they might otherwise have delayed seeking care.",2023,Jan,Telemed J E Health,29,1,60-71,,10.1089/tmj.2021.0485,35736782,#1676,Cook 2023,,,0
Valued Outcomes in the Cancer Experience (VOICE)™: Development and validation of a multidimensional measure of perceived control.,Zaleta AK; Fortune EE; Miller MF; Yuen EYN; McManus S; Hurley K; Golant M; Goldberger S; Shockney LD; Buzaglo JS,"OBJECTIVE: Enhancing cancer patients' sense of control can positively impact psychological well-being. We developed and assessed the psychometric properties of Valued Outcomes in the Cancer Experience (VOICE)(TM), a measure of patients' perceived control over key personal priorities within their cancer experience. METHODS: VOICE construction and testing were completed in three phases with separate participant samples: (1) item generation and initial item pool testing (N = 459), (2) scale refinement (N = 623), and (3) confirmatory validation (N = 515). RESULTS: A 21-item measure was developed that captures cancer patients' sense of control in seven key domains: (1) Purpose and Meaning, (2) Functional Capacity, (3) Longevity, (4) Quality Care, (5) Illness Knowledge, (6) Social Support, and (7) Financial Capability. VOICE demonstrated adequate internal consistency (full-scale α = 0.93; factor α = 0.67-0.89) and adequate to strong convergent and discriminatory validity. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: VOICE measures cancer patients' perceived control across a diverse range of personal priorities, creating a platform for elevating patient perspectives and identifying pathways to enhance patient well-being.

Long-Term Follow Up of Sexual Function and Steroid Levels in Women after Perimenopausal Hysterectomy with or without Concomitant Oophorectomy.,Zimmerman J; Brännström M; Bergdahl C; Aziz A; Hermansson J,"Hysterectomy, most often performed because of bleeding disorders or uterine leiomyoma, is one of the most common major surgical procedures in women and is usually performed during the perimenopausal period on ages 45-55 years. Hysterectomy may be combined with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, as a risk-reducing procedure to minimize the risk of ovarian cancer. An open question is whether concomitant oophorectomy, with cessation of ovarian androgen secretion, has any long-term effects on sexual function. In the present prospective cohort study of women undergoing benign hysterectomy, the long-term (10-12 years) effects on sexual function and changes in sex hormone levels were investigated in women having undergone perimenopausal hysterectomy, with or without concomitant bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Originally, 491 women (mean age around 50 years) were operated with (patient preference) either only hysterectomy (HYST) or hysterectomy plus bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (HYST + BSO), and 441 women (90%; HYST; n = 271 and HYST + BSO; n = 170) completed a one-year survey. In the present study, 185 women (42%) of the cohort with one-year follow up participated in the long-term follow up after 10-12 years. Follow-up was with the 10-item McCoy Female Sex Questionnaire and blood analysis of levels of testosterone, estradiol and sexual-hormone-binding globulin. The results showed that specific aspects of sexual function were lower after HYST + BSO compared to HYST 10-12 years after surgery. These lowered items were frequency of sexual fantasies, enjoyment of sexual activity, sexual arousal, and orgasmic frequency. No long-term differences in sex hormone levels were found between the two groups. In conclusion, some items related to sexual function were lower after HYST + BSO in a long-term perspective study, although the levels of testosterone were unaltered. This finding may have implications for clinical recommendations concerning prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy or for hysterectomy during the perimenopausal age.",2023,Jul,J Clin Med,12,15,,,10.3390/jcm12154976,37568378,#1037,Zimmerman 2023,,,0
"Preference-based patient participation in intermediate care: Translation, validation and piloting of the 4Ps in Norway.",Kvael LAH; Bergland A; Eldh AC,"INTRODUCTION: The implementation and evaluation of patient participation to obtain high-quality transitional care for older people is an international priority. Intermediate care (IC) services are regarded as an important part of the patient's pathway from the specialist to the primary care levels, bridging the gap between the hospital and the home. Patients may experience varying capacities and conditions for patient participation. Yet, few tools for evaluating patients' preferences for patient participation within IC services are at hand. Accordingly, further knowledge is needed to understand and scaffold processes for patient participation in IC. Therefore, the aim of this project was to translate, validate and pilot test the Patient Preferences for Patient Participation (the 4Ps) with patients in IC services in Norway. METHODS: This project comprised two phases: (1) a careful translation and cultural adaptation process, followed by a content validity trial among 15 patients and staff in Norwegian IC and (2) a cross-sectional survey of the instrument with 60 patients admitted to IC. RESULTS: The translation between Swedish and Norwegian required no conceptual or contextual adaptations. The subsequent cross-sectional study, designed as a dialogue between the patients and staff, revealed that only 50% of the participants received a sufficient level of patient participation based on their preferences, mostly indicating that patients were receiving less-than-preferred conditions for engaging in their health and healthcare issues. CONCLUSION: The 4Ps instrument was deemed suitable for measuring patient participation based on patient preferences in the IC context and was feasible for both healthcare professionals and patients to complete in an interview when arriving at and leaving services. This may support person-centred communication and collaboration, calling for further research on what facilitates patient participation and the implementation of person-centred services for patients in IC. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: First, the current paper is part of the IPIC study (i.e., the implementation of patient participation in IC). Influenced by a James Lind Alliance process, the study addresses research uncertainties identified by patients, next of kin, staff and researchers in the cocreation process. Second, cognitive interviewing was conducted with 15 representatives of the target population: seven patients receiving IC services, one home-dwelling previous IC patient (altogether four women and four men, most of them 80 years or older) and seven healthcare staff working in IC services. The interviews determined the relevance, comprehensiveness and clarity of the 4Ps. Finally, 60 patients admitted to IC took part in the cross-sectional study.",2023,Nov,Health Expect,27,1,,,10.1111/hex.13899,37934200,#693,KvaelLAH 2023,,,0
"Which symptom to address in psychological treatment for cancer survivors when fear of cancer recurrence, depressive symptoms, and cancer-related fatigue co-occur? Exploring the level of agreement between three systematic approaches to select the focus of ",Harnas SJ; Booij SH; Csorba I; Nieuwkerk PT; Knoop H; Braamse AMJ,"PURPOSE: To investigate the extent to which three systematic approaches for prioritizing symptoms lead to similar treatment advices in cancer survivors with co-occurring fear of cancer recurrence, depressive symptoms, and/or cancer-related fatigue. METHODS: Psychological treatment advices were was based on three approaches: patient preference, symptom severity, and temporal precedence of symptoms based on ecological momentary assessments. The level of agreement was calculated according to the Kappa statistic. RESULTS: Overall, we found limited agreement between the three approaches. Pairwise comparison showed moderate agreement between patient preference and symptom severity. Most patients preferred treatment for fatigue. Treatment for fear of cancer recurrence was mostly indicated when based on symptom severity. Agreement between temporal precedence and the other approaches was slight. A clear treatment advice based on temporal precedence was possible in 57% of cases. In cases where it was possible, all symptoms were about equally likely to be indicated. CONCLUSIONS: The three approaches lead to different treatment advices. Future research should determine how the approaches are related to treatment outcome. We propose to discuss the results of each approach in a shared decision-making process to make a well-informed and personalized decision with regard to which symptom to target in psychological treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: This study contributes to the development of systematic approaches for selecting the focus of psychological treatment in cancer survivors with co-occurring symptoms by providing and comparing three different systematic approaches for prioritizing symptoms.",2023,Aug,J Cancer Surviv,,,,,10.1007/s11764-023-01423-z,37526860,#1000,Harnas 2023,,,0
Quality of breaking bad news to patients diagnosed with neoplasia of the uterine cervix.,von Blanckenburg P; Köhler C; Petzel A; Jülicher A; Schneider V; Schneider A,"OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the quality of receiving bad news (BN) for women diagnosed with cervical neoplasia. We evaluated adherence to the SPIKES protocol in three cohorts of women with different stages of the disease and treatment modalities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included women with cervical cancer who underwent radical vaginal trachelectomy (RVT group, n = 110), radical hysterectomy or chemo-radiation (HE/RCT group, n = 101), and women with CIN 3 treated by loop excision (CIN group, n = 108). We asked the participants about how they received the bad news delivery in reality and how they would envision an ideal communication process based on the main items of the SPIKES protocol. The participants filled out a questionnaire with 38 items of the Marburg Breaking Bad News (MABBAN) Scale representing the six SPIKES subscales. RESULTS: Only 72% of all patients reported being satisfied with their BBN experience. The following factors were considered important by 90% of the patients: an undisturbed atmosphere, taking enough time, coherent explanation of the disease, and the possibility to ask questions. However, the reality of their experiences fell significantly short of their expectations. Asking about the patient's knowledge of the disease, addressing their concerns, allowing them to show emotions, providing clarity about the change in quality of life, informing them about alternative therapies, and involving them in further planning were also significantly lacking in the actual BBN encounters compared to the patients' preferences. The experience of RVT patients was more negative compared to the HE/RCT patients (p = 0.036). The CIN patients had an overall satisfactory impression (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The process of breaking bad news in German women diagnosed with cervical neoplasia requires substantial improvement. The SPIKES protocol can be used as a guideline for enhancement but should be supplemented by incorporating a second consultation as the norm rather than the exception. Continuous monitoring and improvement of the quality of BBN is recommended for all oncologic institutions, utilizing the MABBAN questionnaire as a valuable tool.",2023,Dec,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,149,19,17215-17222,,10.1007/s00432-023-05442-2,37792062,#616,vonBlanckenburg 2023,,,0

[Vestibular Schwannoma: Factors in Therapy Decision-Making].,Esser J; Walger M; Pollet N; Klußmann JP; Ruge M; Goldbrunner R; Lüers JC,"The treatment of vestibular schwannomas (VS) has always posed a challenge for physicians. Three essential treatment principles are available: wait-and-scan, surgery, and stereotactic radiotherapy. In addition to the type of treatment, decisions must be made regarding the optimal timing of therapy, the combination of different treatment modalities, the potential surgical approach, and the type and intensity of radiation. Factors influencing the therapy decision include tumor location and size or stage, patient age, comorbidities, symptoms, postoperative hearing rehabilitation options, patient preferences, and, not least, the experience of the surgeons and the personnel and technical capabilities of the clinical site.

"""Your cancer is no longer considered cancer"": Psychological reactions to reclassification information and communication preferences.",Mindlis I; Kop M; Teng MS; Revenson TA,"OBJECTIVE: In 2016, the encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (EFVPTC) was reclassified as noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP). This reclassification removed the word ""carcinoma"" and the definition of cancer from the diagnosis. While the nomenclature change was expected to psychologically impact patients, that question has not been systematically explored. Using qualitative methods, we aimed to explore the psychological impact of reclassification on thyroid cancer patients and their preferences for receiving reclassification information. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with nine non-EFVPTC thyroid cancer survivors were conducted. Participants were presented with a hypothetical reclassification scenario, and interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic content analytic approach. RESULTS: Participants expressed a range of psychological reactions to reclassification information, primarily negative, including anger, mistrust, and uncertainty, but also relief. All participants expressed difficulty understanding the concept of reclassification. Communication preferences favored conversation with an established medical provider over written materials, such as a letter. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Communication must align with patient preferences. Being mindful of potential negative psychological reactions when providing information on cancer reclassification is vital.

Digital solution in the follow-up of early breast cancer a randomized study.,Mattson J; Peltola M; Poikonen-Saksela P; Hermanson T; Their J; Färkkilä N; Roine R; Blomqvist C,"BACKGROUND: After primary treatment, patients with early breast cancer (EBC) are followed-up for at least 5 years. At the Helsinki University Hospital (HUS) surveillance includes appointments at 1, 3 and 5 years, and between pre-planned visits a phone call service operated by a nurse practitioner for counseling about symptoms related to side-effects or potential recurrence. In 2015 HUS launched a digital solution for cancer patients. This study was designed to find out patient preference, Health related (HR) quality of life (QOL) and satisfaction with a digital solution compared to a phone call service during the first year of follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with EBC were randomized at the final visit of radiotherapy to surveillance by phone calls or by the digital Noona solution during the first year outside pre-planned visits. After six months the groups were crossed over to the other arm. Primary endpoint was patient preference for either follow-up method among those who had contacted the study nurse at least once by both phone service and digital solution. RESULTS: Out of the 765 patients randomized, 142 had contacted the hospital with both methods and were eligible for inclusion in the analyses of the present study. Out of the 142 patients, 56 preferred phone calls, 43 the digital solution while 43 considered both modalities equal. Preference for the digital solution was higher among patients aged 65 or less. There were no differences in HR QoL or overall satisfaction between the modalities. However, the patients rated the timeliness of response better while using the digital solution. CONCLUSION: Of the patients 30% preferred the digital solution, 40% phone calls while 30% found them equal as the primary follow-up method for EBC during the first year outside pre-planned visits. There is a need to include also digital solutions in surveillance of EBC.

Pharmacological and Non-pharmacological Approaches for the Management of Neuropathic Pain in Multiple Sclerosis.,Shkodina AD; Bardhan M; Chopra H; Anyagwa OE; Pinchuk VA; Hryn KV; Kryvchun AM; Boiko DI; Suresh V; Verma A; Delva MY,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the central nervous system and can cause various types of pain including ongoing extremity pain, Lhermitte's phenomenon, trigeminal neuralgia, and mixed pain. Neuropathic pain is a major concern for individuals with multiple sclerosis as it is directly linked to myelin damage in the central nervous system and the management of neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis is challenging as the options available have limited efficacy and can cause unpleasant side effects. The literature search was conducted across two databases, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Eligible studies included clinical trials, observational studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and narrative reviews. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of literature on pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies employed in the management of neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis. Pharmacological options include cannabinoids, muscle relaxants (tizanidine, baclofen, dantrolene), anticonvulsants (benzodiazepines, gabapentin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine), antidepressants (duloxetine, venlafaxine, tricyclic antidepressants), opioids (naltrexone), and botulinum toxin variants, which have evidence from various clinical trials. Non-pharmacological approaches for trigeminal neuralgia may include neurosurgical methods. Non-invasive methods, physical therapy, and psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction) may be recommended for patients with neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis. The choice of treatment depends on the severity and type of pain as well as other factors, such as patient preferences and comorbidities. There is a pressing need for healthcare professionals and researchers to prioritize the development of better strategies for managing multiple sclerosis-induced neuropathic pain.",2024,Mar,CNS Drugs,38,3,205-224,,10.1007/s40263-024-01072-5,38421578,#282,Shkodina 2024,,,0
Changes to Birth Plans Due to COVID-19: A Survey of Utah Midwives and Doulas.,Ellis J; Ward K; Garrett K; Taylor E; Clark E; Baksh L; Simonsen S,"INTRODUCTION: This study seeks to understand the experiences of Utah midwives and doulas caring for patients during the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Specifically, the goal of the study was to describe the perceived impact on the community birth system and explore differences in the access and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) between in- and out-of-hospital births. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive study design. A 26-item survey developed by the research team was sent via email to Utah birth workers, including nurse-midwives, community midwives, and doulas. Quantitative data were collected during December 2020 and January 2021. Descriptive statistics were used in the analysis. RESULTS: Of the 409 birth workers who were sent a link to the survey, 120 (30%) responded: 38 (32%) CNMs, 30 (25%) direct-entry or community midwives, and 52 (43%) doulas. The majority (79%) reported changes to clinical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Community midwives (71%) who responded indicated practice volume increased. Survey participants reported an increased patient preference for home births (53%) and birth center births (43%). Among those with one or more patient transfers to the hospital, 61% experienced a change in the process. One participant reported that it took 43 minutes longer to transfer to the hospital. Community midwives and doulas reported poor access to a regular source of PPE. DISCUSSION: Survey participants reported changes to planned birth locations during the COVID-19 pandemic. When necessary, transfers to hospitals were reported to be slower. Community midwives and doulas reported having insufficient access to PPE and reported limited knowledge about COVID-19 testing resources and resources for educating patients on COVID-19.

Analysis of Barriers to Public and Private Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs in Patients with Low and High Adherence.,Santos LA; Pinheiro DG; Silva JMD; Borges GLB; Silva PFD; Ricci-Vitor AL; Vanderlei LCM,"INTRODUCTION: Participants in cardiac rehabilitation programs have low adherence to their sessions, which makes extremely important to recognize the barriers that cause non-adherence, identifying whether the type of service and level of adherence influence these barriers. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study, in which 220 individuals (66.80±11.59 years) of both genders who are members of public and private exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs participated. The volunteers were divided according to the level of adherence, considering patients with low adherence (PLA) those with < 70% of attendance and high adherence (PHA) those with > 70%. Then, initial evaluation, Cardiac Rehabilitation Barriers Scale, analysis of socioeconomic level, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Mini-Mental State Examination were applied. RESULTS: Higher total barriers were found in PLA in the public service compared to PHA in the private service (P=0.023). In the subscale ""perceived need"", PHA in the public service showed higher values than PLA and PHA in the private service (P≤0.001). The ""access"" barrier was higher for PHA in the public service when compared to PHA in the private service (P=0.024). PHA in the public service exhibited a higher barrier regarding questions about distance, transportation problems, cost, and time constraints.

Burden and prognostic impact of cardiovascular disease in patients with cancer.,Raisi-Estabragh Z; Manisty CH; Cheng RK; Lopez Fernandez T; Mamas MA,"The number of patients at the intersection of cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increasing, reflecting ageing global populations, rising burden of shared cardiometabolic risk factors, and improved cancer survival. Many cancer treatments carry a risk of cardiotoxicity. Baseline cardiovascular risk assessment is recommended in all patients with cancer and requires consideration of individual patient risk and the cardiotoxicity profile of proposed anticancer therapies. Patients with pre-existing CVD are potentially at high or very high risk of cancer-therapy related cardiovascular toxicity. The detection of pre-existing CVD should prompt cardiac optimisation and planning of surveillance during cancer treatment. In patients with severe CVD, the risk of certain cancer therapies may be prohibitively high. Such decisions require multidisciplinary discussion with consideration of alternative anti-cancer therapies, risk-benefit assessment, and patient preference. Current practice is primarily guided by expert opinion and data from select clinical cohorts. There is need for development of a stronger evidence base to guide clinical practice in cardio-oncology. The establishment of multicentre international registries and national-level healthcare data linkage projects are important steps towards facilitating enrichment of cardio-oncology research programmes.

A telephone survey of 270 surgical patients was conducted across two hospitals two weeks after discharge. Patients preferred verbal (n = 255, 94.8%) and written surgical wound education (n = 178, 66.2%) from medical (n = 229, 85.4%) and nursing staff (n = 211, 78.7%) at discharge. The most frequent education content that patients received was information about follow-up appointments (n = 242, 89.6%) and who to contact in the community with wound care concerns (n = 233, 86.6%). Using logistic regression, patients who perceived that they participated in surgical wound care decisions were 6.5 times more likely to state that they were able to manage their wounds at home. Also, patients who agreed that medical and/or nursing staff discussed wound pain management were 3.1 times more likely to report being able to manage their surgical wounds at home. Only 40% (107/270) of patients actively participated in wound-related decision-making during discharge education. These results uncovered patient preferences, which could be used to optimise discharge education practices.

Use of Acellular Biologic Matrix Envelope for Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Placement to Correct Migration into Submuscular Breast Implant Pocket.,Terry P; Bilchick K; Campbell CA,"Breast implants whether used for cosmetic or reconstructive purposes can be placed in pockets either above or below the pectoralis major muscle, depending on clinical circumstances such as subcutaneous tissue volume, history of radiation, and patient preference. Likewise, cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) can be placed above or below the pectoralis major muscle. When a patient has both devices, knowledge of the pocket location is important for procedural planning and for durability of device placement and performance. Here, we report a patient who previously failed subcutaneous CIED placement due to incision manipulation with prior threatened device exposure requiring plane change to subpectoral pocket. Her course was complicated by submuscular migration of the CIED into her breast implant periprosthetic pocket. With subcutaneous plane change being inadvisable due to patient noncompliance, soft tissue support of subpectoral CIED placement with an acellular biologic matrix (ABM) was performed.

Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Before Radical Cystectomy for Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer: Elective and Eligibility Factors Impacting Utilization.,Patel HD; Naha U; Chen VS; Ko C; Yang R; Druck A; Rac G; Ellis JL; Gupta GN; Woods ME; Gorbonos A; Flanigan R; Quek ML,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to assess utilization of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and etiologies for lack of NAC receipt among patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). METHODS: Patients diagnosed with MIBC undergoing radical cystectomy at a single institution (2005-2021) were included. Patients were categorized by receipt of NAC, and reasons for no NAC were categorized into eligibility and elective factors. Overall survival was analyzed using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models and modeled with Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty patients with MIBC were included; 154 (40.5%) received NAC. Patients were not candidates for NAC due to renal dysfunction (16.6%), clinical contraindications (4.7%), salvage setting (2.1%), and histology (5.3%; total N = 109). Among 271 (71.3%) who were eligible, utilization increased from early (2005-2016) to recent (2016-2021) time periods (34.2% to 85.7% among NAC-eligible, P < .001; 22.8% vs 67.1% among all MIBC, P < .001). Elective factors for not receiving NAC included patient symptoms (7.8%), disease progression concern (7.0%), patient preference/refusal (20.3%) and provider discretion (8.1%) among 271 NAC-eligible patients. Notably, patient preference/refusal decreased from 33.6% to 3.4% in recent years (P < .001). On multivariable analysis, lack of NAC utilization due to renal dysfunction (HR 2.18, P = .002), clinical contraindications (HR 2.62, P = .01), and elective factors (HR 1.88, P = .01) were associated with worse overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: NAC utilization increased over time with 85.7% of eligible patients with MIBC receiving NAC in recent years. Renal dysfunction, patient preference, and clinical contraindications were primary etiologies for lack of NAC. Fewer patients refused NAC in recent years leading to a potential ceiling for NAC utilization.",2024,Jan,Urol Pract,11,1,136-144,,10.1097/UPJ.0000000000000467,37913791,#520,Patel 2024,,,0
Primary Care Team Perspectives on the Suitability of Telehealth Modality (Phone vs Video) at the Veterans Health Administration.,Cannedy S; Leung L; Wyte-Lake T; Balut MD; Dobalian A; Heyworth L; Paige NM; Der-Martirosian C,"INTRODUCTION: Telehealth has the potential to improve access and timeliness of care, enabling primary care teams to deliver hybrid (virtual/in-person) services that will likely extend beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. To optimize its use and sustainability, it is imperative to understand how primary care teams perceive the suitability of telehealth services, including appropriate choice of mode (telephone or video). However, there is limited research on providers' decision-making processes surrounding telehealth use in primary care, including whether to use telephone or video, which this VA-focused study addresses. We examined how primary care (PC) team members determine whether to use telehealth and the mode of delivery, in the care of patients. METHODS: Qualitative case study that included 15 semi-structured interviews with employees who provided or supported telehealth care at primary care clinics at the Veterans Health Administration. We used a team-based rapid analysis approach to identify experiences using telehealth soon after COVID-19's emergence, consisting of the creation of structured summaries of each transcribed interview. The lead author then identified and compiled themes and sub-themes related to the suitability of telehealth in primary care, as well as associated quotes from transcripts. Resulting themes and quotes were reviewed and validated by 2 members of the project team. RESULTS: Primary care team members considered several factors when assessing both the suitability of telehealth for appointments, and mode of use. They were largely guided by patient-related factors including patient preferences, specific health issues, and access to technology. Additional considerations centered on team members' personal preferences and factors that supported the wellbeing of the team, such as the flexibility to work from home (work-life balance) and protection from infection. Generally, participants viewed the option of both telephone and video telehealth modalities as useful tools in the care of patients although a few respondents emphasized its inferiority to in-person care. CONCLUSIONS: Determining the suitability of telehealth services, including appropriate choice of mode is complex. Its suitability is tied to a variety of factors related to multilevel resources, preferences, and timing. When appropriate, telehealth should be considered a useful tool in the care of patients and for employee well-being.",2023,Jan-Dec,J Prim Care Community Health,14,,21501319231172897,,10.1177/21501319231172897,37170906,#1616,Cannedy 2023,,,0
Patient preferences and experiences regarding thrombopoietin-receptor agonists for immune thrombocytopenia in The Netherlands (TRAPeze Netherlands study).,Jansen AJG; McDonald V; Newland A; Morgan M; Bastiaanse M; Wilson K; Eriksson D; Geldman E; Daykin-Pont O; Prince S; Zwaginga JJ,"OBJECTIVE: Identify patient experience and preference towards thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) in treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in the Netherlands. METHODS: The Thrombopoietin-Receptor Agonist Patient experience (TRAPeze) survey used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit patient preferences and a patient burden survey (PBS) to evaluate the clinical and social impact of ITP. TRAPeze collected responses from 6th October to 19th November 2021. RESULTS: Seventy-six respondents completed the DCE: treatment preference appeared to be driven by method of administration (odds ratio [OR] 4.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.88-6.52), frequency of dosing (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.86-2.92) and drug-food interactions (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.54-2.37). Respondents preferred therapies delivered orally over subcutaneous injection (OR 4.22; 95% CI 2.76-6.46), dosed once weekly over once daily (OR 2.37; 95% CI 1.58-3.54) and without food restrictions over with restrictions (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.52-2.38). Sixty-nine respondents completed the DCE and PBS (mean [range] age 53 [19-83] years, 65% female). Seven incomplete PBS responses were excluded from analysis. Respondents were currently, or most recently, receiving eltrombopag (n = 43) or romiplostim (n = 26), of which 30% (n = 21/69) had previously received another TPO-RA. Loss (29%, n = 6/21) and lack (29%, n = 6/21) of response were the most common reasons for switching TPO-RA. Only 28% (n = 18/65) of respondents felt their TPO-RA increased energy levels. CONCLUSION: Patients preferred therapies delivered orally, dosed less frequently and without food restrictions. QoL of ITP patients on TPO-RAs can be improved; the burden analyses presented can inform future efforts towards this.",2023,Dec,Hematology,28,1,2267942,,10.1080/16078454.2023.2267942,37818773,#614,JansenAJG 2023,,,1
'My doctor should decide' - Predictors for healthcare users' stated preferences regarding medical decision-making.,Birkeland S; Bismark M; Barry MJ; Möller S,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate predictors for healthcare users' declared decision control preferences and test their association with satisfaction in vignettes detailing various decision-making. METHODS: Cross-sectional vignette survey within a representative general male population aged 45-70 years (response rate 30%). Survey vignettes illustrated different levels of patient involvement. Participants rated their satisfaction with healthcare illustrated and separately rated their 'control preferences'. Comparisons were conducted with linear regression. RESULTS: Preferring the doctor to predominantly or exclusively decide (1588/6755 respondents) was associated with older age, being single, lower education, having chronic illness, and living in low-income and less populated areas, with fewer non-western immigrants. Following adjustment, lower education and chronic illness remained statistically significant. Personalities with less openness had preference for least control. When presented with specific clinical scenarios, respondents preferring active or passive roles were equally satisfied with scenarios demonstrating shared decision-making. DISCUSSION: Some groups of healthcare users were more likely to say that they preferred their doctor to decide. However, findings suggest that control preference statements, prior to facing a decision, should be interpreted with caution. PRACTICAL VALUE: Study findings highlight that patients vary regarding their expressed wish for control in medical decision-making but they seem equally satisfied with shared decision-making scenarios.",2023,Sep,Patient Educ Couns,114,,107825,,10.1016/j.pec.2023.107825,37269622,#935,Birkeland 2023,,,0
Exploring the Preferences of the Australian Public for Antibiotic Treatments: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,Degeling C; Yarwood T; Nettel-Aguirre A; Mullan J; Reynolds N; Chen G,"OBJECTIVES: Identify Australian public preferences for antibiotic treatments in the context of antibiotic stewardship. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in Australia to investigate the importance of seven attributes associated with antibiotic treatments and related stewardship practices: contribution to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), treatment duration, side effects, days needed to recover, days before taking antibiotics, treatment failure and out-of-pocket costs. The DCE data were analysed using conditional logit, mixed logit and latent class conditional logit models. The relative importance of each attribute was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 1882 respondents completed the survey; the main study sample consist of 1658 respondents (mean age 48 years) who passed quality checks. All seven attributes significantly influenced respondents' preferences for antibiotic treatments. Based on the designed attribute levels in the DCE, on average, out-of-pocket costs (32.8%) and contribution to antibiotic resistance (30.3%) were the most important attributes, followed by side effects (12.9%). Days before starting medication was least important (3.9%). Three latent classes were identified. Class 1 (including respondents who were more likely to be older and more health literate; 24.5%) gave contribution to antibiotic resistance greater importance in treatment preferences. Class 2 (including respondents more likely to report poorer health; 25.2%) gave out-of-pocket costs greater importance. The remaining (50.4%), who were generally healthier, perceived side effects as the most important attribute. CONCLUSIONS: Despite concerted public awareness raising campaigns, our results suggest that several factors may influence the preferences of Australians when considering antibiotic use. However, for those more likely to be aware of the need to preserve antibiotics, out-of-pocket costs and limiting the contribution to antibiotic resistance are the dominant influence. Delays in starting treatment were not important for any latent class, suggesting public tolerance for this measure. These results could help inform strategies to promote prudent antibiotic stewardship.",2023,Sep,Patient,16,5,555-567,,10.1007/s40271-023-00640-z,37462880,#913,Degeling 2023,,,1
Phases and Transitions of Serious Illness: A Structure for Teaching Palliative Care.,Harden KL; Price DM; Bigelow AD; Mason H,"BACKGROUND: Palliative care (PC) focuses on listening to patient preferences, goals, and values to help health care providers educate, support, and collaborate during challenging disease processes, demanding treatments, and difficult decision-making. METHOD: A recently developed Phases and Transitions Model for Serious Illness helps guide nursing students in initiating therapeutic conversations about PC. Each phase and transition shows unique characteristics of illness and treatment to clarify the importance of introducing PC for that phase. Interventions in education, support, and treatment help students guide patients and families through the trajectory of serious illness. RESULTS: The Phases and Transitions Model for Serious Illness and PC interventions provide a clear and practical structure to educate and empower nursing students to engage in PC conversations. CONCLUSION: Nursing educators can integrate this new model to broaden the perspective of PC as an everyday nursing practice for patients who have a serious illness.

Comparison of direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin in chronic limb-threatening ischemia.,Rockhold M; Kunkel L; Lacoste JL; Szymanski T; Rothenberg P; Zimmerman P; Minc S,"OBJECTIVE: The role of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in chronic limb-threatening ischemia after revascularization is unknown. Current evidence-based guidelines do not provide clear guidance on the role of anticoagulation or the selection of anticoagulant. Current practice is highly varied and based on provider and patient preference. The purpose of this study was to measure the impact of different anticoagulants on the incidence of major adverse limb events (MALEs) after revascularization for chronic limb-threatening ischemia, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for major bleeding events. METHODS: This was a single-center, observational, retrospective cohort study. Subjects were eligible if they were 18 years or older; underwent endovascular or open revascularization for chronic limb-threatening ischemia, rest pain, or tissue loss; and were subsequently prescribed apixaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin. The primary end point was the incidence of MALEs, including above-ankle amputation or major index-limb reintervention, within 1 year of index event. Secondary end points included the rate of all-cause mortality, MACEs, and incidence of International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding. RESULTS: From January 1, 2017, to September 20, 2022, 141 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were reviewed. The median age was 67 years, with 92 patients prescribed apixaban or rivaroxaban and 49 patients prescribed warfarin. Of these, 42 patients were prescribed triple antithrombotic therapy, 88 dual antithrombotic therapy, and 13 anticoagulant monotherapy. The primary outcome of 1-year MALEs occurred in 36.7% of the warfarin group and 33.7% of the DOAC group (relative risk [RR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.53-2.25; P = .72). Secondary outcomes of 1-year MACEs (10.2% vs 4.3%; RR, 2.35; 95% CI, 0.60-9.18; P = .18) and 1-year all-cause mortality (26.5% vs 16.3%; RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.70-3.78; P = .15) did not differ between the groups. The secondary safety outcome of 1-year ISTH major bleeding occurred in 16.3% of the warfarin group and 4.3% of the DOAC group (RR, 3.76; 95% CI, 1.07-13.19; P = .015). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia who were revascularized and prescribed anticoagulation with apixaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin on discharge, no difference in MALEs, MACEs, or all-cause mortality was found. However, 1-year admissions for ISTH major bleeding were significantly higher among patients prescribed warfarin. A randomized trial may confirm these findings.",2024,Jan,J Vasc Surg,,,,,10.1016/j.jvs.2024.01.196,38278371,#458,Rockhold 2024,,,0
Facilitators and barriers to using telemedicine for gender-affirming care in gender-diverse youth: A qualitative study.,Inwards-Breland DJ; Yeh D; Marinkovic M; Richardson TR; Marino-Kibbee B; Bayley A; Rhee KE,"INTRODUCTION: Access to gender-affirming care (GAC) is limited for gender-diverse (GD) youth, with the potential for further limitations given the current political climate. GAC has been shown to improve the mental health of GD youth and telemedicine (TM) could increase access to GAC. With limited data on the acceptability and feasibility of TM for GAC among GD youth, we sought to further explore their perspectives on the use of TM in their care. METHODS: We used a semi-structured interview guide, with prompts developed to explore participants' knowledge of TM, identify factors that influenced use, and advantages or disadvantages of use. RESULTS: Thirty GD participants aged 13-21 years old participated in TM. While TM was not the preferred option for medical visits, it was recognized as a practical option for providing GAC. Various actual and perceived disadvantages noted by youth included, technical issues interrupting the visit, not receiving care equivalent to that of an in-person visit, having to see themselves on the screen, family members interrupting visits, and meeting new staff while connecting to a TM visit. The advantages, however, were an increased autonomy and convenience of TM, especially when used for specific aspects of GAC. DISCUSSION: The use of TM in GAC could be optimized by limiting camera use, eliminating/reducing staff involvement, being sensitive to privacy issues, and alternating TM with in-person visits. Clinicians should be cognizant of patient preferences and concerns and be flexible with visit types.",2024,Feb,J Telemed Telecare,,,1357633X241231015,,10.1177/1357633X241231015,38400512,#343,Inwards-Breland 2024,,,0
Improving oncology first-in-human and Window of opportunity informed consent forms through participant feedback.,Avinger AM; Sibold HC; Campbell G; Abernethy E; Bourgeois J; McClary T; Blee S; Dixon M; Harvey RD; Pentz RD,"BACKGROUND: Although patient advocates have developed templates for standard consent forms, evaluating patient preferences for first in human (FIH) and window of opportunity (Window) trial consent forms is critical due to their unique risks. FIH trials are the initial use of a novel compound in study participants. In contrast, Window trials give an investigational agent over a fixed duration to treatment naïve patients in the time between diagnosis and standard of care (SOC) surgery. Our goal was to determine the patient-preferred presentation of important information in consent forms for these trials. METHODS: The study consisted of two phases: (1) analyses of oncology FIH and Window consents; (2) interviews of trial participants. FIH consent forms were analyzed for the location(s) of information stating that the study drug has not been tested in humans (FIH information); Window consents were analyzed for the location(s) of information stating the trial may delay SOC surgery (delay information). Participants were asked about their preferred placement of the information in their own trial's consent form. The location of information in the consent forms was compared to the participants' suggestions for placement. RESULTS: 34 [17 FIH; 17 Window] of 42(81%) cancer patients approached participated. 25 consents [20 FIH; 5 Window] were analyzed. 19/20 FIH consent forms included FIH information, and 4/5 Window consent forms included delay information. 19/20(95%) FIH consent forms contained FIH information in the risks section 12/17(71%) patients preferred the same. Fourteen (82%) patients wanted FIH information in the purpose, but only 5(25%) consents mentioned it there. 9/17(53%) Window patients preferred delay information to be located early in the consent, before the ""Risks"" section.  3/5(60%) consents did this. CONCLUSIONS: Designing consents that reflect patient preferences more accurately is essential for ethical informed consent; however, a one-size fits all approach will not accurately capture patient preferences. We found that preferences differed for FIH and Window trial consents, though for both, patients preferred key risk information early in the consent. Next steps include determining if FIH and Window consent templates improve understanding.",2023,Feb,BMC Med Ethics,24,1,12,,10.1186/s12910-023-00890-4,36803249,#1511,Avinger 2023,,,0
Evaluating Patient Preferences and Clinical Outcomes for Modified Laparoscopic Burch Colposuspension and Transobturator Tape Procedures in Stress Urinary Incontinence Treatment.,Brasoveanu S; Balulescu L; Grigoraș D; Erdelean D; Olaru F; Bardan R; Balint O; Margan MM; Alexandru A; Cristiana-Smaranda I; Pirtea L,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide an in-depth analysis of patient preferences and clinical outcomes associated with two prominent surgical techniques for treating Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI): the modified laparoscopic Burch colposuspension and the transobturator tape (TOT) procedure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted on 145 patients who recieved surgical treatment for SUI, of which 71 patients (49%) underwent the modified laparoscopic Burch procedure, while 74 patients (51%) received the TOT procedure. Data on clinical characteristics, treatment success rates, and postoperative outcomes were collected and analyzed to understand patient preferences and real-world clinical effectiveness. RESULTS: This study revealed notable differences in patient demographics and clinical characteristics between the two groups. At the 2-year follow-up, a success rate of 100% was reported in the modified laparoscopic Burch group and 86.48% in the TOT group. A total of 99 patients (68.28%) were considered cured postoperatively, with 47 (66.20%) in the modified laparoscopic Burch group and 52 (70.27%) in the TOT group (p = 0.598). A significant difference was found in the incidence of dyspareunia, with six cases (8.10%) reported in the TOT group, compared to none reported in the modified laparoscopic Burch group (p = 0.028). The median operation time was significantly shorter in the TOT group, namely 15 min, compared to the modified laparoscopic Burch group, which had a median equal to 27 min (p < 0.001). Despite these differences, patient preference for either surgical technique was observed, along with similar success rates and varied postoperative outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide a comprehensive overview of patient preferences and factual clinical outcomes for the two surgical techniques in SUI treatment. This study contributes to understanding the factors influencing patient choice and offers valuable insights into the real-world application of these techniques, enhancing patient-centered care in SUI management.",2024,Mar,Life (Basel),14,3,,,10.3390/life14030380,38541705,#238,Brasoveanu 2024,,,0
Evaluation of a Clinic-Based Exercise Program in Patients with Pancreatic Cancer Undergoing Nonsurgical Treatment.,Luo H; Galvão DA; Newton RU; Tang CI; Hart NH; Singh F; Dean A; Jasas K; Johansson M; Yusoff I; Spry N; Taaffe DR,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence regarding the role of exercise in pancreatic cancer (PanCa) is limited and is derived exclusively under tightly controlled research conditions. This study aimed to quantify adherence, adverse events, and changes in physical and psychological outcomes in any patients with PanCa referred to undertake exercise during nonsurgical treatment. METHODS: The study involved 22 patients with localized or metastatic PanCa undertaking a clinic-based exercise program during chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. The program included supervised aerobic and resistance exercise undertaken twice weekly for 12 wk and a 12-wk follow-up with supervised exercise optional dependent on patient preference and condition. Patients were monitored for adherence and adverse events. Objective and patient-reported outcomes were assessed at baseline, 12 wk, and 24 wk. RESULTS: A total of 251 sessions were attended by 19 patients over the first 12 wk (attendance rate, 55%). Complete case analyses indicated significant ( P < 0.05) improvements in functional ability (5.2%-17.2%), muscle strength (16.9%-25.1%), and static balance (6.8%). There were no significant changes in body composition or patient-reported outcomes except for sleep quality, which deteriorated; however, at an individual level, several patients had clinically relevant improvements in cancer-related fatigue and quality of life. Patients who continued with supervised exercise to week 24 largely preserved improvements in functional ability, muscle strength, and static balance. No serious adverse events resulted from the exercise program. CONCLUSIONS: Individualized, supervised aerobic and resistance exercise in a clinic-based setting appears to be safe and may improve or maintain physical and psychological health in patients with PanCa undergoing nonsurgical treatment.",2023,Jan,Med Sci Sports Exerc,55,1,9-19,,10.1249/MSS.0000000000003019,35941522,#1668,Luo 2023,,,0
Research Knowledge Translation in Sensory Integration-Based Therapy: Exploring Subjectivity of Clinical Expertise.,Bird DE; Rihtman T,"Background. Clinical expertise is the mechanism through which practitioners implement other components of evidence-based practice (EBP). Within occupational therapy practice, intervention approaches that are both closely and loosely aligned with Ayres' Theory of Sensory Integration are widespread, offering a unique opportunity to investigate the subjective nature of clinical expertise in EBP. Purpose. This qualitative study explored motivations to offer sensory integration-based interventions, and factors informing occupational therapists' clinical decision making in relation to an arguably contentious evidence base. Method. Six post-graduate sensory integration trained UK occupational therapists participated in individual semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed, member-checked and analyzed using thematic coding analysis. Findings. Despite sound understanding of theory and continuous efforts to develop clinical knowledge, non-traditional hierarchies of evidence notably inform clinical decisions. The clinical expertise required for integration of patient preferences, clinical state and circumstances, and research evidence is informed by pragmatic responses to facilitators and barriers across contexts, combined with unique profession-specific identity factors. Implications. While empirical healthcare research is ideally undertaken under controlled conditions, realities of clinical practice are rarely so clear cut. Study findings highlight important subjective factors that are central to real-world research knowledge translation and further understanding of the clinical expertise component of EBP.",2024,Jan,Can J Occup Ther,,,84174231223875,,10.1177/00084174231223875,38232975,#468,Bird 2024,,,0
Safety and Efficacy of Outpatient Anterior Cervical Disk Replacement (ACDR) in an Ambulatory Surgery Center Versus Hospital Setting: A 2-year Retrospective Analysis.,Patel N; Carota Hanley K; Coban D; Changoor S; Abdelmalek G; Sinha K; Hwang K; Emami A,"STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical outcomes of outpatient anterior cervical disk replacements (ACDR) performed in free-standing private ambulatory surgery centers versus tertiary hospital centers. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: ACDR is an increasingly popular technique for treating various degenerative pathologies of the cervical spine. There has been an increase in the utilization of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) for outpatient cervical procedures due to economic and convenience benefits; however, a paucity of literature exists in evaluating long-term safety and efficacy of ACDRs performed in ASCs versus outpatient hospital centers. METHODS: A retrospective cohort review of all patients undergoing 1- or 2-level ACDRs at 2 outpatient ASCs and 4 tertiary care medical centers from 2012 to 2020, with a minimum follow-up of 24 months, was performed. Approval by each patient's insurance and patient preference determined distribution into an ASC or non-ASC. Demographics, perioperative data, length of follow-up, complications, and revision rates were analyzed. Functional outcomes were assessed using VAS and NDI at follow-up visits. RESULTS: One hundred seventeen patients were included (65 non-ASC and 52 ASC). There were no significant differences in demographics or length of follow-up between the cohorts. ASC patients had significantly lower operative times (ASC: 89.5 minutes vs. non-ASC: 110.5 minutes, P<0.001) and mean blood loss (ASC: 17.5 mL vs. non-ASC: 25.3 mL, P<0.001). No significant differences were observed in rates of dysphagia (ASC: 21.2% vs. non-ASC: 15.6%, P<0.001), infection (ASC: 0.0% vs. non-ASC: 1.6%, P=0.202), ASD (ASC: 1.9% vs. non-ASC: 1.6%, P=0.202), or revision (ASC: 1.9% vs. non-ASC: 0.0%, P=0.262). Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in VAS and NDI scores (P<0.001), but no significant differences in the degree of improvement were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our 2-year results demonstrate that ACDRs performed in ASCs may offer the advantages of reduced operative time and blood loss without an increased risk of postoperative complications.",2024,Feb,Clin Spine Surg,,,,,10.1097/BSD.0000000000001591,38366345,#363,Patel 2024,,,0
An update on absolute and relative indications for dialysis treatment modalities.,Lambie M; Davies S,"BACKGROUND: Choosing a dialysis modality is an important decision for people to make as their kidney failure progresses. In doing so, their options should be informed by any absolute or relative indications that may favour one modality over another. METHODS: In creating this update, we reviewed literature using a framework that considered first, high-level outcomes (survival and modality transition) from large registry data and cohort studies when considering optimal patient pathways; second, factors at a dialysis provider level that might affect relative indications; and third, specific patient-level factors. Both main types of dialysis modality, peritoneal (PD) and haemodialysis (HD), and their subtypes were considered. RESULTS: For most people starting dialysis, survival is independent of modality, including those with diabetes. Better survival is seen in those with less comorbidity starting with PD or home HD, reflecting continued improvements over recent decades that have been greater than improvements seen for centre HD. There are provider-level differences in the perceived relative indications for home dialysis that appear to reflect variability in experience, prejudice, enthusiasm, and support for patients and carers. Absolute contraindications are uncommon and, in most cases, where modality prejudice exists, e.g. obesity, Adult Polycystic Kidney Disease, and social factors, this is not supported by reported outcomes. CONCLUSION: Absolute contraindications to a particular dialysis modality are rare. Relative indications for or against particular modalities should be considered but are rarely more important than patient preferences.",2023,Sep,Clin Kidney J,16,Suppl 1,i39-i47,,10.1093/ckj/sfad062,37711635,#879,Lambie 2023,,,0
Physician- and Patient-Elicited Barriers and Facilitators to Implementation of a Machine Learning-Based Screening Tool for Peripheral Arterial Disease: Preimplementation Study With Physician and Patient Stakeholders.,Ho V; Brown Johnson C; Ghanzouri I; Amal S; Asch S; Ross E,"BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is underdiagnosed, partially due to a high prevalence of atypical symptoms and a lack of physician and patient awareness. Implementing clinical decision support tools powered by machine learning algorithms may help physicians identify high-risk patients for diagnostic workup. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a novel machine learning-based screening tool for PAD among physician and patient stakeholders using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). METHODS: We performed semistructured interviews with physicians and patients from the Stanford University Department of Primary Care and Population Health, Division of Cardiology, and Division of Vascular Medicine. Participants answered questions regarding their perceptions toward machine learning and clinical decision support for PAD detection. Rapid thematic analysis was performed using templates incorporating codes from CFIR constructs. RESULTS: A total of 12 physicians (6 primary care physicians and 6 cardiovascular specialists) and 14 patients were interviewed. Barriers to implementation arose from 6 CFIR constructs: complexity, evidence strength and quality, relative priority, external policies and incentives, knowledge and beliefs about intervention, and individual identification with the organization. Facilitators arose from 5 CFIR constructs: intervention source, relative advantage, learning climate, patient needs and resources, and knowledge and beliefs about intervention. Physicians felt that a machine learning-powered diagnostic tool for PAD would improve patient care but cited limited time and authority in asking patients to undergo additional screening procedures. Patients were interested in having their physicians use this tool but raised concerns about such technologies replacing human decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Patient- and physician-reported barriers toward the implementation of a machine learning-powered PAD diagnostic tool followed four interdependent themes: (1) low familiarity or urgency in detecting PAD; (2) concerns regarding the reliability of machine learning; (3) differential perceptions of responsibility for PAD care among primary care versus specialty physicians; and (4) patient preference for physicians to remain primary interpreters of health care data. Facilitators followed two interdependent themes: (1) enthusiasm for clinical use of the predictive model and (2) willingness to incorporate machine learning into clinical care. Implementation of machine learning-powered diagnostic tools for PAD should leverage provider support while simultaneously educating stakeholders on the importance of early PAD diagnosis. High predictive validity is necessary for machine learning models but not sufficient for implementation.",2023,Nov,JMIR Cardio,7,,e44732,,10.2196/44732,37930755,#696,Ho 2023,,,0

What drives researcher preferences for chemical compounds? Evidence from conjoint analysis.,Sung B; Park KM; Park CG; Kim YH; Lee J; Jin TE,"We investigated the attributes and attribute levels that affect researcher preferences for chemical compounds. We conducted a conjoint analysis on survey data of Korean researchers using chemical compounds from the Korean Chemical Bank (KCB). The analysis estimated the part-worth utility for each attribute's level, calculated relative importance of attributes, and classified user segmentation with different patterns. The results show that the structure database offers the highest part-worth utility to researchers, followed by high new functionality, price, screening service, and drug action data provided only by the KCB. Notably, researchers view the offer of a structured database and high new functionality as more important than other attributes in decision-making about research and development of chemical compounds. Furthermore, the results of segmentation analysis demonstrated that researchers have distinct usage patterns of chemical compounds: researchers consider structure database and high new functionality in cluster 1; and high new functionality and price in cluster 2, to be the most appealing. We discussed some policy and strategic implications based on the findings of this study and proposed some limitations.",2023,,PLoS One,18,11,e0294576,,10.1371/journal.pone.0294576,38011085,#657,Sung 2023,,,0
Racial Inequities in Access to Ventricular Assist Device and Transplant Persist After Consideration for Preferences for Care: A Report From the REVIVAL Study.,Cascino TM; Colvin MM; Lanfear DE; Richards B; Khalatbari S; Mann DL; Taddei-Peters WC; Jeffries N; Watkins DC; Stewart GC; Aaronson KD,"BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in access to advanced therapies for heart failure (HF) patients are well documented, although the reasons remain uncertain. We sought to determine the association of race on utilization of ventricular assist device (VAD) and transplant among patients with access to care at VAD centers and if patient preferences impact the effect. METHODS: We performed an observational cohort study of ambulatory chronic systolic HF patients with high-risk features and no contraindication to VAD enrolled at 21 VAD centers and followed for 2 years in the REVIVAL study (Registry Evaluation of Vital Information for VADs in Ambulatory Life). We used competing events cause-specific proportional hazard methodology with multiple imputation for missing data. The primary outcomes were (1) VAD/transplant and (2) death. The exposures of interest included race (Black or White), additional demographics, captured social determinants of health, clinician-assessed HF severity, patient-reported quality of life, preference for VAD, and desire for therapies. RESULTS: The study included 377 participants, of whom 100 (26.5%) identified as Black. VAD or transplant was performed in 11 (11%) Black and 62 (22%) White participants, although death occurred in 18 (18%) Black and 36 (13%) White participants. Black race was associated with reduced utilization of VAD and transplant (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.23-0.85]) without an increase in death. Preferences for VAD or life-sustaining therapies were similar by race and did not explain racial disparities. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients receiving care by advanced HF cardiologists at VAD centers, there is less utilization of VAD and transplant for Black patients even after adjusting for HF severity, quality of life, and social determinants of health, despite similar care preferences. This residual inequity may be a consequence of structural racism and discrimination or provider bias impacting decision-making. REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.

Evaluating Measurement Properties of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Glaucoma: A Systematic Review.,Vinokurtseva A; Quinn MP; Wai M; Leung V; Malvankar-Mehta M; Hutnik CML,"TOPIC: The purpose of the current study was to systematically identify and evaluate existing patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for clinical glaucoma practice. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Understanding and incorporating patient preferences into decision-making is now recognized as critical for optimal resource allocation, especially in technologically advancing areas, such as minimally invasive surgeries. Patient-reported outcome measures are instruments designed to evaluate the health outcomes that are most important to patients. Despite their recognized importance, especially in the era of patient-centered care, their routine use in clinical settings remains low. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in 6 databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, BIOSIS, and Web of Science) from the date of inception. Studies were included in the qualitative review if they reported measurement properties of PROMs in adult patients with glaucoma. COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments guidelines were used to assess the included PROMs. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42020176064). RESULTS: The literature search yielded 2661 records. After deduplication, 1259 studies entered level 1 screening, and based on title and abstract review, 164 records proceeded to full-text screening. In 48 included studies, 70 instrument reports discuss 43 distinct instruments in 3 major categories: glaucoma-specific, vision-specific, and general health-related quality of life. Most used measures were glaucoma-specific (Glaucoma Quality of Life [GQL] and Glaucoma Symptom Scale [GSS]) and vision-specific (National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire [NEI VFQ-25]). All 3 have sufficient validity (especially construct), with GQL and GSS having sufficient internal consistency, cross-cultural validity, and reliability, with reports suggesting high methodological quality. CONCLUSION: The GQL, GSS, and NEI VFQ-25 are the 3 most used questionnaires in a research setting, having considerable validation in a patient population with glaucoma. Limited reports on interpretability, responsiveness, and feasibility in all 43 identified instruments make identifying a single optimal questionnaire for clinical use challenging and highlight the need for further studies.

Patient preferences for treatment modalities for localised prostate cancer.,Teunissen FR; Hehakaya C; Meijer RP; van Melick HHE; Verkooijen HM; van der Voort van Zyp JRN,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the patient preferences and utility scores for the different conventional and innovative treatment modalities for localised prostate cancer (PCa). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients treated for localised PCa and healthy volunteers were invited to fill out a treatment-outcome scenario questionnaire. Participants ranked six different treatments for localised PCa from most to least favourable, prior to information. In a next step, treatment procedures, toxicity, risk of biochemical recurrence and follow-up regimen were comprehensibly described for each of the six treatments (i.e. treatment-outcome scenarios), after which patients re-ranked the six treatments. Additionally, participants gave a visual analogue scale (VAS) and time trade-off (TTO) score for each scenario. Differences between utility scores were tested by Friedman tests with post hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Eighty patients and twenty-nine healthy volunteers were included in the study. Before receiving treatment-outcome scenario information, participants ranked magnetic resonance-guided adaptive radiotherapy most often as their first choice (35%). After treatment information was received, active surveillance was most often ranked as the first choice (41%). Utility scores were significantly different between the six treatment-outcome scenarios, and active surveillance, non- and minimal-invasive treatments received higher scores. CONCLUSIONS: Active surveillance and non-invasive treatment for localised PCa were the most preferred options by PCa patients and healthy volunteers and received among the highest utility scores. Treatment preferences change after treatment information is received.",2023,Mar,BJUI Compass,4,2,214-222,,10.1002/bco2.198,36816141,#1443,Teunissen 2023,,,1
Translation and validation of the Sindhi version of the general medication adherence scale in patients with chronic diseases.,Islam MA; Iffat W; Imam S; Shakeel S; Rasheed A; Naqvi AA,"Background: There is no medication adherence scale available in Sindhi language currently. Hence, the Sindhi speaking population will either use a translator or provide their medical history in another language for documentation of medical conditions. This poses a challenge in monitoring and evaluating adherence to medications within this linguistic community. Aim: The aim of this study was to translate and validate the Sindhi version of the General Medication Adherence Scale (GMAS-S) in patients with chronic diseases. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 4 months duration and was conducted in out-patient department of a university affiliated hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. All adults with chronic diseases, who were on long-term medications, and able to read and understand Sindhi language were invited. Convenience sampling was employed and a questionnaire consisting of demographic questions and the Sindhi version of GMAS was used. The translation of the scale was carried out. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted, and a structural equation model (SEM) was developed. Fit indices, namely, goodness of fit index (GFI), adjusted goodness of fit index (AGFI), Tucker Lewis index (TLI), comparative fit index (CFI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) were reported. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha (α), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), corrected item-to-total correlation (ITC) and item deletion. Data were analysed through IBM SPSS version 23 and IBM AMOS version 25. The study obtained ethical clearance. Results: A total of 150 responses were analysed. The reliability of the Sindhi version of GMAS was (α) = 0.696. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was reported at 0.696 (95% CI: 0.618-0.763). The values for the fit indices were as follows: χ(2)/df = 1.84, GFI = 0.918, TLI = 0.920, CFI = 0.942, AGFI = 0.864, and RMSEA = 0.075. All values except AGFI were in the acceptable ranges and indicated good fitness. Most participants (80.7%) appeared non-adherent to their medications. Conclusion: The results of the study demonstrate that the Sindhi version of the GMAS is a valid and reliable scale to measure adherence in Sindhi speaking persons with chronic diseases.",2023,,Front Pharmacol,14,,1235032,,10.3389/fphar.2023.1235032,37799967,#868,Islam 2023,,,0
Aversion to Mesh Use in Pelvic Floor Surgery in a Latina Population at the U.S.-Mexico Border.,Florence E; Limtrakul N; Sanchez S; Montoya TI; Maldonado PA,"IMPORTANCE: Limited studies have examined patient aversion to mesh use in pelvic surgery, especially in Latinas. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess aversion to pelvic surgery with mesh for urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse in a sample of Latinas on the U.S.-Mexico border. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of self-identified Latinas with symptoms of pelvic floor disorders, recruited at their initial consultation visit at a single, academic urogynecology clinic. Participants completed a validated survey to assess perceptions of mesh use in pelvic surgery. Participants also completed questionnaires assessing the presence and severity of pelvic floor symptoms and level of acculturation. The primary outcome was aversion to mesh surgery, as indicated by a response of ""yes"" or ""maybe"" to the question ""Based on what you already know, would you avoid surgery using mesh?"" Descriptive analysis, univariate relative risk, and linear regression analysis were completed to identify characteristics associated with mesh avoidance. Significance was assessed and considered at P values <0.05. RESULTS: Ninety-six women were included. Only 6.3% had prior pelvic floor surgery using mesh. Sixty-six percent indicated that they would be likely to avoid pelvic surgery that uses mesh. Only 9.4% indicated that they obtained information regarding mesh directly from medical professionals. Levels of concern regarding the use of mesh varied widely (29.2% not worried, 19.1% somewhat worried, 16.9% very worried). Higher percentages of ""more acculturated"" participants indicated a desire to avoid mesh surgery (58.7% vs 27.3%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this Latina population, a majority of patients indicated an aversion to using mesh in pelvic surgery. Few patients obtained information regarding mesh directly from medical professionals, relying instead on nonmedical sources.",2024,Jan,Urogynecology (Phila),30,1,17-25,,10.1097/SPV.0000000000001375,37326237,#535,Florence 2024,,,0
Estimation of Intangible Costs for Factors Associated with Oral Antiviral Drugs for COVID-19 Treatment: A Conjoint Analysis in Japan.,Hosogaya N; Takazono T; Kurazono K; Hiroi S; Iwasaki K; Takeshima T; Ha C; Mukae H,"INTRODUCTION: During the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, preferences for factors associated with vaccines have been evaluated. Three oral antiviral drugs have been approved in Japan for patients with mild-to-moderate I COVID-19 symptoms. Although preferences for the drugs may also depend on various factors, these have not been fully evaluated. METHODS: A conjoint analysis was performed based on an online survey in August 2022 to estimate the intangible costs of factors associated with oral antiviral drugs for COVID-19. Respondents were individuals aged 20-69 across Japan. The attributes included the company (Japanese/foreign) that developed the drug, formulation and size of the drug, frequency of administration per day, number of tablets/capsules per dose, number of days until no longer infectious to others, and out-of-pocket expenses. A logistic regression model was applied to estimate the utility of each level for each attribute. The intangible costs were calculated by comparing the utility to the out-of-pocket attribute. RESULTS: Responses were collected from 11,303 participants. The difference between levels was the largest for companies that developed a drug; the intangible costs were JPY 5390 higher for the foreign company than for the Japanese company. The next largest difference was in the number of days until one is no longer infectious. For the same formulation, the intangible cost was lower for small sizes than large sizes. For similar-sized tablets and capsules, the intangible cost was lower for tablets than capsules. These tendencies were similar regardless of COVID-19 infection history and the presence of risk factors for severe COVID-19 in the respondents. CONCLUSION: Intangible costs for factors associated with oral antiviral drugs among the Japanese population were estimated. The results may change as the number of people with a history of COVID-19 infection increases and significant progress is made regarding treatments.",2023,Aug,Adv Ther,40,8,3525-3542,,10.1007/s12325-023-02564-4,37303032,#1011,Hosogaya 2023,,,1
"""But I Have a Pacer…There Is No Point in Engaging in Hypothetical Scenarios"": A Non-Imminently Dying Patient's Request for Pacemaker Deactivation.",Tracy BA; Rhodes R; Goldstein NE,"In this case report, we describe a woman with advancing dementia who still retained decisional capacity and was able to clearly articulate her request for deactivation of her implanted cardiac pacemaker-a scenario that would result in her death. In this case, the patient had the autonomy to make her decision, but clinicians at an outside hospital refused to deactivate her pacemaker even though they were in unanimous agreement that the patient had capacity to make this decision, citing personal discomfort and a belief that her decision seemed out of proportion to her suffering. We evaluated her at our hospital, found her to have decision-making capacity, and deactivated her pacer resulting in her death about 9 days later. While some clinicians may be comfortable discussing patient preferences for device deactivation in patients who are imminently dying, we can find no reports in the literature of requests for device deactivation from patients with terminal diagnoses who are not imminently dying.",2024,Feb,Camb Q Healthc Ethics,,,1-4,,10.1017/S096318012400001X,38327085,#381,Tracy 2024,,,0
Multidisciplinary consensus document on the current treatment of bacille Calmette-Guérin-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder tumor.,Guerrero-Ramos F; Álvarez-Maestro M; Pinto Marín Á; Domínguez Escrig JL; Rodríguez Faba Ó,"Radical cystectomy is the current treatment of choice for patients with BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder tumor (NMIBC). However, the high comorbidity of this surgery and its effects on the quality of life of patients require the investigation and implementation of bladder-sparing treatment options.

Early Pregnancy Loss Management in the Emergency Department vs Outpatient Setting.,Benson LS; Holt SK; Gore JL; Callegari LS; Chipman AK; Kessler L; Dalton VK,"IMPORTANCE: Early pregnancy loss (EPL), or miscarriage, is the most common complication of early pregnancy, and many patients experiencing EPL present to the emergency department (ED). Little is known about how patients who present to the ED with EPL differ from those who present to outpatient clinics and how their management and outcomes differ. OBJECTIVE: To compare the management and outcomes of patients with EPL who present to the ED vs outpatient clinics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used the IBM MarketScan Research Database, a national insurance claims database. Participants were pregnant people aged 15 to 49 years in the US who presented to either an ED or outpatient clinic for initial diagnosis of EPL from October 2015 through December 2019. Data analysis was performed from May 2021 to March 2022. EXPOSURES: The primary exposure was location of service (ED vs outpatient clinic). Other exposures of interest included demographic characteristics, current pregnancy history, and comorbidities. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was EPL management type (surgical, medication, or expectant management). Complications, including blood transfusion and hospitalization, and characteristics associated with location of service were also evaluated. Bivariable analyses and multivariable logistic regression were used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 117 749 patients with EPL diagnoses were identified, with a mean (SD) age of 31.8 (6.1) years. Of these patients, 20 826 (17.7%) initially presented to the ED, and 96 923 (82.3%) presented to outpatient clinics. Compared with the outpatient setting, patients in the ED were less likely to receive surgical (2925 patients [14.0%] vs 23 588 patients [24.3%]) or medication (1116 patients [5.4%] vs 10 878 patients [11.2%]) management. In the adjusted analysis, characteristics associated with decreased odds of active (surgical or medication) vs expectant management included ED (vs outpatient) presentation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.44-0.47), urban location (aOR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82-0.91), and being a dependent on an insurance policy (vs primary policy holder) (aOR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.67-0.74); whereas older age (aOR per 1-year increase 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.01), established prenatal care (aOR, 2.35; 95% CI, 2.29-2.42), and medical comorbidities (aOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09) were associated with increased odds of receiving active management. Patients in the ED were more likely than those in outpatient clinics to need a blood transfusion (287 patients [1.4%] vs 202 patients [0.2%]) or hospitalization (463 patients [2.2%] vs 472 patients [0.5%]), but complications were low regardless of location of service. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of privately insured patients with EPL, differences in management between the ED vs outpatient setting may reflect barriers to accessing comprehensive EPL management options. More research is needed to understand these significant differences in management approaches by practice setting, and to what extent EPL management reflects patient preferences in both outpatient and ED settings.",2023,Mar,JAMA Netw Open,6,3,e232639,,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.2639,36920395,#1428,Benson 2023,,,0
"A cross-sectional study evaluating the knowledge, attitude, and practice of evidence-based medicine among resident doctors of a health-care Institution of National Importance in India.",Prabath I; Xaviar S; Navabalan V; Mathaiyan J,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promotes the integration of updated- best evidence with patient preferences and medical expertise for clinical decision-making. Despite the availability of high-quality evidence such as systematic review and meta-analysis, some clinicians manage their patients based on past experiences and expert opinion. Thus, this study was proposed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of EBM among resident doctors at a tertiary care hospital in India. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted among senior residents and final-year postgraduates (PGs) who were independently involved in clinical decision-making. By convenience sampling method, the participants were recruited, and the validated EBM Questionnaire (EBMQ) was distributed online for assessing the knowledge, attitude, and practice of EBM. Descriptive statistics were represented as frequency and proportions. RESULTS: A total of 102 resident doctors participated with male preponderance (74.5%). Nearly, 96 (94.1%) participants were already practicing EBM and 21.6% had undergone EBM training. Textbooks (50%) were the most often referred sources for EBM information. Specific EBM databases such as MEDLINE and Cochrane were also utilized by 37.3% of participants. More than 70% of participants understood the terms such as a randomized controlled trial, case-control study, and P value. A higher proportion (80.4%) of participants showed a positive attitude about patient care improved by EBM. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the resident doctors exhibited good knowledge and a positive attitude toward applying EBM in clinical decision-making.

"Development of a Specific Variant of Patient Benefit Index (PBI) Assessing Patient Needs, Goals and Benefits in Rosacea Treatment.",Augustin M; Sommer R; Blome C; Kirsten N; Langenbruch A,"INTRODUCTION: Evaluation of patient-reported outcomes including health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and perceived benefits from treatment has become a fundamental component of medical decision-making. Standardized evaluation of treatment benefits in rosacea based on patient preferences is still lacking. OBJECTIVE: Development and validation of an instrument for recording patient-defined benefits in rosacea therapy based on the Patient Benefit Index (PBI) methodology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an open survey of n = 50 patients, potential benefits of therapy from the patient's perspective were examined. The generated item pool was combined with pre-existing PBI items for other skin conditions and reviewed by an expert panel of dermatologists, psychologists and patients. Items were condensed to n = 25 and converted into a Likert-scaled questionnaire. The validity and feasibility of the resulting Patient Benefit Index for rosacea (PBI-RO) were tested on individuals with rosacea recruited from a German rosacea patient organization. RESULTS: N = 446 patients with rosacea completed the PBI-RO. The internal consistencies measured by Cronbach's alpha were high (Patient Needs Questionnaire [PNQ] 0.94). Mean PBI-RO was 1.9 ± 1.2 (scale from 0 = no benefit to 4 = maximum benefit), 23.5% of the patients experienced a PBI-RO < 1 (no clinically relevant benefit). The PBI-RO correlated with HRQoL, health state, current extent of rosacea lesions and treatment satisfaction. The highest correlation was found between PBI-RO and satisfaction with previous treatment (r = -0.59, p < 0.001); correlation with the extent of rosacea lesions was low (r = 0.16, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The PBI-RO shows satisfying internal consistency and construct validity. It offers the option of a patient-weighted evaluation of the therapeutic benefit of rosacea therapy and may add to more stringent goal orientation in therapy.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,1335-1345,,10.2147/PPA.S378724,37284248,#1180,Augustin 2023,,,0
"Preferences for preventive treatments for rheumatoid arthritis: discrete choice survey in the UK, Germany and Romania.",Simons G; Veldwijk J; DiSantostefano RL; Englbrecht M; Radawski C; Bywall KS; Valor Méndez L; Hauber B; Raza K; Falahee M,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify preferences for preventive therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) across three countries. METHODS: A web-based survey including a discrete choice experiment was administered to adults recruited via survey panels in the UK, Germany and Romania. Participants were asked to assume they were experiencing arthralgia and had a 60% chance of developing RA in the next 2 years and completed 15 choices between no treatment and two hypothetical preventive treatments. Treatments were defined by six attributes (effectiveness, risks and frequency/route of administration) with varying levels. Participants also completed a choice task with fixed profiles reflecting subjective estimates of candidate preventive treatments. Latent class models (LCMs) were conducted and the relative importance of attributes, benefit-risk trade-offs and predicted treatment uptake was subsequently calculated. RESULTS: Completed surveys from 2959 participants were included in the analysis. Most participants preferred treatment over no treatment and valued treatment effectiveness to reduce risk more than other attributes. A five-class LCM best fitted the data. Country, perceived risk of RA, health literacy and numeracy predicted class membership probability. Overall, the maximum acceptable risk for a 40% reduction in the chance of getting RA (60% to 20%) was 21.7%, 19.1% and 2.2% for mild side effects, serious infection and serious side effects, respectively. Predicted uptake of profiles reflecting candidate prevention therapies differed across classes. CONCLUSION: Effective preventive pharmacological treatments for RA were acceptable to most participants.

Low Trend for VZV-Associated Disease Patients to Visit Neurologists.,Xu G; Xu S; Gong W; Dong S; Yu H,"BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster (HZ) is a skin disease that can also cause virus-infectious peripheral neuropathies. Despite this, there is limited information on patient preferences for seeking medical attention for HZ and zoster-associated pain (ZAP). Our study aimed to evaluate how frequently patients with ZAP choose to visit neurologists for their symptoms. METHODS: This study conducted a retrospective review of electronic health records in three general hospitals from January 2017 to June 2022. Using association rule mining, the study analyzed referral behaviors. RESULTS: We identified 33,633 patients with 111,488 outpatient visits over 5.5 years. The study found that the majority of patients (74.77-91.22%) visited dermatologists during their first outpatient visit, while only a small percentage (0.86-1.47%) preferred to consult a neurologist. The proportion of patients referred to a specialist during their medical visit varied significantly between different specialties within the same hospital (p <0.05) and even within the same specialty (p<0.05). There was a weak association (Lift:1.00-1.17) of referral behaviors between dermatology and neurology. Across the three hospitals, the average number of visits to a neurologist for ZAP was 1.42-2.49, with an average electronic health record duration of 11-15 days per patient. After consulting with a neurologist, some patients were referred to other specialists. CONCLUSION: It was observed that patients with HZ and ZAP tended to visit a variety of specialists, with only a small number seeking the assistance of neurologists. However, from the perspective of neuroprotection, it is the duty of neurologists to provide more means.",2023,,J Multidiscip Healthc,16,,1379-1392,,10.2147/JMDH.S412398,37215749,#1235,Xu 2023,,,0
Patient Preferences and Their Effects on Rehabilitation Outcomes: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,Agger N; Bøjstrup JN; Christiansen DH,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of aligning patients' preferences with specific rehabilitation delivery modes on rehabilitation outcomes. DESIGN: A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: The study cohort comprised 208 patients referred for physiotherapy rehabilitation after non-surgical or surgical interventions for rotator cuff injury, shoulder impingement, or acromioclavicular osteoarthritis. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three rehabilitation modalities: 1) group-based exercise, 2) individual exercise, or 3) home exercise. In this study, participants were categorized into two groups: ""matched preference"" (MP) and ""unmatched preference"" (UP). The primary outcome measure was change in function, measured with the shortened Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH). Secondary outcome measures were change in pain, assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), mental well-being measured with the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), health-related quality of life assessed using the EuroQol-5Domain questionnaire (EQ-5D), fear avoidance assessed using the Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire (ÖMPQ), and overall treatment satisfaction. Outcomes were assessed at 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: The primary outcome measure, QuickDASH, showed no significant differences between groups at either 3 months (-3.0 [-8.2 to 2.3]) or 6 months (0.5 [-5.7 to 6.7]). Additionally, no significant differences were observed in the secondary outcome measures. CONCLUSION: Matching patients' preferences for specific rehabilitation delivery modes did not seem to effect rehabilitation outcomes.",2024,Mar,J Orthop Sports Phys Ther,,,1-23,,10.2519/jospt.2024.12314,38530232,#208,Agger 2024,,,0

Factors Influencing Preferences of Patients With Rheumatic Diseases Regarding Telehealth Channels for Support With Medication Use: Qualitative Study.,Haegens LL; Huiskes VJB; van der Ven J; van den Bemt BJF; Bekker CL,"BACKGROUND: Patients with rheumatic diseases are known to experience drug-related problems at various times during their treatment. As these problems can negatively influence patients' health, they should be prevented or resolved as soon as possible, for which patients might benefit from additional support. Telehealth has the potential to continuously provide information and offers the possibility to easily contact a health care provider in order to support patients with medication use. Knowledge of factors influencing the patient's preference for telehealth channels can improve the actual use of telehealth channels. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify factors that influence the preferences of patients with rheumatic diseases regarding telehealth channels for support with medication use. METHODS: A qualitative study with face-to-face interviews was performed among patients with an inflammatory rheumatic disease in the Netherlands. A total of 4 telehealth channels were used: a frequently asked questions page, a digital human, an app for SMS text messaging with health care providers, and an app for video-calling with health care providers. Using a semistructured interview guide based on domains of the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior (COM-B) model, participants were questioned about (1) their general opinion on the 4 telehealth channels, (2) factors influencing preference for individual telehealth channels, and (3) factors influencing preference for individual telehealth channels in relation to the other available channels. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and categorically analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients were interviewed (female: n=8, 53%; male: n=7, 47%; mean age 55, SD 16.8 years; median treatment duration of 41, IQR 12-106 months). The following 3 categories of factors influencing patient preference regarding telehealth channels were identified: (1) problem-related factors included problems needing a visual check, problems specifically related to the patient, and urgency of the problem; (2) patient-related factors included personal communication preference and patient characteristics; and (3) channel-related factors included familiarity with the telehealth channel, direct communication with a health care provider, methods of searching, and conversation history. CONCLUSIONS: Preference for telehealth channels is influenced by factors related to the problem experienced, the patient experiencing the problem, and telehealth channel characteristics. As the preference for telehealth channels varies between these categories, multiple telehealth channels should be offered to enable patients to tailor the support with their medication use to their needs.",2023,Jul,JMIR Form Res,7,,e45086,,10.2196/45086,37471137,#1049,Haegens 2023,,,0
Guidelines on the prevention of foot ulcers in persons with diabetes (IWGDF 2023 update).,Bus SA; Sacco ICN; Monteiro-Soares M; Raspovic A; Paton J; Rasmussen A; Lavery LA; van Netten JJ,"AIMS: This is the 2023 International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot guideline on the prevention of foot ulcers in persons with diabetes, which updates the 2019 guideline. This guideline is targeted at clinicians and other healthcare professionals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology to devise clinical questions and critically important outcomes in the PICO format, to conduct a systematic review of the medical-scientific literature including, where appropriate, meta-analyses, and to write recommendations and their rationale. The recommendations are based on the quality of evidence found in the systematic review, expert opinion where (sufficient) evidence was not available, and a weighing of the desirable and undesirable effects of an intervention, as well as patient preferences, costs, equity, feasibility and applicability. RESULTS: We recommend screening a person with diabetes at very low risk of foot ulceration annually for the loss of protective sensation and peripheral artery disease, and screening persons at higher risk at higher frequencies for additional risk factors. For preventing a foot ulcer, educate persons at-risk about appropriate foot self-care, educate not to walk without suitable foot protection, and treat any pre-ulcerative lesion on the foot. Educate moderate-to-high risk people with diabetes to wear properly fitting, accommodative, therapeutic footwear, and consider coaching them to monitor foot skin temperature. Prescribe therapeutic footwear that has a demonstrated plantar pressure relieving effect during walking, to help prevent plantar foot ulcer recurrence. Consider advising people at low-to-moderate risk to undertake a, preferably supervised, foot-ankle exercise programme to reduce ulcer risk factors, and consider communicating that a total increase in weight-bearing activity of 1000 steps/day is likely safe with regards to risk of ulceration. In people with non-rigid hammertoe with pre-ulcerative lesion, consider flexor tendon tenotomy. We suggest not to use a nerve decompression procedure to help prevent foot ulcers. Provide integrated foot care for moderate-to-high-risk people with diabetes to help prevent (recurrence of) ulceration. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations should help healthcare professionals to provide better care for persons with diabetes at risk of foot ulceration, to increase the number of ulcer-free days and reduce the patient and healthcare burden of diabetes-related foot disease.",2024,Mar,Diabetes Metab Res Rev,40,3,e3651,,10.1002/dmrr.3651,37302121,#322,Bus 2024,,,0
Patients' Views on AI for Risk Prediction in Shared Decision-Making for Knee Replacement Surgery: Qualitative Interview Study.,Gould DJ; Dowsey MM; Glanville-Hearst M; Spelman T; Bailey JA; Choong PFM; Bunzli S,"BACKGROUND: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making around knee replacement surgery is increasing, and this technology holds promise to improve the prediction of patient outcomes. Ambiguity surrounds the definition of AI, and there are mixed views on its application in clinical settings. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to explore the understanding and attitudes of patients who underwent knee replacement surgery regarding AI in the context of risk prediction for shared clinical decision-making. METHODS: This qualitative study involved patients who underwent knee replacement surgery at a tertiary referral center for joint replacement surgery. The participants were selected based on their age and sex. Semistructured interviews explored the participants' understanding of AI and their opinions on its use in shared clinical decision-making. Data collection and reflexive thematic analyses were conducted concurrently. Recruitment continued until thematic saturation was achieved. RESULTS: Thematic saturation was achieved with 19 interviews and confirmed with 1 additional interview, resulting in 20 participants being interviewed (female participants: n=11, 55%; male participants: n=9, 45%; median age: 66 years). A total of 11 (55%) participants had a substantial postoperative complication. Three themes captured the participants' understanding of AI and their perceptions of its use in shared clinical decision-making. The theme Expectations captured the participants' views of themselves as individuals with the right to self-determination as they sought therapeutic solutions tailored to their circumstances, needs, and desires, including whether to use AI at all. The theme Empowerment highlighted the potential of AI to enable patients to develop realistic expectations and equip them with personalized risk information to discuss in shared decision-making conversations with the surgeon. The theme Partnership captured the importance of symbiosis between AI and clinicians because AI has varied levels of interpretability and understanding of human emotions and empathy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent knee replacement surgery in this study had varied levels of familiarity with AI and diverse conceptualizations of its definitions and capabilities. Educating patients about AI through nontechnical explanations and illustrative scenarios could help inform their decision to use it for risk prediction in the shared decision-making process with their surgeon. These findings could be used in the process of developing a questionnaire to ascertain the views of patients undergoing knee replacement surgery on the acceptability of AI in shared clinical decision-making. Future work could investigate the accuracy of this patient group's understanding of AI, beyond their familiarity with it, and how this influences their acceptance of its use. Surgeons may play a key role in finding a place for AI in the clinical setting as the uptake of this technology in health care continues to grow.",2023,Sep,J Med Internet Res,25,,e43632,,10.2196/43632,37721797,#873,Gould 2023,,,0

Adherence and Persistence to Nusinersen for Spinal Muscular Atrophy: A US Claims-Based Analysis.,Fox D; To TM; Seetasith A; Patel AM; Iannaccone ST,"INTRODUCTION: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic, neuromuscular disease caused by deletions and/or mutations in the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene leading to reduced SMN protein levels. Nusinersen, an intrathecally administered antisense oligonucleotide therapy that increases SMN protein levels, is approved for use in adult and pediatric patients with SMA. Data to inform real-world patient adherence and persistence to nusinersen are limited, with disparities in the population with SMA, study design, and results. The objective of this study is to characterize real-world nusinersen adherence and persistence in patients with SMA. METHODS: This retrospective study examined nusinersen adherence and persistence over a 2-year period in patients with SMA in the USA from the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus claims database. Patients were followed from the date of first evidence of nusinersen treatment (occurring after 1 July 2017) until the end of the study period (31 December 2019) or end of continuous pharmacy and medical benefit enrollment, whichever came first. Subgroup analyses for nusinersen adherence and persistence were performed on the basis of age and presence or absence of spinal complications. RESULTS: The final cohort consisted of 179 patients with SMA treated with nusinersen. Adherence to nusinersen treatment was 41% at 56 weeks and 39% at 104 weeks. In the base-case persistence analysis, there was a decrease in persistence before 6 months (67%) and further decline at 1 (57%) and 2 years (55%). Patients with spinal complication versus without had numerically higher persistence with nusinersen. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that adherence and persistence to nusinersen treatment appear low. Demographic (age ≥ 18 years) and clinical factors (no spinal complications) may contribute to nusinersen treatment discontinuation. Future research should explore possible reasons for low adherence and persistence to nusinersen treatment, such as clinical or logistical factors, patient preferences, and payer restrictions.",2023,Mar,Adv Ther,40,3,903-919,,10.1007/s12325-022-02376-y,36534265,#1468,Fox 2023,,,0
Older adult preferences regarding benefits and harms of statin and aspirin therapy for cardiovascular primary prevention.,Wang FM; Yebyo HG; Ballew SH; Cainzos-Achirica M; Boyd C; Puhan MA; Matsushita K; Blaha MJ; Schoenborn NL,"OBJECTIVE: Personalizing preventive therapies for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is particularly important for older adults, as they tend to have multiple chronic conditions, increased risk for medication adverse effects, and may have heterogenous preferences when weighing health outcomes. However, little is known about outcome preferences related to ASCVD preventive therapies in older adults. METHODS: In May 2021, using an established online panel, KnowledgePanel, we surveyed older US adults aged 65-84 years without history of ASCVD on outcome preferences related to statin therapy (benefit outcomes to be reduced by the therapy: heart attack, stroke; adverse effects: diabetes, abnormal liver test, muscle pain) or aspirin therapy (benefit outcomes: heart attack, stroke; adverse effects: brain bleed, bowel bleed, stomach ulcer). We used standardized best-worst scores (range of -1 for ""least worrisome"" to +1 for ""most worrisome"") and conditional logistic regression to examine the relative importance of the outcomes. RESULTS: In this study, 607 ASCVD-free participants (median age 74, 46% male, 81% White) were included; 304 and 303 completed the statin and aspirin versions of the survey, respectively. For statin-related outcomes, stroke and heart attack were most worrisome (score 0.55; 95% CI 0.51, 0.60) and (0.53; 0.48, 0.58), followed by potential harms of diabetes (-0.07; -0.10, -0.03), abnormal liver test (-0.25; -0.29, -0.20), and muscle pain (-0.77; -0.82, -0.73). For aspirin-related outcomes, stroke and heart attack were similarly most worrisome (0.48; 0.43, 0.52) and (0.43; 0.38, 0.48), followed by brain bleed (0.30; 0.25, 0.34), bowel bleed (-0.31; -0.33, -0.28), and stomach ulcer (-0.90; -0.92, -0.87). Conditional logistic regression and subgroup analyses by age, sex, and race yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults generally consider outcomes related to benefits of ASCVD primary preventive therapies-stroke and heart attack-more important than their adverse effects.

Development of a discrete choice experiment questionnaire to elicit preferences by pregnant women and policymakers for the expansion of non-invasive prenatal screening.,Nguyen HM; Lindsay C; Baradaran M; Guertin JR; Nshimyumukiza L; Soukkhaphone B; Reinharz D,"OBJECTIVE: An instrument for measuring intervention preferences applicable to both patients and policymakers would make it possible to better confront the needs of the supply and demand sides of the health care system. This study aimed to develop a discrete choice experiments (DCE) questionnaire to elicit the preferences of patients and policymakers. The instrument was specifically developed to estimate preferences for new conditions to be added to a screening program for fetal chromosomal anomalies. METHODS: A DCE development study was conducted. The methods employed included a literature review, a qualitative study (based on individual semi-structured interviews, consultations, and a focus group discussion) with pregnant women and policymakers, and a pilot project with 33 pregnant women to validate the first version of the instrument and test the feasibility of its administration. RESULTS: An initial list of 10 attributes was built based on a literature review and the qualitative research components of the study. Five attributes were built based on the responses provided by the participants from both groups. Eight attributes were consensually retained. A pilot project performed on 33 pregnant women led to a final instrument containing seven attributes: 'conditions to be screened', 'test performance', 'moment at gestational age to obtain the test result', 'degree of test result certainty to the severity of the disability', 'test sufficiency', 'information provided from test result', and 'cost related to the test'. CONCLUSION: It is possible to reach a consensus on the construction of a DCE instrument intended to be administered to pregnant women and policymakers. However, complete validation of the consensual instrument is limited because there are too few voting members of health technology assessment agencies committees to statistically ascertain the relevance of the attributes and their levels.",2023,,PLoS One,18,6,e0287653,,10.1371/journal.pone.0287653,37352239,#1151,Nguyen 2023,,,1
Attributes underlying patient choice of treatment modality for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion complicated by high-risk human papillomavirus infection.,He M; Jia R; Liu X; Su C; Qin Y; Li C; Jia Y,"OBJECTIVE: To use logistic regression to analyze the attributes underlying patients' treatment options for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) complicated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection, and identify the best benefit group of different treatment options. METHODS: Clinical data of 197 LSIL patients with HR-HPV infection between June 2009 and February 2022 were collected. According to the treatment options chosen by the patients, they were divided into the interferon, photodynamic therapy, follow-up observation, and focused ultrasound (FUS) treatment groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the influencing factors, including age, occupation, education level, maternity history, reason for encounter, route of consultation, annual personal and household income, screening for related risk factors, and identifying the best benefit group of different treatment options. RESULTS: One-way ANOVA revealed a statistically significant difference in age, education level, maternity history, reason for encounter, and annual household income (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed on these five factors, indicating that age ≤35 years, high school educational level or higher, and no childbirth history were independent risk factors influencing patients' choices of FUS treatment. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the age threshold of 31 years. CONCLUSION: Age, educational level, and maternity history were independent risk factors influencing patients' choice of treatment modality for LSIL complicated with HR-HPV infection. Age ≤31 years, high school, equivalent, or higher educational level, and no childbirth yielded a higher rate of choosing FUS treatment for LSIL patients with HR-HPV infection.",2023,,Int J Hyperthermia,40,1,2168075,,10.1080/02656736.2023.2168075,36683163,#1624,He 2023,,,0
Pharmacologic Treatment Strategies in Psoriatic Arthritis.,Ayan G; Ribeiro A; Macit B; Proft F,"PURPOSE: The goal of this narrative review was to provide current data on psoriatic arthritis (PsA) therapeutic strategies, supporting treatment decisions with a domain-based approach. METHODS: This narrative review of treatment strategies for PsA focused on several disease domains (ie, peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, axial disease, dactylitis, skin and nail disease), as well as the so-called ""related conditions"" of uveitis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, international guidelines, and recent congress abstracts. FINDINGS: Currently, multiple approved treatment options offer a wide range of options, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors; inhibitors of interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-12/23 (IL-12/23), IL-23 (IL-23), and Janus kinase; the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor apremilast; and the T-cell modulator abatacept. However, no treatment option shows clear superiority concerning efficacy on peripheral arthritis and dactylitis over the others, whereas limited evidence suggests that the IL-17 inhibitor ixekizumab and the IL-12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab may be superior to TNF inhibitors in treating enthesitis. Recent data on enthesitis have also shown promising results for methotrexate. Treatment of axial PsA is mostly derived from axial spondyloarthritis, and more data are needed focusing on this specific subgroup of PsA patients. Thus far, the most important finding from the only randomized controlled trial in this specific population is that the IL-17 inhibitor secukinumab was superior to placebo in terms of clinical and radiologic end-points in axial PsA. Regarding psoriatic skin involvement, head-to-head trials in PsA as well as skin psoriasis showed the superiority of IL-17, IL-23, and IL-12/23 inhibitors over TNF inhibitors. When treating PsA with concurrent uveitis, according to the existing data, monoclonal TNF inhibitor antibodies should be preferred. In PsA and concomitant inflammatory bowel disease, treatment decisions must include the consideration of which specific type of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) is present, as some of the agents either lack data or are ineffective in treating these 2 conditions. In both types, IL-17 inhibitors should be avoided. When determining treatment strategy, comorbidities should be carefully assessed, and the corresponding risk profile of the respective treatment modalities should be taken into consideration. IMPLICATIONS: There are many approved therapeutic options for treating patients with PsA, and additional emerging treatment options are in the pipeline. Individualized treatment decisions for each patient, depending on the leading disease phenotype, underlying comorbidities, and patient preferences, should be made based on shared decision-making.",2023,Sep,Clin Ther,45,9,826-840,,10.1016/j.clinthera.2023.05.010,37455227,#914,Ayan 2023,,,0

Patients accept therapy using embryonic stem cells for Parkinson's disease: a discrete choice experiment.,Bywall KS; Drevin J; Groothuis-Oudshoorn C; Veldwijk J; Nyholm D; Widner H; van Vliet T; Jiltsova E; Hansson M; Johansson JV,"BACKGROUND: New disease-modifying ways to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) may soon become a reality with intracerebral transplantation of cell products produced from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The aim of this study was to assess what factors influence preferences of patients with PD regarding stem-cell based therapies to treat PD in the future. METHODS: Patients with PD were invited to complete a web-based discrete choice experiment to assess the importance of the following attributes: (i) type of treatment, (ii) aim of treatment, (iii) available knowledge of the different types of treatments, (iv) effect on symptoms, and (v) risk for severe side effects. Latent class conditional logistic regression models were used to determine preference estimates and heterogeneity in respondents' preferences. RESULTS: A substantial difference in respondents' preferences was observed in three latent preference patterns (classes). ""Effect on symptoms"" was the most important attribute in class 1, closely followed by ""type of treatment,"" with medications as preferred to other treatment alternatives. Effect on symptoms was also the most important attribute in class 2, with treatment with hESCs preferred over other treatment alternatives. Likewise for class 3, that mainly focused on ""type of treatment"" in the decision-making. Respondents' class membership was influenced by their experience in treatment, side effects, and advanced treatment therapy as well as religious beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the respondents would accept a treatment with products emanating from hESCs, regardless of views on the moral status of embryos.

Previous systematic reviews supported evidence for favorable functional outcomes, but oncological outcomes were inconclusive owing to limited follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the real-world data on the mid- to long-term oncological and functional outcomes of whole-gland cryoablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in patients with clinically localized PCa, and to provide expert recommendations and commentary on these findings. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library publications through February 2022 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. As endpoints, baseline clinical characteristics, and oncological and functional outcomes were assessed. To estimate the pooled prevalence of oncological, functional, and toxicity outcomes, and to quantify and explain the heterogeneity, random-effect meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Twenty-nine studies were identified, including 14 on cryoablation and 15 on HIFU with a median follow-up of 72 mo. Most of the studies were retrospective (n = 23), with IDEAL (idea, development, exploration, assessment, and long-term study) stage 2b (n = 20) being most common. Biochemical recurrence-free survival, cancer-specific survival, overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and metastasis-free survival rates at 10 yr were 58%, 96%, 63%, 71-79%, and 84%, respectively. Erectile function was preserved in 37% of cases, and overall pad-free continence was achieved in 96% of cases, with a 1-yr rate of 97.4-98.8%. The rates of stricture, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, rectourethral fistula, and sepsis were observed to be 11%, 9.5%, 8%, 0.7%, and 0.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The mid- to long-term real-world data, and the safety profiles of cryoablation and HIFU are sound to support and be offered as primary treatment for appropriate patients with localized PCa. When compared with other existing treatment modalities for PCa, these ablative therapies provide nearly equivalent intermediate- to long-term oncological and toxicity outcomes, as well as excellent pad-free continence rates in the primary setting. This real-world clinical evidence provides long-term oncological and functional outcomes that enhance shared decision-making when balancing risks and expected outcomes that reflect patient preferences and values. PATIENT SUMMARY: Cryoablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound are minimally invasive treatments available to selectively treat localized prostate cancer, considering their nearly comparable intermediate- to long term cancer control and preservation of urinary continence to other radical treatments in the primary setting. However, a well-informed decision should be made based on one's values and preferences.",2023,Dec,Eur Urol,84,6,547-560,,10.1016/j.eururo.2023.06.013,37419773,#636,Deivasigamani 2023,,,0
"European Society of Endocrinology clinical practice guidelines on the management of adrenal incidentalomas, in collaboration with the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors.",Fassnacht M; Tsagarakis S; Terzolo M; Tabarin A; Sahdev A; Newell-Price J; Pelsma I; Marina L; Lorenz K; Bancos I; Arlt W; Dekkers OM,"Adrenal incidentalomas are adrenal masses detected on imaging performed for reasons other than suspected adrenal disease. In most cases, adrenal incidentalomas are nonfunctioning adrenocortical adenomas but may also require therapeutic intervention including that for adrenocortical carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, hormone-producing adenoma, or metastases. Here, we provide a revision of the first international, interdisciplinary guidelines on incidentalomas. We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system and updated systematic reviews on 4 predefined clinical questions crucial for the management of incidentalomas: (1) How to assess risk of malignancy?; (2) How to define and manage mild autonomous cortisol secretion?; (3) Who should have surgical treatment and how should it be performed?; and (4) What follow-up is indicated if the adrenal incidentaloma is not surgically removed? Selected Recommendations: (1) Each adrenal mass requires dedicated adrenal imaging. Recent advances now allow discrimination between risk categories: Homogeneous lesions with Hounsfield unit (HU) ≤ 10 on unenhanced CT are benign and do not require any additional imaging independent of size. All other patients should be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert meeting, but only lesions >4 cm that are inhomogeneous or have HU >20 have sufficiently high risk of malignancy that surgery will be the usual management of choice. (2) Every patient needs a thorough clinical and endocrine work-up to exclude hormone excess including the measurement of plasma or urinary metanephrines and a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (applying a cutoff value of serum cortisol ≤50 nmol/L [≤1.8 µg/dL]). Recent studies have provided evidence that most patients without clinical signs of overt Cushing's syndrome but serum cortisol levels post dexamethasone >50 nmol/L (>1.8 µg/dL) harbor increased risk of morbidity and mortality. For this condition, we propose the term ""mild autonomous cortisol secretion"" (MACS). (3) All patients with MACS should be screened for potential cortisol-related comorbidities that are potentially attributably to cortisol (eg, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus), to ensure these are appropriately treated. (4) In patients with MACS who also have relevant comorbidities surgical treatment should be considered in an individualized approach. (5) The appropriateness of surgical intervention should be guided by the likelihood of malignancy, the presence and degree of hormone excess, age, general health, and patient preference. We provide guidance on which surgical approach should be considered for adrenal masses with radiological findings suspicious of malignancy. (6) Surgery is not usually indicated in patients with an asymptomatic, nonfunctioning unilateral adrenal mass and obvious benign features on imaging studies. Furthermore, we offer recommendations for the follow-up of nonoperated patients, management of patients with bilateral incidentalomas, for patients with extra-adrenal malignancy and adrenal masses, and for young and elderly patients with adrenal incidentalomas. Finally, we suggest 10 important research questions for the future.",2023,Jul,Eur J Endocrinol,189,1,G1-G42,,10.1093/ejendo/lvad066,37318239,#1050,Fassnacht 2023,,,0
"Definitely, Maybe: Helping Patients Make Decisions about Surgery When Prognosis Is Uncertain.",Mitchell T; Abdelgadir J; Oshotse C; Ubel PA; Williamson T,"AbstractThe sudden onset of severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) is an event suffered by millions of individuals each year. Regardless of this frequency in occurrence, accurate prognostication remains difficult to achieve among physicians. There are many variables that affect this prognosis. Physicians are expected to assess the clinical indications of the brain injury while considering other factors such as patient quality of life, patient preferences, and environmental context. However, this lack of certainty in prognosis can ultimately affect treatment recommendations and prompt clinical ethical issues at the bedside, as it leaves room for physician bias and interpretation. In this article, we introduce data on neurosurgeon values that may shed light on the process physicians and patients involved in sTBI undergo. In doing so, we highlight the many nuances in decision-making for patients suffering from sTBI and discuss potential solutions to better patient-physician or surrogate-physician interactions.",2023,Summer,J Clin Ethics,34,2,169-174,,10.1086/724770,37229741,#1107,Mitchell 2023,,,0
Eliciting Depression Patients' Preferences for Medication Management: A Protocol for Discrete Choice Experiment.,Xie P; Li HQ; Peng WL; Yang H,"INTRODUCTION: Depression threatens people's lives and imposes huge economic burden. Antidepressant therapy is the first-line treatment for depression, and patient adherence to medication is the key to successful treatment. Depression patients have poor medication adherence, which leads to failure of depression management and significantly poorer clinical outcomes. Incorporating patient preferences into clinical decisions can improve uptake rates, optimize treatment adherence. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) can elicit and quantify individual preferences. Previous DCE studies were conducted in developed countries and ignored the influences of factors other than the medication. This paper outlines an ongoing DCE that aims to (1) explore medication-management-related characteristics that may affect depression patients' adherence to antidepressant, (2) elicit how depression patients consider the trade-offs among different medication managements. METHODS: The six attributes and their levels were developed through a literature review, semi-structured interviews and experts and focus group discussions. A fractional factorial design in the software Ngene 1.2 version was used to generate 36 choice sets, and they were divided into 3 blocks. A mixed logit model will be used to explore the patients' preferences, willingness to pay and uptake rate of depression patients for medication management attributes. RESULTS: The final questionnaire consists of three parts. The first is the introduction, which introduces the purpose of the study and the requirements of completing the questionnaire. This was followed by a general information questionnaire, which included sociodemographic characteristics. The last part is DCE tasks, which include 13 DCE choice sets, and each choice set include two alternative and one ""opt-out"" option. The pilot-test results showed the questionnaire was easy to understand and could be used in formal surveys. CONCLUSION: Our study shows how the development process of the study can be conducted and reported systematically and rigorously according to the theoretical foundation and design principles in DCE.",2024,,Patient Prefer Adherence,18,,289-300,,10.2147/PPA.S444800,38327728,#396,Xie 2024,,,1
"Birth plans: definitions, content, effects, and best practices.",Ghahremani T; Bailey K; Whittington J; Phillips AM; Spracher BN; Thomas S; Magann EF,"The first written guide for birth plans was introduced in 1980 as a means for birthing people to document their choices in the child birthing experience. The birth plan offers an opportunity for the patient and the provider to discuss the birthing process and determine how to safely accommodate patient preferences. Patient satisfaction with birthing plans is variable and may depend on how many requests they have, how many of their plans are accomplished, route of delivery, and whether complications arise during or after delivery. Unmet expectations may lead to posttraumatic stress disorder, but following a birth plan may also be protective against it. Birthing people who use a birth plan may be less likely to use epidural anesthesia, have early amniotomy, or use oxytocin. The first stage of labor may be longer when a birth plan is used; however, there does not seem to be a decrease in the length of the second stage of labor among patients with a birth plan. Some providers believe that a disadvantage of birth plans is disappointment when birth plans are not able to be followed, and others consider that birth plans interfere with professional autonomy.",2023,May,Am J Obstet Gynecol,228,5S,S977-S982,,10.1016/j.ajog.2022.12.011,37164502,#1264,Ghahremani 2023,,,0
Discrete Choice Experiment to Understand Japanese Patients' and Physicians' Preferences for Preventive Treatments for Migraine.,Seo J; Tervonen T; Ueda K; Zhang D; Danno D; Tockhorn-Heidenreich A,"INTRODUCTION: Self-injectable calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibody (mAb) auto-injectors and non-CGRP oral medications are currently available for migraine prevention in Japan. This study elicited the preferences for self-injectable CGRP mAbs and non-CGRP oral medications and determined differences in the relative importance of auto-injector attributes for patients and physicians in Japan. METHODS: Japanese adults with episodic (EM) or chronic (CM) migraine and physicians who treat migraine completed an online discrete choice experiment (DCE), asking participants to choose a hypothetical treatment they preferred between two self-injectable CGRP mAb auto-injectors and a non-CGRP oral medication. The treatments were described by seven treatment attributes, with attribute levels varying between questions. DCE data were analyzed using a random-constant logit model to estimate relative attribution importance (RAI) scores and predicted choice probabilities (PCP) of CGRP mAb profiles. RESULTS: A total of 601 patients (79.2% with EM, 60.1% female, mean age: 40.3 years) and 219 physicians (mean length of practice: 18.3 years) completed the DCE. About half (50.5%) of patients favored CGRP mAb auto-injectors, while others were skeptical of (20.2%) or averse (29.3%) to them. Patients most valued needle removal (RAI = 33.8%), shorter injection duration (RAI = 32.1%), and auto-injector base shape and need for skin pinching (RAI = 23.2%). Most physicians (87.8%) favored auto-injectors over non-CGRP oral medications. Physicians most valued less-frequent dosing RAI = 32.7%), shorter injection duration (30.4%), and longer storage outside the fridge (RAI = 20.3%). A profile comparable to galcanezumab showed a higher likelihood of being chosen by patients (PCP = 42.8%) than profiles comparable to erenumab (PCP = 28.4%) and fremanezumab (PCP = 28.8%). The PCPs of the three profiles were similar among physicians. CONCLUSION: Many patients and physicians preferred CGRP mAb auto-injectors over non-CGRP oral medications and preferred a treatment profile similar to galcanezumab. Our results may encourage physicians in Japan to consider patient preferences when recommending migraine preventive treatments.",2023,Apr,Neurol Ther,12,2,651-668,,10.1007/s40120-023-00453-0,36848008,#1357,Seo 2023,,,1

In this Society of Surgical Oncology position statement, we review the literature addressing the indications, risks, and benefits of CM since the society's 2017 statement. We held a virtual meeting to outline key topics and then conducted a literature search using PubMed to identify relevant articles. We reviewed the articles and made recommendations based on group consensus. Patients consider CM for many reasons, including concerns regarding the risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC), desire for improved cosmesis and symmetry, and preferences to avoid ongoing screening, whereas surgeons primarily consider CBC risk when making a recommendation for CM. For patients with a high risk of CBC, CM reduces the risk of new breast cancer, however it is not known to convey an overall survival benefit. Studies evaluating patient satisfaction with CM and reconstruction have yielded mixed results. Imaging with mammography within 12 months before CM is recommended, but routine preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging is not; there is also no evidence to support routine postmastectomy imaging surveillance. Because the likelihood of identifying an occult malignancy during CM is low, routine sentinel lymph node surgery is not recommended. Data on the rates of postoperative complications are conflicting, and such complications may not be directly related to CM. Adjuvant therapy delays due to complications have not been reported. Surgeons can reduce CM rates by encouraging shared decision making and informed discussions incorporating patient preferences.",2024,Apr,Ann Surg Oncol,31,4,2212-2223,,10.1245/s10434-024-14893-x,38261126,#191,Singh 2024,,,0
A Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Patients With Acute Spinal Cord Injury: Recommendations on Hemodynamic Management.,Kwon BK; Tetreault LA; Martin AR; Arnold PM; Marco RAW; Newcombe VFJ; Zipser CM; McKenna SL; Korupolu R; Neal CJ; Saigal R; Glass NE; Douglas S; Ganau M; Rahimi-Movaghar V; Harrop JS; Aarabi B; Wilson JR; Evaniew N; Skelly AC; Fehlings MG,"STUDY DESIGN: Clinical practice guideline development following the GRADE process. OBJECTIVES: Hemodynamic management is one of the only available treatment options that likely improves neurologic outcomes in patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Augmenting mean arterial pressure (MAP) aims to improve blood perfusion and oxygen delivery to the injured spinal cord in order to minimize secondary ischemic damage to neural tissue. The objective of this guideline was to update the 2013 AANS/CNS recommendations on the hemodynamic management of patients with acute traumatic SCI, acknowledging that much has been published in this area since its publication. Specifically, we sought to make recommendations on 1. The range of mean arterial pressure (MAP) to be maintained by identifying an upper and lower MAP limit; 2. The duration of such MAP augmentation; and 3. The choice of vasopressor. Additionally, we sought to make a recommendation on spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP) targets. METHODS: A multidisciplinary guideline development group (GDG) was formed that included health care professionals from a wide range of clinical specialities, patient advocates, and individuals living with SCI. The GDG reviewed the 2013 AANS/CNS guidelines and voted on whether each recommendation should be endorsed or updated. A systematic review of the literature, following PRISMA standards and registered in PROSPERO, was conducted to inform the guideline development process and address the following key questions: (i) what are the effects of goal-directed interventions to optimize spinal cord perfusion on extent of neurological recovery and rates of adverse events at any time point of follow-up? and (ii) what are the effects of particular monitoring techniques, perfusion ranges, pharmacological agents, and durations of treatment on extent of neurological recovery and rates of adverse events at any time point of follow-up? The GDG combined the information from this systematic review with their clinical expertise in order to develop recommendations on a MAP target range (specifically an upper and lower limit to target), the optimal duration for MAP augmentation, and the use of vasopressors or inotropes. Using methods outlined by the GRADE working group, recommendations were formulated that considered the balance of benefits and harms, financial impact, acceptability, feasibility and patient preferences. RESULTS: The GDG suggested that MAP should be augmented to at least 75-80 mmHg as the ""lower limit,"" but not actively augmented beyond an ""upper limit"" of 90-95 mmHg in order to optimize spinal cord perfusion in acute traumatic SCI. The quality of the evidence around the ""target MAP"" was very low, and thus the strength of this recommendation is weak. For duration of hemodynamic management, the GDG ""suggested"" that MAP be augmented for a duration of 3-7 days. Again, the quality of the evidence around the duration of MAP support was very low, and thus the strength of this recommendation is also weak. The GDG felt that a recommendation on the choice of vasopressor or the use of SCPP targets was not warranted, given the dearth of available evidence. CONCLUSION: We provide new recommendations for blood pressure management after acute SCI that acknowledge the limitations of the current evidence on the relationship between MAP and neurologic recovery. It was felt that the low quality of existing evidence and uncertainty around the relationship between MAP and neurologic recovery justified a greater range of MAP to target, and for a broader range of days post-injury than recommended in previous guidelines. While important knowledge gaps still remain regarding hemodynamic management, these recommendations represent current perspectives on the role of MAP augmentation for acute SCI.",2024,Mar,Global Spine J,14,3_suppl,187S-211S,,10.1177/21925682231202348,38526923,#271,Kwon 2024,,,0
Aortic Stenosis Phenotypes and Precision Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,Khawaja M; Virk HUH; Bandyopadhyay D; Rodriguez M; Escobar J; Alam M; Jneid H; Krittanawong C,"Patients with a clinical indication for aortic valve replacement can either undergo surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). There are many different factors that go into determining which type of replacement to undergo, including age, life expectancy, comorbidities, frailty, and patient preference. While both options offer significant benefits to patients in terms of clinical outcomes and quality of life, there is growing interest in expanding the indications for TAVI due to its minimally invasive approach. However, it is worth noting that there are several discrepancies in TAVI outcomes in regards to various endpoints, including death, stroke, and major cardiovascular events. It is unclear why these discrepancies exist, but potential explanations include the diversity of etiologies for aortic stenosis, complex patient comorbidities, and ongoing advancements in both medical therapies and devices. Of these possibilities, we propose that phenotypic variation of aortic stenosis has the most significant impact on post-TAVI clinical outcomes. Such variability in phenotypes is often due to a complex interplay between underlying comorbidities and environmental and inherent patient risk factors. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that patient genetics may also play a role in aortic stenosis pathology. As such, we propose that the selection and management of TAVI patients should emphasize a precision medicine approach.",2023,Jun,J Cardiovasc Dev Dis,10,7,,,10.3390/jcdd10070265,37504521,#1155,Khawaja 2023,,,0

See the Original Article here.

It is with great pleasure that we review the article, “Patient preferences and perceptions concerning aesthetic providers and social media,” by Murphrey et al.1 Social media is an enticing tool for physicians because it offers potential exposure to a broader audience than word of mouth or other traditional means of communication.2 In this study, the authors surveyed 2063 SurveyMonkey (San Mateo, CA) Audience participants about previous aesthetic procedures, demographic information, and perceptions of the social media of practicing physicians. An overwhelming majority (87%) felt before-and-after pictures were an important part of a practice's social media content. Two-thirds of respondents responded positively to seeing a practitioner's personal content on social media, and to a lesser degree, the majority of respondents (55%) preferred verification by a “blue check.”

The authors stated that their study was the first to analyze patient perceptions of aesthetic providers from social media content, although the senior author of this Commentary (H.J.F.) published a similar study in 2017.3 In that study, 100 consecutive patients from a single aesthetic practice were surveyed about their social media platform preference, their rating of 13 types of plastic surgery practice content, and their rating of 5 types of practice website content.3 Eighty percent of respondents said they were “interested” or “very interested” in before-and-after photographs, similar to the 87% cited in the current study. In addition, patients were equally interested in information about the practice (81%) and in contests offering a free treatment or product (80%). In a separate question about web content, before-and-after photographs won by a landslide: 50% of respondents chose them over 4 other choices. Although the 2 studies looked at very different cohorts 6 years apart, the vast majority of respondents in both agreed about before-and-after photographs.; ",,0
Variation in Hospital Neuraxial Labor Analgesia Rates in California.,Parameshwar P; Guo N; Bentley J; Main E; Singer SJ; Peden CJ; Morris T; Ansari J; Butwick AJ,"BACKGROUND: Neuraxial analgesia provides effective pain relief during labor. However, it is unclear whether neuraxial analgesia prevalence differs across US hospitals. Our aim was to assess hospital variation in neuraxial analgesia prevalence in California. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed birthing patients who underwent labor in 200 California hospitals from 2016 to 2020. The primary exposure was the delivery hospital. The outcomes were hospital neuraxial analgesia prevalence and between-hospital variability, before and after adjustment for patient and hospital factors. Median odds ratio and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) quantified between-hospital variability. The median odds ratio estimated the odds of a patient receiving neuraxial analgesia when moving between hospitals. The ICC quantified the proportion of the total variance in neuraxial analgesia use due to variation between hospitals. RESULTS: Among 1,510,750 patients who underwent labor, 1,040, 483 (68.9%) received neuraxial analgesia. Both unadjusted and adjusted hospital prevalence exhibited a skewed distribution characterized by a long-left tail. The unadjusted and adjusted prevalence at the 1 st percentile were 5.4% and 6.0%; 5 th percentile were 21.0% and 21.2%; 50 th percentile were 70.6% and 70.7%; 95 th percentile were 75.8% and 76.6%; and 99 th percentile were 75.9% and 78.6%. The adjusted median odds ratio (2.3; 95% CI, 2.1 - 2.5) indicated a substantially increased odds of a patient receiving neuraxial analgesia if they moved from a hospital with a lower to higher odds of neuraxial analgesia. The hospital explained only a moderate portion of the overall variability in neuraxial analgesia (ICC=19.1%; 95% CI, 18.8 - 20.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A long left tail in the distribution and wide variation exist in the neuraxial analgesia prevalence across California hospitals, not explained by patient and hospital factors. Addressing the low prevalence among hospitals in the left tail requires exploration of the interplay between patient preferences, staffing availability, and care providers' attitudes towards neuraxial analgesia.",2024,Feb,Anesthesiology,,,,,10.1097/ALN.0000000000004961,38412054,#337,Parameshwar 2024,,,0
Patient evaluation of gynaecological information provision and preferences.,Williams N; Griffin G; Wall M; Watson S; Warland J; Bradfield Z,"AIM: To evaluate gynaecological patients' preferences and satisfaction regarding information provision, exploring enablers and barriers to information access. DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional survey design was used. METHODS: A total of 293 women accessing gynaecological services responded to the survey. Quantitative analysis included descriptive and inferential statistics. Content analysis was conducted on qualitative data. RESULTS: Health professionals were the most common and preferred sources of gynaecological health information. Enablers to information provision included positive communication strategies by health professionals, participants having prior knowledge and doing their own research. Despite its widespread availability, only 24.2% of women preferred the internet as an information source. Poor communication and inadequate information provision were identified as barriers to information access. Statistically significant associations were identified between location of residence, education level, year of birth, diagnostic group and health information preferences. Recommendations from women included improved communication strategies, system changes and provision of individualized information. CONCLUSION: Health professionals are central to women accessing information about gynaecological diagnoses. Areas for improvement include communication strategies, facilitating access to internet-based resources for information and consideration of women's preferences when providing health information. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND PATIENT CARE: Consumer co-design of gynaecological health information and communication training for health professionals is recommended. Improved communication and facilitated use of internet-based resources may improve women's understanding of information. IMPACT: This study explored gynaecological patients' preferences and satisfaction regarding information provision, exploring enablers and barriers to information access. It was found that gynaecological patients preferred individualized information provided to them directly by health professionals and despite its widespread availability, the internet is an underutilized health information resource. These findings are applicable to health professionals and patients utilizing tertiary gynaecological health services in Australia but may be generalized if demographic data aligns with other jurisdictions. REPORTING METHOD: The STROBE reporting method was used in the preparation of the manuscript.

[Patient Preferences for Exercise Therapy in People with Severe Mental Illness in Germany].,Richter D; Riedel-Heller S; Breilmann J; Hasan A; Falkai P; Kilian R; Allgoewer A; Ajayi K; Baumgaertner J; Brieger P; Frasch K; Heres S; Jäger M; Küthmann A; Putzhammer A; Schneeweiß B; Schwarz M; Becker T; Kösters M; Gühne U,"PURPOSE: Assessing the experience with and the attitudes towards exercise therapy in persons with severe mental illness (SMI). Furthermore, potential variables of high preference towards exercise therapy are investigated. METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study of SMI patients aged between 18 and 65 years (n=385). Patients were interviewed by trained staff using standardised instruments. Potential variables were analysed using a hierarchic binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: 84,4% of SMI patients had a high preference for exercise therapy; of these, 44,1% exercised regularly. Among patients with severe mental illness especially a higher value in the GAF-assessment (p=0,041) and living in a metropolitan area (p=0,011) predict a high preference for exercise therapy. CONCLUSION: Most of the patients with severe mental illness interviewed in this study place a surprisingly high value on sports and exercise therapy. Due to the increasing evidence with regard to positive effects of these therapies, it may be an excellent starting point to expand sports and exercise therapy as part of a comprehensive treatment plan.

Preferences for Enhanced Primary Care Services Among Older Individuals and Primary Care Physicians.,Ozdemir S; Ansah J; Matchar D,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the factors that are most important for community-dwelling older individuals (i.e., users) and primary care (PC) providers to enhance PC services. METHODS: Discrete choice experiment surveys were administered to 747 individuals aged ≥ 60 years and 242 PC physicians in Singapore between December 2020 and August 2021. Participants were asked to choose between two hypothetical PC clinics and their current clinic. Latent class models were used to estimate the relative attribute importance (RAI) and to calculate the predicted uptake for enhanced PC services. RESULTS: Based on the attributes and levels used in this study, the out-of-pocket cost (RAI: 47%) and types of services offered (RAI: 25%) were the most important attributes for users while working hours (RAI: 28%) and patient load (RAI: 25%) were the most important for providers. For out-of-pocket visit costs ranging from Singapore dollars (S)$100 to S$5, users' predicted uptake for enhanced PC services ranged from 46 to 84%. For daily patient loads ranging from 60 to 20 patients, providers' predicted uptake ranged from 64 to 91%, assuming their income remains unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides timely insights for the development of strategies to support the government's new health care initiative (HealthierSG), which places PC at the center of Singapore's healthcare system. The ability to choose their preferred clinic, low out-of-pocket costs and types of services offered (for users), and reasonable working conditions (for providers) were the key factors for users and providers to participate in enhanced PC services.",2023,Sep,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,21,5,785-797,,10.1007/s40258-023-00809-5,37160566,#941,Ozdemir 2023,,,1
"Protocol of the Comparison of Intravesical Therapy and Surgery as Treatment Options (CISTO) study: a pragmatic, prospective multicenter observational cohort study of recurrent high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.",Gore JL; Wolff EM; Comstock BA; Follmer KM; Nash MG; Basu A; Chisolm S; MacLean DB; Lee JR; Lotan Y; Porten SP; Steinberg GD; Chang SS; Gilbert SM; Kessler LG; Smith AB,"BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer poses a significant public health burden, with high recurrence and progression rates in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Current treatment options include bladder-sparing therapies (BST) and radical cystectomy, both with associated risks and benefits. However, evidence supporting optimal management decisions for patients with recurrent high-grade NMIBC remains limited, leading to uncertainty for patients and clinicians. The CISTO (Comparison of Intravesical Therapy and Surgery as Treatment Options) Study aims to address this critical knowledge gap by comparing outcomes between patients undergoing BST and radical cystectomy. METHODS: The CISTO Study is a pragmatic, prospective observational cohort trial across 36 academic and community urology practices in the US. The study will enroll 572 patients with a diagnosis of recurrent high-grade NMIBC who select management with either BST or radical cystectomy. The primary outcome is health-related quality of life (QOL) at 12 months as measured with the EORTC-QLQ-C30. Secondary outcomes include bladder cancer-specific QOL, progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and financial toxicity. The study will also assess patient preferences for treatment outcomes. Statistical analyses will employ targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) to address treatment selection bias and confounding by indication. DISCUSSION: The CISTO Study is powered to detect clinically important differences in QOL and cancer-specific survival between the two treatment approaches. By including a diverse patient population, the study also aims to assess outcomes across the following patient characteristics: age, gender, race, burden of comorbid health conditions, cancer severity, caregiver status, social determinants of health, and rurality. Treatment outcomes may also vary by patient preferences, health literacy, and baseline QOL. The CISTO Study will fill a crucial evidence gap in the management of recurrent high-grade NMIBC, providing evidence-based guidance for patients and clinicians in choosing between BST and radical cystectomy. The CISTO study will provide an evidence-based approach to identifying the right treatment for the right patient at the right time in the challenging clinical setting of recurrent high-grade NMIBC.

"""It's That They Treated Me Like an Object"": A Qualitative Study on the Participation of People Diagnosed with Psychotic Disorders in Their Health Care.",Villena-Jimena A; Morales-Asencio JM; Quemada C; Hurtado MM,"The mental health recovery model is based on shared decision making, in which patients' preferences and perceptions of the care received are taken into account. However, persons with psychosis usually have very few opportunities to participate in this process. The present study explores the experiences and perceptions of a group of patients with psychosis-in some cases longstanding, in others more recently diagnosed-concerning their participation in the decisions taken about the approach to their condition and about the attention received from healthcare professionals and services. For this purpose, we performed a qualitative analysis of the outcomes derived from five focus groups and six in-depth interviews (36 participants). Two major themes, with five sub-themes, were identified: shared decision-making (drug-centred approach, negotiation process, and lack of information) and the care environment and styles of clinical practice as determinants (aggressive versus person-centred environments, and styles of professional practice). The main conclusions drawn are that users want to participate more in decision making, they want to be offered a range of psychosocial options from the outset and that their treatment should be based on accessibility, humanity and respect. These findings are in line with the guidelines for clinical practice and should be taken into account in the design of care programmes and the organisation of services for persons with psychosis.",2023,Mar,Int J Environ Res Public Health,20,5,,,10.3390/ijerph20054614,36901624,#1419,Villena-Jimena 2023,,,0
Acceptability and Feasibility of a Patient-Oriented Music Intervention to Reduce Pain in the Intensive Care Unit: Protocol for a Crossover Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,Richard-Lalonde M; Feeley N; Cossette S; Chlan LL; Gélinas C,"BACKGROUND: Many patients experience pain in the intensive care unit (ICU) despite receiving pain medication. Research has shown that music can help reduce pain. Music interventions studied so far have not used music streaming to generate playlists based on patient preferences while incorporating recommended tempo and duration. Previous research has focused on postoperative ICU patients able to self-report, which is underrepresentative of the ICU population that might benefit from a music intervention for pain management. We developed a new patient-oriented music intervention (POMI) that incorporates features based on theoretical, empirical, and experiential data intended to be used in the ICU. Such a music intervention should consider the expertise of ICU patients, family members, and nursing staff, as well as the practicality of the intervention when used in practice. OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this study are to (1) evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the POMI to reduce pain in ICU patients and (2) evaluate the feasibility of conducting a crossover pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) for intervention testing in the ICU. A secondary objective is to examine the preliminary efficacy of the POMI to reduce pain in ICU patients. METHODS: A single-blind 2×2 crossover pilot RCT will be conducted. Patients will undergo 1 sequence of 2 interventions: the POMI which delivers music based on patients' preferences via headphones or music pillow for 20-30 minutes and the control intervention (headphones or pillow without music). The sequence of the interventions will be inverted with a 4-hour washout period. Timing of the interventions will be before a planned bed turning procedure. Each patient will undergo 1 session of music. Twenty-four patients will be recruited. Patients able to self-report (n=12), family members of patients unable to self-report (n=12), and nursing staff (n=12) involved in the bed turning procedure will be invited to complete a short questionnaire on the POMI acceptability. Data will be collected on the feasibility of the intervention delivery (ie, time spent creating a playlist, any issue related to headphones/pillow or music delivery, environmental noises, and intervention interruptions) and research methods (ie, number of patients screened, recruited, randomized, and included in the analysis). Pain scores will be obtained before and after intervention delivery. RESULTS: Recruitment and data collection began in March 2022. As of July 5, 2022, in total, 22 patients, 12 family members, and 11 nurses were recruited. CONCLUSIONS: Methodological limitations and strengths are discussed. Study limitations include the lack of blinding for patients able to self-report. Strengths include collecting data from various sources, getting a comprehensive evaluation of the intervention, and using a crossover pilot RCT design, where participants act as their own control, thus reducing confounding factors.

This paper seeks to provide an exhaustive overview of the etiology, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and management strategies for these congenital lesions. Unilateral facial hyperpigmented lesions can be caused by a number of conditions, such as congenital melanocytic nevi, Becker's nevus, nevus of Ota, linear epidermal nevi, and café-au-lait macules. Accurate diagnosis requires meticulous examination, dermoscopy, and histopathological evaluation. Observation, topical therapies, surgical excision, and laser therapy are among the available treatment options. Treatment decisions should be influenced by factors such as lesion characteristics, aesthetic concerns, and patient preferences. Long-term supervision and psychosocial support are indispensable elements of comprehensive management. We present a case of a 12-year-old patient with a progressively growing hyperpigmented lesion on the right side of the face, present since birth with an intermittent area of normal skin in between. Dermoscopy unveiled an irregular, dark brown pigment network, and histopathological evaluation showed an increased number of melanocytes in the dermis. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of such lesions and underscores the significance of a multidisciplinary approach for accurate evaluation and management. This paper aims to cover existing knowledge gaps regarding unilateral facial hyperpigmented lesions since birth and direct future research efforts for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.",2023,Oct,Cureus,15,10,e47901,,10.7759/cureus.47901,38034188,#760,Dalave 2023,,,0
Values Assessment Tools in Advanced Cancer: A Clinical Literature Review.,Durbin Weaver S; Singh S; Sharpe LM; Reuland DS; Coombs LA,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced cancer may receive cancer treatment that does not reflect their values because they may not be completely aware of what is important to them regarding treatment-related decisions when they are diagnosed. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review was to determine whether existing values assessment tools can improve awareness of treatment-related decisional values in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: PubMed®, CINAHL®, and PsycINFO® databases were searched for original English-language articles evaluating values assessment tools that could be used to assess patients with advanced cancer. The quality of the identified tools was evaluated using selected International Patient Decision Aid Standards instrument, version 3.0, criteria. FINDINGS: All tools identified are appropriate for use in patients with advanced cancer. Two scored at least 80% on the selected International Patient Decision Aid Standards criteria. The Short Graphic Values History Tool was developed with patient and clinician input and may be particularly useful for low-literacy patient populations with advanced cancer. No values assessment tools have been identified specifically for use in patients with advanced cancer.",2023,Sep,Clin J Oncol Nurs,27,5,525-531,,10.1188/23.CJON.525-531,37729449,#874,DurbinWeaver 2023,,,0
The impact of adding platelet-rich plasma during fat graft myringoplasty for managing medium-sized tympanic membrane perforations: A prospective randomized case-control study.,Mandour MF; Elsheikh MN; Amer M; Elzayat S; Barbara M; Covelli E; Elfarargy HH; Tomoum M,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of adding platelet-rich plasma (PRP) during FGM to close medium-sized TM perforations. METHODS: This prospective randomized case-control study was conducted from February 2017 to March 2022. We included 320 patients with a medium-sized TM perforation with inactive mucosal otitis media. Transcanal FGM managed all patients under general or local anesthesia according to the patient preference. According to PRP, patients were divided into two groups: the first with PRP (170 patients) and the other without PRP (150 patients). We evaluated the closure rate of both groups one month, six months, and one year after the surgery. Also, we assessed the audiological performance before and one year after the operation for the patients with a successful closure. RESULTS: The closure rate was 87.6 % in the first group and 72.7 % in the second group, with a statistically significant difference between both groups as the P-value, was 0.001. Successful closure of the ABG to <10 dB occurred in 95.3 % of group A and 90.8 % of group B without a statistically significant difference between both groups (P-value = 0.163). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective comparative study on a relatively large number of patients revealed that FGM effectively closed medium-sized TM perforations. It also significantly improved postoperative audiological performance in both groups. Adding PRP during the FGM enhanced the closure success and the healing process without recorded complications. We recommend using the PRP in the routine FGM for closing medium-sized TM perforations.",2023,Mar-Apr,Am J Otolaryngol,44,2,103755,,10.1016/j.amjoto.2022.103755,36580741,#1463,Mandour 2023,,,0
Interest in advance provision of abortion pills: a national survey of potential users in the USA.,Lerma K; Blumenthal PD,"OBJECTIVE: To assess interest in clinician-administered advance provision of abortion pills among potential users in the USA. METHODS: Using social media advertisements, we recruited people living in the USA who were aged 18-45 years and assigned female at birth, who were not pregnant or planning pregnancy, for an online survey on reproductive health experiences and attitudes. We explored interest in advance provision of abortion pills, participant characteristics, including demographics and pregnancy history, contraceptive use, abortion knowledge and comfort, and healthcare system distrust. We used descriptive statistics to assess interest in advance provision, and ordinal regression modelling to evaluate differences in interest controlling for age, pregnancy history, contraceptive use, familiarity and comfort with medication abortion, and healthcare system distrust, reporting adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: From January-February 2022, we recruited 634 diverse respondents from 48 states, among whom 65% were interested, 12% neutral, and 23% disinterested in advance provision. There were no differences among interest groups by US region, race/ethnicity, or income. In the model, variables associated with interest included being aged 18-24 years (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.4) versus 35-45 years, using a tier 1 (permanent or long-acting reversible) or tier 2 (short-acting hormonal) contraceptive method (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.1, and aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.9, respectively) versus no contraception, being familiar or comfortable with the medication abortion process (aOR 4.2, 95% CI 2.8 to 6.2, and aOR 17.1, 95% CI 10.0 to 29.0, respectively), and having high healthcare system distrust (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.4) versus low distrust. CONCLUSION: As abortion access becomes more constrained, strategies are needed to ensure timely access. Advance provision is of interest to the majority of those surveyed and warrants further policy and logistical exploration.",2023,Jul,BMJ Sex Reprod Health,49,3,183-191,,10.1136/bmjsrh-2022-201775,36882325,#1132,Lerma 2023,,,0
Understanding patient preferences for student clinician attire: a cross-sectional study of a student chiropractic clinic in Australia.,Théroux J; Rogers C; Moyle R; Atwood I; Bebic M; Murfit S; Martin R; Klee S; Even T; Moore A; Willmott Z; McCartney K; Cascioli V; Blanchette MA; Beynon A,"OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have investigated the role of clinical attire in establishing patient-held perceptions of professionalism and knowledgeability across various healthcare settings. This study aimed to understand patients' preferences for chiropractic student attire. METHODS: Three hundred and twenty patients were recruited from a university chiropractic clinic and asked to complete an online questionnaire. The patients' preferences for five different attires were rated and calculated as the composite score of five domains (knowledgeable, trustworthy, caring, professional, and comfortable). RESULTS: While 71.9% of participants indicated that how students dress was important to them, most (63.4%) disagreed that wearing a white coat was essential for chiropractic student clinicians. The most preferred form of attire was the current clinic shirt. CONCLUSION: The attire worn by chiropractic student clinicians at a single institution was found to be an influential attribute. Student chiropractic clinicians should dress professionally to make a good first impression. This study provided some guidance with the ongoing debate around students' dress code.",2023,Aug,J Can Chiropr Assoc,67,2,127-141,,,37840583,#994,Théroux 2023,,,0
Is there a role for biomarkers in asymptomatic severe chronic primary mitral regurgitation?,Verma R; Bisleri G; Ong G; Connelly KA,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common heart valve disease with a rising prevalence with the aging populations worldwide. The timing of surgical intervention in patients who have severe MR but remain asymptomatic is often debated. Herein we synthesize the latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and European Society of Cardiology/ European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (ESC/EACTS) heart valve guidelines in such patients and illustrate how circulating and/or imaging biomarkers can be used to help refine decision making algorithms. RECENT FINDINGS: The approach to decision making and strength of guideline recommendations in patients with asymptomatic stage C1 (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] > 60% and left ventricular end systolic dimension [LVESD] < 40 mm) and stage C2 disease (LVEF ≤ 60% and/or LVESD ≥ 40 mm) are reviewed. While surgical intervention is clearly indicated in patients with stage C2 disease, a multifaceted approach that integrates repairability, expertise, sub-clinical evidence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and patient preferences is required to identify the optimal approach to surveillance vs. surgery. The role of imaging (3D echocardiography, contrast echocardiography, left ventricular global longitudinal strain, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging [CMR]) and circulating (natriuretic peptides) biomarkers in decision making is also reviewed. SUMMARY: The decision making around timing of intervention in chronic primary MR requires a personalized approach that is based on accurate assessments of severity of MR, LV dimensions, LV function, valve morphology/repairability, surgeon and center expertise, and patient wishes. Biomarkers hold promise in refining decision making.",2023,Mar,Curr Opin Cardiol,38,2,68-74,,10.1097/HCO.0000000000001016,36633320,#1457,Verma 2023,,,0
Preferences for Palliative and End-of-Life Care: A Systematic Review of Discrete Choice Experiments.,Xia Q; Kularatna M; Virdun C; Button E; Close E; Carter HE,"OBJECTIVES: Understanding what matters most to patients and their caregivers is fundamental to delivering high-quality care. This systematic review aimed to characterize and appraise the evidence from discrete choice experiments eliciting preferences for palliative care. METHODS: A systematic literature search was undertaken for publications up until August 2022. Data were synthesized narratively. Thematic analysis was applied to categorize attributes into groups. Attribute development, frequency, and relative importance were analyzed. Subgroup analyses were conducted to compare outcomes between patient and proxy respondents. RESULTS: Seventeen studies spanning 11 countries were included; 59% of studies solely considered preferences for patients with cancer. A range of respondent groups were represented including patients (76%) and proxies (caregivers [35%], health providers [12%], and the public [18%]). A total of 117 individual attributes were extracted and thematically grouped into 8 broad categories and 21 subcategories. Clinical outcomes including quality of life, length of life, and pain control were the most frequently reported attributes, whereas attributes relating to psychosocial components were largely absent. Both patients and proxy respondents prioritized pain control over additional survival time. Nevertheless, there were differences between respondent cohorts in the emphasis on other attributes such as access to care, timely information, and low risk of adverse effects (prioritized by patients), as opposed to cost, quality, and delivery of care (prioritized by proxies). CONCLUSIONS: Our review underscores the vital role of pain control in palliative care; in addition, it shed light on the complexity and relative strength of preferences for various aspects of care from multiple perspectives, which is useful in developing personalized, patient-centered models of care for individuals nearing the end of life.",2023,Dec,Value Health,26,12,1795-1809,,10.1016/j.jval.2023.07.005,37543206,#632,Xia 2023,,,1
Establishing a Pulmonary Nodule Clinic Service for Early Diagnosis of Lung Cancer - Review of International Options and Considerations for Greece.,Souliotis K; Golna C; Golnas P,"Early diagnosis of lung cancer in pulmonary nodules identified by computed tomography (CT) may be critical in reducing the epidemiological burden of the disease, particularly in countries where such a burden is considerably high and risk factors for lung cancer very prevalent. The establishment and operation of pulmonary nodule clinics (PNCs), ie, multidisciplinary services that watch and evaluate nodules found through deliberate screening efforts or as incidental findings, is increasingly becoming a key tool to implement such early-intervention, cancer-risk management policies elsewhere in the world. This review aims to research and present in a structured manner findings from published sources on options and considerations for setting up a PNC in a country such as Greece. These refer to the type of services a PNC would provide to optimize diagnosis of suspect pulmonary nodules, its structure and organization, including processes, human resources and technology infrastructure, its target audience, ie, who would be eligible to use its services, and the expected outcomes of its operation, in terms of a set of key performance indicators. Our review also revealed critical key success factors that should be considered when designing the introduction of a PNC in a health care setting, including optimal referral pathways, aligned clinical decision making and patient preferences and participation/empowerment. Our findings may inform health care systems with a high lung cancer burden and no available PNC service on options and considerations before introducing such a service in their respective settings.",2023,,Risk Manag Healthc Policy,16,,159-168,,10.2147/RMHP.S379014,36777476,#1523,Souliotis 2023,,,0
"Feasibility, Effectiveness and Safety of Elastomeric Pumps for Delivery of Antibiotics to Adult Hospital Inpatients-A Systematic Review.",Spencer-Jones J; Luxton T; Bond SE; Sandoe J,"Elastomeric infusion pumps (EMPs) have been implemented in many fields, including analgesia, chemotherapy and cardiology. Their application in antimicrobials is mainly limited to the outpatient setting, but with a need to optimise inpatient antimicrobial treatment, the use of EMPs presents a potential option. This review aimed to identify if the use of EMPs within an inpatient setting is feasible, effective and safe for antimicrobial use. Criteria for inclusion were human studies that involved the treatment of an infection with intravenous antimicrobial agents via an EMP. A search strategy was developed covering both the indexed and grey literature, with all study designs included. The review found 1 eligible study enrolling 6 patients. There was strong patient preference for EMPs (6/6), and daily tasks were easily completed whilst attached to the EMP. Nurses (5/5) also preffered the pumps, and the majority reported them as easy to use. The review has identified the need for further research in the area. Evidence for the use of EMPs to administer antibiotics in the inpatient setting is scarce, and more work is needed to understand the advantages to patients, to healthcare workers and from an antimicrobial stewardship perspective. Potential disadvantages that may put patients at risk also need investigating.",2023,Aug,Antibiotics (Basel),12,9,,,10.3390/antibiotics12091351,37760648,#969,Spencer-Jones 2023,,,0
The work of Chinese chronic conditions: adaptation and validation of the Distribution of Co-Care Activities Scale.,Zhou M; Liu M; Lu Q; Hou B; Yuan Y; Pan S; Zhang H,"PURPOSE: The Distribution of Co-Care Activities Scale was adapted into Chinese for the purposes of this study, and then the psychometric characteristics of the Chinese version of the DoCCA scale were confirmed in chronic conditions. METHODS: A total of 434 patients with chronic diseases were recruited from three Chinese cities. A cross-cultural adaptation procedure was used to translate the Distribution of Co-Care Activities Scale into Chinese. Cronbach's alpha coefficient, split-half reliability, and test-retest reliability were used to verify the scale's reliability. Content validity indices, exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis were used to confirm the scale's validity. RESULTS: The Chinese DoCCA scale includes five domains: demands, unnecessary tasks, role clarity, needs support, and goal orientation. The S-CVI was 0.964. Exploratory factor analysis yielded a five-factor structure that explained 74.952% of the total variance. According to the confirmatory factor analysis results, the fit indices were within the range of the reference values. Convergent and discriminant validity both met the criteria. Also, the scale's Cronbach's alpha coefficient is 0.936, and the five dimensions' values range from 0.818 to 0.909. The split-half reliability was 0.848, and the test-retest reliability was 0.832. CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese version of the Distribution of Co-Care Activities Scale had high levels of validity and reliability for chronic conditions. The scale can assess how patients with chronic diseases feel about their service of care and provide data to optimize their personalized chronic disease self-management strategies.",2023,,Front Public Health,11,,1091573,,10.3389/fpubh.2023.1091573,37139370,#1325,Zhou 2023,,,0
Racial and Ethnic Differences in Medication Initiation Among Adults Newly Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes.,Gopalan A; Winn AN; Karter AJ; Laiteerapong N,"OBJECTIVE: Given persistent racial/ethnic differences in type 2 diabetes outcomes and the lasting benefits conferred by early glycemic control, we examined racial/ethnic differences in diabetes medication initiation during the year following diagnosis. METHODS: Among adults newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (2005-2016), we examined how glucose-lowering medication initiation differed by race/ethnicity during the year following diagnosis. We specified modified Poisson regression models to estimate the association between race/ethnicity and medication initiation in the entire cohort and within subpopulations defined by HbA1c, BMI, age at diagnosis, comorbidity, and neighborhood deprivation index (a census tract-level socioeconomic indicator). RESULTS: Among the 77,199 newly diagnosed individuals, 47% started a diabetes medication within 12 months of diagnosis. The prevalence of medication initiation ranged from 32% among Chinese individuals to 58% among individuals of Other/Unknown races/ethnicities. Compared to White individuals, medication initiation was less likely among Chinese (relative risk: 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.72, 0.84)) and Japanese (0.82 (0.75, 0.90)) individuals, but was more likely among Hispanic/Latinx (1.27 (1.24, 1.30)), African American (1.14 (1.11, 1.17)), other Asian (1.13 (1.08, 1.18)), South Asian (1.10 (1.04, 1.17)), Other/Unknown (1.31 (1.24, 1.39)), American Indian or Alaska Native (1.11 (1.04, 1.18)), and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (1.28 (1.19, 1.37)) individuals. Racial/ethnic differences dissipated among individuals with higher HbA1c values. CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of glucose-lowering treatment during the year following type 2 diabetes diagnosis differed markedly by race/ethnicity, particularly for those with lower HbA1c values. Future research should examine how patient preferences, provider implicit bias, and shared decision-making contribute to these early treatment differences.",2023,Mar,J Gen Intern Med,38,4,994-1000,,10.1007/s11606-022-07746-4,35927604,#1493,Gopalan 2023,,,0

Economic evaluations of assisted reproductive technologies in high-income countries: a systematic review.,Olive E; Bull C; Gordon A; Davies-Tuck M; Wang R; Callander E,"STUDY QUESTION: Which assited reproductive technology (ART) interventions in high-income countries are cost-effective and which are not? SUMMARY ANSWER: Among all ART interventions assessed in economic evaluations, most high-cost interventions, including preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) for a general population and ICSI for unexplained infertility, are unlikely to be cost-effective owing to minimal or no increase in effectiveness. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Approaches to reduce costs in order to increase access have been identified as a research priority for future infertility research. There has been an increasing number of ART interventions implemented in routine clinical practice globally, before robust assessments of evidence on economic evaluations. The extent of clinical effectiveness of some studied comparisons has been evaluated in high-quality research, allowing more informative decision making around cost-effectiveness. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We performed a systematic review and searched seven databases (MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, COCHRANE, ECONLIT, SCOPUS, and CINAHL) for studies examining ART interventions for infertility together with an economic evaluation component (cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit, cost-utility, or cost-minimization assessment), in high-income countries, published since January 2011. The last search was 22 June 2022. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Two independent reviewers assessed publications and included those fulfilling the eligibility criteria. Studies were examined to assess the cost-effectiveness of the studied intervention, as well as the reporting quality of the study. The chosen outcome measure and payer perspective were also noted. Completeness of reporting was assessed against the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standard. Results are presented and summarized based on the intervention studied. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The review included 40 studies which were conducted in 11 high-income countries. Most studies (n = 34) included a cost-effectiveness analysis. ART interventions included medication or strategies for controlled ovarian stimulation (n = 15), IVF (n = 9), PGT-A (n = 7), single embryo transfer (n = 5), ICSI (n = 3), and freeze-all embryo transfer (n = 1). Live birth was the mostly commonly reported primary outcome (n = 27), and quality-adjusted life years was reported in three studies. The health funder perspective was used in 85% (n = 34) of studies. None of the included studies measured patient preference for treatment. It remains uncertain whether PGT-A improves pregnancy rates compared to IVF cycles managed without PGT-A, and therefore cost-effectiveness could not be demonstrated for this intervention. Similarly, ICSI in non-male factor infertility appears not to be clinically effective compared to standard fertilization in an IVF cycle and is therefore not cost-effective. Interventions such as use of biosimilars or HMG for ovarian stimulation are cheaper but compromise clinical effectiveness. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Lack of both preference-based and standardized outcomes limits the comparability of results across studies. The selection of efficacy evidence offered for some interventions for economic evaluations is not always based on high-quality randomized trials and systematic reviews. In addition, there is insufficient knowledge of the willingness to pay thresholds of individuals and state funders for treatment of infertility. There is variable quality of reporting scores, which might increase uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness results. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Investment in strategies to help infertile people who utilize ART is justifiable at both personal and population levels. This systematic review may assist ART funders decide how to best invest to maximize the likelihood of delivery of a healthy child.

Qualitative assessment of healthy volunteer experience receiving subcutaneous infusions of high-dose benzathine penicillin G (SCIP) provides insights into design of late phase clinical studies.,Enkel SL; Kado J; Hla TK; Salman S; Bennett J; Anderson A; Carapetis JR; Manning L,"INTRODUCTION: Secondary prophylaxis to prevent rheumatic heart disease (RHD) progression, in the form of four-weekly intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin G (BPG) injections, has remained unchanged since 1955. Qualitative investigations into patient preference have highlighted the need for long-acting penicillins to be delivered less frequently, ideally with reduced pain. We describe the experience of healthy volunteers participating in a phase-I safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic trial of subcutaneous infusions of high-dose benzathine penicillin G (BPG)-the SCIP study (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12622000916741). METHODS: Participants (n = 24) received between 6.9 mL to 20.7 mL (3-9 times the standard dose) of BPG as a single infusion into the abdominal subcutaneous tissues via a spring-driven syringe pump over approximately 20 minutes. Semi-structured interviews at four time points were recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Tolerability and specific descriptors of the experience were explored, alongside thoughts on how the intervention could be improved for future trials in children and young adults receiving monthly BPG intramuscular injections for RHD. RESULTS: Participants tolerated the infusion well and were able describe their experiences throughout. Most reported minimal pain, substantiated via quantitative pain scores. Abdominal bruising at the infusion site did not concern participants nor impair normal activities. Insight into how SCIP could be improved for children included the use of topical analgesia, distractions via television or personal devices, a drawn-out infusion time with reduced delivery speed, and alternative infusion sites. Trust in the trial team was high. CONCLUSION: Qualitative research is an important adjunct for early-phase clinical trials, particularly when adherence to the planned intervention is a key driver of success. These results will inform later-phase SCIP trials in people living with RHD and other indications.",2023,,PLoS One,18,4,e0285037,ANZCTR/ACTRN12622000916741,10.1371/journal.pone.0285037,37104500,#1313,Enkel 2023,,,0
How should patient decision aids for schizophrenia treatment be designed? - A scoping review.,Müller K; Schuster F; Rodolico A; Siafis S; Leucht S; Hamann J,"Despite the clear rationale for applying shared decision-making in the context of the preference sensitive decision for or against antipsychotics and the upswing of patient decision aids (pDAs) to support this process, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding which key features are crucial for pDAs in schizophrenia treatment. A scoping review according to the PRISMA-SRc was conducted to inform on crucial key features and quality indicators. The review focussed on the following seven aspects for investigating pDAs: (1) Types of decision aids, (2) Values, (3) Decision Guidance, (4) Output of the decision aid, (5) Target group, (6) Effectiveness according to publication and (7) Decision aid evaluation. Eleven studies which addressed six unique decision aids met the eligibility criteria. There were major differences in the design as well as in the development of the decision aids. Three aspects emerged that should be given special consideration in the design of such tools for antipsychotics: the evidence used by the decision aid, the algorithm for translating evidence into a decision aid and finally the presentation of the evidence. We recommend the use of data with a high level of evidence and to combine it with individualized treatment by taking into account patient preferences and previous experiences as well as comparing them with clinical assessments. Fully computerized decision aids that use complicated algorithms, for example, by merging treatment effects with patient characteristics to suggest an appropriate treatment at the end, tend to be paternalistic and thus not appropriate for SDM, in our view. In addition, possible cognitive deficits need to be considered when presenting the output of decision aids for antipsychotics.",2023,May,Schizophr Res,255,,261-273,,10.1016/j.schres.2023.03.025,37062107,#1271,Müller 2023,,,0

Effect of neridronate on axial involvement in patients with spondyloarthritis when biologics are not possible. Results of a monocentric study.,Crotti C; Di Taranto R; Orsini F; Ferrito M; Varenna M; Favalli EG; Caporali R,"INTRODUCTION: This study aims to examine the potential effectiveness of intravenous neridronate (IVNer) on axial involvement in patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA) refractory to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) but not eligible for biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). METHOD: Patients with active SpA (BASDAI score ≥ 4) and active sacroiliitis (SI) on MRI (according to ASAS MRI definition), who were NSAID-insufficient responder/intolerant but not eligible for bDMARDs, were retrospectively recruited in a tertiary rheumatology centre between September 2015 and December 2021. IVNer (100 mg) was administered to the patients on days 1, 4, 7, and 10. Responses were evaluated 60 days after the last infusion as the median changes from the baseline of BASDAI and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain and there are improvements on MRI signs. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients (26 axial SpA, 3 enteropathic arthritis, and 9 axial psoriatic arthritis) were included [66% women, mean age ± SD: 38.0 ± 14.1 years, mean disease duration: 30.5 ± 49.5 months (range 1.0-298), 47% HLAB27+]. The reason for bDMARD ineligibility was concurrent solid tumors (n = 6) or hematological (n = 1) malignancy, comorbidities (n = 11), or patient preference (n = 20). Both median BASDAI [5.83 (4.2-8.33) versus 3.66 (1.1-6.85), p < 0.001] and VAS pain [7 (5.75-8.0) versus 3 (1.0-7.0), p < 0.0001] significantly decreased after IVNer. Of 28 available MRI at follow-up, we observed a complete (36%) or partial (39%) resolution of sacroiliitis or a persistent activity (25%). DISCUSSION: IVNer was effective in improving axial involvement in patients with SpA refractory to NSAIDs but not eligible for bDMARDs. IVNer can be considered as a potential alternative therapeutic option in selected settings.",2023,,Front Med (Lausanne),10,,1282169,,10.3389/fmed.2023.1282169,38076262,#669,Crotti 2023,,,0
Patient Preferences for Pharmaceutical and Device-Based Treatments for Uncontrolled Hypertension: Discrete Choice Experiment.,Kandzari DE; Weber MA; Poulos C; Coulter J; Cohen SA; DeBruin V; Jones D; Pathak A,"BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiment is a survey method used to understand how individuals make decisions and to quantify the relative importance of features. Using discrete choice experiment methods, we quantified patient benefit-risk preferences for hypertension treatments, including pharmaceutical and interventional treatments, like renal denervation. METHODS: Respondents from the United States with physician-confirmed uncontrolled hypertension selected between treatments involving a procedure or pills, using a structured survey. Treatment features included interventional, noninterventional, or no hypertension treatment; number of daily blood pressure (BP) pills; expected reduction in office systolic BP; duration of effect; and risks of drug side effects, access site pain, or vascular injury. The results of a random-parameters logit model were used to estimate the importance of each treatment attribute. RESULTS: Among 400 patients completing the survey between 2020 and 2021, demographics included: 52% women, mean age 59.2±13.0 years, systolic BP 155.1±12.3 mm Hg, and 1.8±0.9 prescribed antihypertensive medications. Reduction in office systolic BP was the most important treatment attribute. The remaining attributes, in decreasing order, were duration of effect, whether treatment was interventional, number of daily pills, risk of vascular injury, and risk of drug side effects. Risk of access site pain did not influence choice. In general, respondents preferred noninterventional over interventional treatments, yet only a 2.3 mm Hg reduction in office systolic BP was required to offset this preference. Small reductions in office systolic BP would offset risks of vascular injury or drug side effects. At least a 20% risk of vascular injury or drug side effects would be tolerated in exchange for improved BP. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in systolic BP was identified as the most important driver of patient treatment preference, while treatment-related risks had less influence. The results indicate that respondents would accept interventional treatments in exchange for modest reductions in systolic BP compared with those observed in renal denervation trials.",2023,Jan,Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes,16,1,e008997,,10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.122.008997,36484251,#1634,Kandzari 2023,,,1
Evaluating Patient Preferences and Clinical Outcomes in Stress Urinary Incontinence Treatment: A Short-Term Follow-Up Study of the Transobturator Tape Procedure and Pubourethral Ligament Plication (a Minimally Invasive Technique).,Brasoveanu S; Ilina R; Balulescu L; Pirtea M; Secosan C; Grigoraș D; Olaru F; Erdelean D; Balint O; Margan MM; Ivan CS; Pirtea L,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide an in-depth analysis of patient preferences and clinical outcomes associated with two surgical techniques for treating stress urinary incontinence (SUI): the transobturator suburethral sling (TOT) procedure and the pubourethral ligament plication (PUL) procedure. We evaluated the rates of postoperative complications, the duration of each procedure, hemoglobin loss, and days of hospitalization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 80 patients who underwent surgery for SUI: 40 patients for the TOT procedure and 40 patients for the PUL procedure. Clinical data on patient characteristics, treatment efficacy, and post-surgical outcomes were analyzed to assess patient preferences and real-world clinical effectiveness. RESULTS: Regarding patient preferences, those who underwent TOT surgery were more likely to be older, had a higher average number of pregnancies, and were more often postmenopausal, in contrast to those who underwent PUL surgery (p < 0.001 for each comparison). TOT patients had a hospital stay on average of 1.02 days, while PUL patients benefited from ambulatory stays only. In addition, the TOT group had a significantly longer average operating time (16.80 min) compared to the PUL group (9.90 min, p < 0.001). The study revealed notable outcomes in both groups, with high cure rates for both TOT (N(1) = 33, 82.5%) and PUL (N(2) = 28, 70%) procedures. Specifically, 76.25% of the patients (61 out of 80) were cured after the procedures. Chronic pelvic pain was present in 3.75% of all patients and was notably only observed in the TOT group, with 3 (7.5%) cases being noted. Similarly, vaginal erosion was experienced by 5% of all patients, with 10% of patients in the TOT group and none in the PUL group being affected. Dyspareunia occurred in 2.5% of all patients, with there being two (5%) cases in the TOT group and none in the PUL group. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that while the PUL procedure achieves cure rates comparable to TOT, it offers a less invasive option with shorter operating times and no hospitalization required. These findings suggest that PUL could be a viable alternative for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) treatment, especially in contexts where avoiding mesh use is preferred. This adds significant value to patient-centered care in SUI management, offering tailored treatment options based on patient characteristics, preferences, and risk profiles.",2023,Dec,J Pers Med,14,1,,,10.3390/jpm14010034,38248735,#550,Brasoveanu 2023,,,0
Efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis: update for the practising clinician.,Szekanecz Z; Buch MH; Charles-Schoeman C; Galloway J; Karpouzas GA; Kristensen LE; Ytterberg SR; Hamar A; Fleischmann R,"Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, including tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib and filgotinib, are increasingly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There has been debate about their safety, particularly following the issuance of guidance by regulatory agencies advising caution in their use in certain patients. The registrational clinical trials and registry data of JAK inhibitors did not identify a difference in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), venous thromboembolism, malignancies or infections (other than herpes zoster) with a JAK inhibitor versus a biologic DMARD. In the ORAL Surveillance trial, which enrolled patients >50 years of age with ≥1 cardiovascular risk factor, tofacitinib was statistically inferior to TNF inhibitors for the occurrence of MACEs and malignancy. Further post hoc analysis of the data revealed that an age of ≥65 years, a high baseline cardiovascular risk, a history of smoking, sustained inflammation, disease activity and suboptimal treatment of cardiovascular comorbidities all increase the risk of these outcomes. The guidance issued by regulatory agencies should be carefully considered to ensure appropriate and safe treatment of patients with RA without undertreatment of patients who might benefit from JAK inhibitor, as well as biologic, treatment. As always, the risks associated with the use of these agents, treatment goals, costs and patient preferences should be discussed with the patient.",2024,Feb,Nat Rev Rheumatol,20,2,101-115,,10.1038/s41584-023-01062-9,38216757,#411,Szekanecz 2024,,,0
Comparing quality of recovery and satisfaction between spinal anesthesia and nerve block in orthopedic below-knee surgery: A prospective controlled trial.,Yoo SW; Kim T; Seo J; Oh H; Lee JH,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative quality of recovery (QoR) and patient satisfaction have gained increasing significance in medical services. This study aimed to compare these 2 parameters between 2 types of regional anesthetics (spinal anesthesia and combined sciatic-femoral nerve block) in orthopedic lower knee surgery. METHODS: A total of 101 patients were classified into 2 groups (combined sciatic-femoral nerve block, group N; spinal anesthesia, group S) according to patient preference. In group N, sciatic and femoral nerve blocks were performed on the popliteal and groin regions, respectively, under ultrasound guidance. Spinal anesthesia was performed in group S. The primary outcomes were QoR and patient satisfaction. QoR was measured using the Korean translation of the QoR-15K. Patient satisfaction was assessed using an 11-point Likert scale (0-10) and a dichotomous question addressing anesthesia preferences for future surgeries. RESULTS: The physical independence of the postoperative QoR-15K was significantly higher in group N than in group S (14.2 vs 12.0, P = .04). On the 11-point Likert scale, group N scored 8.8, and group S scored 7.8 (P = .001). In the dichotomous question, 93.8% of the group N and 52.8% of the group S answered that they would like to choose the same anesthesia method for the next surgery (P < .001). In addition, fewer participants in group N complained of backache than those in group S, and the time to first urination after anesthesia was shorter in group N than in group S (P = .004, <.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Combined sciatic-femoral nerve block may provide better physical independence and satisfaction than spinal anesthesia in orthopedic below-knee surgeries.",2024,Apr,Medicine (Baltimore),103,14,e37573,,10.1097/MD.0000000000037573,38579041,#170,Yoo 2024,,,0
"Short-term anti-TNF therapy with surgical closure versus anti-TNF therapy alone for Crohn's perianal fistulas (PISA-II): long-term outcomes of an international, multicentre patient preference, randomised controlled trial.",Meima-van Praag EM; Becker MAJ; van Rijn KL; Wasmann KATGM; Stoker J; D'Haens GRAM; Ponsioen CY; Gecse KB; Dijkgraaf MGW; Spinelli A; Danese S; Bemelman WA; Buskens CJ,"BACKGROUND: The PISA-II trial showed that short-term anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy followed by surgical closure induces radiological healing of perianal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease more frequently than anti-TNF therapy alone after 18 months. This study aimed to compare long-term outcomes of both treatment arms. METHODS: Follow-up data were collected from patients who participated in the PISA-II trial, an international patient preference randomised controlled trial. This multicentre trial was performed in nine hospitals in the Netherlands and one hospital in Italy. Patients with Crohn's disease above the age of 18 years with an active high perianal fistula and a single internal opening were asked to participate. Patients were allocated to anti-TNF therapy (intravenous infliximab, or subcutaneous adalimumab, at the discretion of the gastroenterologist) for one year, or surgical closure combined with 4-months anti-TNF therapy. Patients without a treatment preference were randomised (1:1) using random block randomisation (block sizes of six without stratification), and patients with a treatment preference were treated according to their preferred treatment arm. For the current follow-up study, data were collected until May 2022. Primary outcome was radiological healing on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including all participants with a MRI made less than 6 months ago at the time of data collection. Analysis was based on observed data. FINDINGS: Between September 14, 2013, and December 7, 2019, 94 patients were enrolled in the trial. Long-term follow-up data were available in 91 patients (36/38 (95%) anti-TNF + surgical closure, 55/56 (98%) anti-TNF). A total of 14/36 (39%) patients in the surgical closure arm were randomly assigned, which was not significantly different in the anti-TNF treatment arm (16/55 (29%) randomly assigned). Median follow-up was 5.7 years (interquartile range (IQR) 5-7). Radiological healing occurred significantly more often after anti-TNF + surgical closure (15/36 = 42% versus 10/55 = 18%; P = 0.014). Clinical closure was comparable (26/36 = 72% versus 34/55 = 62%; P = 0.18) in both groups. However, clinical closure in the surgical group was achieved with less re-interventions 4/26 (= 15%) versus 18/34 (= 53%), including (redo-)surgical closure procedures. Recurrences occurred in 0/25 (0%) patients with radiological healing versus 27/76 (36%) patients with clinical closure, sometime during follow-up. Anti-TNF trough levels were higher in patients with long-term clinical closure in both groups (P = 0.031 and P = 0.014). In 6/11 (55%) patients in the anti-TNF group with available trough levels, recurrences were diagnosed within three months of a drop under 3.5ug/ml. 36 patients stopped anti-TNF, after which 0/14 (0%) patients with radiological healing developed a recurrence and 9/22 (41%) with clinical closure. Self-rated (in)continence was comparable between groups, and 79% (60/76) of patients indicated comparable/improved continence after treatment. Decision-regret analysis showed that all (30/30) anti-TNF + surgical closure patients agreed or strongly agreed that surgery was the right decision versus 78% (36/46) in the anti-TNF arm. All surgical closure patients would go for the same treatment again, whereas this was 89% (41/46) in the anti-TNF arm. INTERPRETATION: This study confirmed that surgical closure should be considered in amenable patients with perianal fistulas and Crohn's disease as long-term outcomes were favourable, and that radiological healing should be the aim of treatment as recurrences only occurred in patients without radiological healing. In patients with complete MRI closure, anti-TNF could be safely stopped. FUNDING: None.",2023,Jul,EClinicalMedicine,61,,102045,,10.1016/j.eclinm.2023.102045,37457118,#1075,Meima-vanPraag 2023,,,0
Cancer treatments touch a wide range of values that count for patients and other stakeholders: What are the implications for decision-making?,Vrinzen CEJ; Bloemendal HJ; Stuart E; Makady A; van Agthoven M; Koster M; Merkx MAW; Hermens RPMG; Jeurissen PPT,"BACKGROUND: Cancer rates and expenditures are increasing, resulting in debates on the exact value of this care. Perspectives on what exactly constitutes worthwhile values differ. This study aims to explore all values-elements regarding new oncological treatments for patients with cancer and all stakeholders involved and to assess their implications in different decision-making procedures. METHOD: Thirty-one individual in-depth interviews were conducted with different stakeholders to identify values within oncology. A focus group with seven experts was performed to explore its possible implications in decision-making procedures. RESULTS: The overarching themes of values identified were impact on daily life and future, costs for patients and loved ones, quality of life, impact on loved ones, societal impact and quality of treatments. The expert panel revealed that the extended exploration of values that matter to patients is deemed useful in patient-level decision-making, information provision, patient empowerment and support during and after treatment. For national reimbursement decisions, implications for the broad range of values seems less clear. CONCLUSION: Clinical values are not the only ones that matter to oncological patients and the stakeholders in the field. We found a much broader range of values. Proper recognition of values that count might add to patient-level decision-making, but implications for reimbursement decisions are less clear. The results could be useful to guide clinicians and policymakers when it comes to decision-making in oncology. Making more explicit which values counts for whom guarantees a more systematic approach to decision-making on all levels.",2023,Mar,Cancer Med,12,5,6105-6116,,10.1002/cam4.5336,36373590,#1479,VrinzenCEJ 2023,,,0
"Effectiveness of group arts therapies (art therapy, dance movement therapy and music therapy) compared to group counselling for diagnostically heterogeneous psychiatric community patients: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial in mental health ",Carr CE; Medlicott E; Hooper R; Feng Y; Mihaylova B; Priebe S,"BACKGROUND: Arts therapies are widely but inconsistently provided in community mental health. Whilst they are appealing to patients, evidence for their effectiveness is mixed. Trials to date have been limited to one art-form or diagnosis. Patients may hold strong preferences for or against an art-form whilst group therapies rely on heterogeneity to provide a range of learning experiences. This study will test whether manualised group arts therapies (art therapy, dance movement therapy and music therapy) are effective in reducing psychological distress for diagnostically heterogeneous patients in community mental health compared to active group counselling control. METHODS: A pragmatic multi-centre 2-arm randomised controlled superiority trial with health economic evaluation and nested process evaluation. Adults aged ≥ 18, living in the community with a primary diagnosis of psychosis, mood, or anxiety disorder will be invited to participate and provide written informed consent. Participants are eligible if they score ≥ 1.65 on the Global Severity Index of the Brief Symptom Inventory. Those eligible will view videos of arts therapies and be asked for their preference. Participants are randomised to either their preferred type of group arts therapy or counselling. Groups will run twice per week in a community venue for 20 weeks. Our primary outcome is symptom distress at the end of intervention. Secondary outcomes include observer-rated symptoms, social situation and quality of life. Data will be collected at baseline, post-intervention and 6 and 12 months post-intervention. Outcome assessors and trial statisticians will be blinded. Analysis will be intention-to-treat. Economic evaluation will assess the cost-effectiveness of group arts therapies. A nested process evaluation will consist of treatment fidelity analysis, exploratory analysis of group process measures and qualitative interviews with participants and therapists. DISCUSSION: This will be the first trial to account for patient preferences and diagnostic heterogeneity in group arts therapies. As with all group therapies, there are a number of logistical challenges to which we have had to further adapt due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the study will provide evidence as to whether there is an additive benefit or not to the use of the arts in group therapy in community mental health care.

Interpretation services used for non-English language speaking patients with head and neck cancer: Findings from a tertiary London cancer centre.,Chartkul M; Cook F; Govender R,"BACKGROUND: Treatment for head and neck cancer (HNC) can lead to profound changes in swallowing function and nutrition. UK HNC standards recommend informational counselling is provided pre-treatment by the dietitian and speech and language therapist (SLT). Non-english speaking patients treated in English speaking countries have poorer treatment outcomes. UK guidance recommends all patients should have access to interpretation services where required. This audit aimed to investigate the language needs and utilisation of interpretation services for patients with HNC attending pre-treatment clinics. METHODS: A retrospective casenote audit over two-years (2021-2023) of all patients attending pre-treatment clinics in a centralised London cancer centre. Information was collected from electronic hospital records on demographics, disease/treatment characteristics, first language; categorised as English primary language (EPL), non-English primary language (NEPL) and interpretation requirements; formal (professional interpreters) or informal (patients friends/relatives). Data was processed and collated using Microsoft Excel (Version 2308). Descriptive statistics were conducted using Excel Analysis ToolPak. RESULTS: 408 patients were included. Most patients were male (67%), aged 61 ± 13 years. 18% (n = 74) had NEPL; 58 required interpretation services. Formal interpretation service was provided in 43% (n = 25), informal services in 33% (n = 19), and no service in 24% (n = 14). Non-adherence to formal services included lack of/inaccurate documentation of language needs, patient preference and lack of available interpreters. CONCLUSION: This audit indicated that barriers exist in utilising formal interpretation services. Future research should investigate how this can be optimised to ensure necessary language support is provided consistent with guidelines that promote equality, diversity, and inclusion.",2024,Mar,Oral Oncol Rep,9,,,,10.1016/j.oor.2024.100229,38545428,#269,Chartkul 2024,,,0
Ethical Aspects of Prodromal Synucleinopathy Prognostic Counseling.,Stefani A; Mozersky J; Kotagal V; Högl B; Ingravallo F; Ju YS; Avidan A; Sharp R; Videnovic A; Schenck CH; St Louis EK,"Alpha-synucleinopathies can be identified in their prodromal phase, raising several ethical issues. In this review, we first provide definitions of prodromal α-synucleinopathies and discuss the importance of distinguishing between prodromes and risk factors. Next, we discuss the implications of a diagnosis of prodromal α-synucleinopathy and considerations regarding prognostic counseling in both clinical and research settings. We review available data on patient preferences regarding disclosure as well as providers' perspectives. We examine the pros and cons of disclosing a diagnosis of prodromal α-synucleinopathy, taking into consideration the differences between clinical and research settings. Asking about willingness to know in clinical and research settings and the shared decision-making process applied to prognostic counseling is discussed. Concerning research settings, ethical aspects regarding clinical trials are addressed. Availability of direct-to-consumer technologies will likely lead to novel contexts requiring prognostic counseling, and future neuroprotective or neuromodulating treatments may require further considerations on the timing, role, and importance of prognostic counseling. Recommendations on how to address ethical gaps should be a priority for patients, medical professional societies, and research workgroups.

No obvious effect on mortality from a patient choice reform expanding access to opioid disorder treatment - results from a natural experiment of policy change in Sweden.,Håkansson A; Janfada-Baloo S; Berge J,"BACKGROUND: Opioid-related overdose deaths remain a common cause of death in many settings, and opioid maintenance treatment is evidence-based for the treatment of opioid use disorders. However, access to such treatment varies and is limited in many settings. METHODS: The present study examines the longitudinal effects of a regional patient choice reform which substantially increased availability to opioid maintenance treatment in one Swedish county, starting from 2014. A previous follow-up, limited in time, indicated a possible effect on mortality from this intervention, demonstrating a lower increase in overdose deaths than in counties without this reform. The present study follows overdose deaths through 2021, and compares the intervention county to the remaining parts in the country, using death certificate statistics from the national causes of death register. RESULTS: The present study does not demonstrate any significant difference in the development of overdose mortality in the county where this reform substantially expanded treatment access, compared to other counties in the country. CONCLUSIONS: The study underlines the importance to maintain extensive efforts against overdose deaths over and above the treatment of opioid use disorders, such as low-threshold provision of opioid antidotes or other interventions specifically addressing overdose risk behaviors.",2023,Nov,Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy,18,1,64,,10.1186/s13011-023-00577-4,37932776,#695,Håkansson 2023,,,0

However, we still lack high-level evidence in many areas relevant to making management decisions in daily clinical practise. The 2022 Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC 2022) addressed some questions in these areas to supplement guidelines that mostly are based on level 1 evidence. OBJECTIVE: To present the voting results of the APCCC 2022. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The experts voted on controversial questions where high-level evidence is mostly lacking: locally advanced prostate cancer; biochemical recurrence after local treatment; metastatic hormone-sensitive, non-metastatic, and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; oligometastatic prostate cancer; and managing side effects of hormonal therapy. A panel of 105 international prostate cancer experts voted on the consensus questions. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The panel voted on 198 pre-defined questions, which were developed by 117 voting and non-voting panel members prior to the conference following a modified Delphi process. A total of 116 questions on metastatic and/or castration-resistant prostate cancer are discussed in this manuscript. In 2022, the voting was done by a web-based survey because of COVID-19 restrictions. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The voting reflects the expert opinion of these panellists and did not incorporate a standard literature review or formal meta-analysis. The answer options for the consensus questions received varying degrees of support from panellists, as reflected in this article and the detailed voting results are reported in the supplementary material. We report here on topics in metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and oligometastatic and oligoprogressive prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These voting results in four specific areas from a panel of experts in advanced prostate cancer can help clinicians and patients navigate controversial areas of management for which high-level evidence is scant or conflicting and can help research funders and policy makers identify information gaps and consider what areas to explore further. However, diagnostic and treatment decisions always have to be individualised based on patient characteristics, including the extent and location of disease, prior treatment(s), co-morbidities, patient preferences, and treatment recommendations and should also incorporate current and emerging clinical evidence and logistic and economic factors. Enrolment in clinical trials is strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2022 once again identified important gaps where there is non-consensus and that merit evaluation in specifically designed trials. PATIENT SUMMARY: The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) provides a forum to discuss and debate current diagnostic and treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The conference aims to share the knowledge of international experts in prostate cancer with healthcare providers worldwide. At each APCCC, an expert panel votes on pre-defined questions that target the most clinically relevant areas of advanced prostate cancer treatment for which there are gaps in knowledge. The results of the voting provide a practical guide to help clinicians discuss therapeutic options with patients and their relatives as part of shared and multidisciplinary decision-making. This report focuses on the advanced setting, covering metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and both non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. TWITTER SUMMARY: Report of the results of APCCC 2022 for the following topics: mHSPC, nmCRPC, mCRPC, and oligometastatic prostate cancer.

Patient Perspectives of the Hospital Discharge Process: A Qualitative Study.,Jones KC; Austad K; Silver S; Cordova-Ramos EG; Fantasia KL; Perez DC; Kremer K; Wilson S; Walkey A; Drainoni ML,"Care transitions after hospitalization require communication across care teams, patients, and caregivers. As part of a quality improvement initiative, we conducted qualitative interviews with a diverse group of 53 patients who were recently discharged from a hospitalization within a safety net hospital to explore how patient preferences were included in the hospital discharge process and differences in the hospital discharge experience by race/ethnicity. Four themes emerged from participants regarding desired characteristics of interactions with the discharge team: (1) to feel heard, (2) inclusion in decision-making, (3) to be adequately prepared to care for themselves at home through bedside teaching, (4) and to have a clear and updated discharge timeline. Additionally, participants identified patient-level factors the discharge planning team should consider, including the social context, family involvement, health literacy, and linguistic barriers. Lastly, participants identified provider characteristics, such as a caring and empathetic bedside manner, that they found valuable in the discharge process.

Creating space to talk about patients' personal goals: experiences from primary care stakeholders.,Boeykens D; Haverals R; Sirimsi MM; Timmermans L; Van de Velde D; De Vriendt P; Boeckxstaens P,"BACKGROUND: To address the many challenges health systems and communities face, primary care is constantly searching for new strategies to improve quality of care. One of the strategies is to focus on patients' personal goals to direct the care process. To adopt an explicit focus on patients' personal goals, actions at different levels are required. As a first step in this process, this study aims to explore the experiences of primary care stakeholders (i.e., scholars, primary care providers, and policy makers) and develop a comprehensive understanding on the idea 'putting patients' goals first'. This will help to formulate suggestions about what these actions should include. METHOD: In this study, 41 primary care stakeholders participating in six focus groups between January 2020 and September 2020, were recruited via maximal variation purposive sampling. Data collection was done through an open-ended semi-structured interview guide. Focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed following a phenomenological-hermeneutical philosophy of Lindseth and Norberg. RESULTS: All participants expressed a strong fundamental belief for putting patients' personal goals first. The primary care providers shared that they created space for patients' personal goals by letting them talk about their values and stories. They reported to integrate their medical expertise with patients' personal goals in order to develop a balanced relationship. In this context, they also talked about the importance of taking into account the perspectives of patients' significant others. Primary care providers also talked about how they used patients' personal goals as a guide in interprofessional collaboration. Scholars denoted that (future) care providers need more training to acquire competencies to discuss patients' personal goals. The providers and policy makers talked about organizational limitations in terms of time restrictions and the lack of registration systems to support a workflow oriented towards patients' personal goals. CONCLUSIONS: This study can be used to support the coherence of the development of different actions and strategies to get primary care stakeholders fully on board to support the adoption of patients' personal goals in care delivery at different levels. However, models of practice and policy plans are needed to work towards a person-centered integrated system.",2023,Jan,BMC Prim Care,24,1,11,,10.1186/s12875-022-01956-9,36641431,#1590,Boeykens 2023,,,0
Comparison of Comfort and Patient Preference of Common and a Novel Position for Ultrasound-Guided Carpal Tunnel Injections.,Balser DY; Schwanz KL; Wheelock CJ; Crosby M; Schuerger W; Walters L; Weyrauch S; Senk AM,"OBJECTIVES: This study compared levels of discomfort among three positions for ultrasound-guided carpal tunnel injections (USCTI) to potentially facilitate and improve the procedure's tolerability in treating carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). METHODS: Ambulatory Veterans referred for electromyography (EMG) evaluation of CTS were eligible for the study; a total of 30 participants were evaluated. Participants were asked to hold three different positions: 1) Hypersupination, 2) Airplane, and 3) total supported abduction (TSA). Participants rated their pain level, ease of performing/holding each position, exacerbation of underlying symptoms, and position preference. Results were analyzed with two-way repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Hypersupination was determined to be the least preferred and most painful position to hold, demonstrating a statistically significant increase in the Numeric Rating Scale score for pain during the procedure compared with Airplane and TSA, which were not significantly different from one another. Pre-procedure neck, shoulder, elbow, and wrist pain were not significantly associated with intra-procedure pain. CONCLUSIONS: When performing USCTI, patient comfort can be optimized by avoiding Hypersupination. Utilizing the Airplane or TSA positions may provide similar access for ulnar approach injections while inducing lower levels of discomfort. Clinical space, resources, patient mobility, and laterality of procedures may further guide one's selection among the positions.",2024,Apr,J Ultrasound Med,43,4,751-760,,10.1002/jum.16401,38240323,#192,Balser 2024,,,0
Attitudes towards disposition of cryopreserved sperm in the event of death.,Buller D; Harnisch B; Lyall V; Goltzman M; Neuber E; Bartolucci A; Honig S,"INTRODUCTION: To evaluate patient preference for sperm disposition in case of death based on demographic factors and infertility etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed at a university hospital-affiliated fertility center. Charts of 550 men undergoing cryopreservation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) between 2016-2019 were reviewed to create a descriptive dataset. Patients previously signed consent forms stating their preference for sperm transfer to their partner or disposal in the event of their subsequent death. Patients undergoing sperm cryopreservation for the purpose of ART were analyzed to assess associations between demographic characteristics and etiology of infertility and their choice to either transfer sperm to their partner or discard. RESULTS: A total of 84.9% (342/403) of patients included in final analyses elected to transfer their sperm to their partner in the event of their death. Factors associated with a significantly increased likelihood to transfer versus discard included a male-factor infertility diagnosis compared to female-factor infertility diagnosis (transfer rate 89.3% vs. 79.9%; p = .022) and commercial insurance coverage versus non-commercial/no insurance coverage (transfer rate 86.3% vs. 75.0%, p = .029). No significant differences relating to age, race/ethnicity, occupation classification, marital status or duration of marriage, or prior paternity were found. CONCLUSION: A majority of male patients seeking sperm cryopreservation for ART elected to transfer their sperm to their partner if future death should occur. There does not appear to be a clear factor that would impact this decision based on demographic characteristics.",2023,Aug,Can J Urol,30,4,11613-11618,,,37633289,#996,Buller 2023,,,0
The Influence of Patient Preference on Surgeons' Treatment Recommendations in the Management of Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms.,Sacks GD; Shin P; Braithwaite RS; Soares KC; Kingham TP; D'Angelica MI; Drebin JA; Jarnagin WR; Wei AC,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether surgeon variation in management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) is driven by differences in risk perception and quantify surgeons' risk threshold for changing their recommendations. BACKGROUND: Surgeons vary widely in management of IPMN. METHODS: We conducted a survey of members of the Americas HepatoPancreatoBiliary Association, presented participants with 2 detailed clinical vignettes and asked them to choose between surgical resection and surveillance. We also asked them to judge the likelihood that the IPMN harbors cancer and that the patient would have a serious complication if surgery was performed. Finally, we asked surgeons to rate the level of cancer risk at which they would change their treatment recommendation. We examined the association between surgeons' treatment recommendations and their risk perception and risk threshold. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty surgeons participated in the study. Surgeons varied in their recommendations for surgery [19% for vignette 1 (V1) and 12% for V2] and in their perception of the cancer risk (interquartile range: 2%-10% for V1 and V2) and risk of surgical complications (V1 interquartile range: 10%-20%, V2 20%-30%). After adjusting for surgeon characteristics, surgeons who were above the median in cancer risk perception were 22 percentage points (27% vs. 5%) more likely to recommend resection than those who were below the median (95% CI: 11.34%; P <0.001). The median risk threshold at which surgeons would change their recommendation was 15% (V1 and V2). Surgeons who recommended surgery had a lower risk threshold for changing their recommendation than those who recommended surveillance (V1: 10.0 vs. 15.0, P =0.06; V2: 7.0 vs. 15.0, P =0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The treatment that patients receive for IPMNs depends greatly on how their surgeons perceive the risk of cancer in the lesion. Efforts to improve cancer risk prediction for IPMNs may lead to decreased variations in care.",2023,Nov,Ann Surg,278,5,e1068-e1072,,10.1097/SLA.0000000000005829,36804447,#749,Sacks 2023,,,0
Patient Preferences for Lung Cancer Interception Therapy.,Janssen EM; Smith IP; Liu X; Pierce A; Huang Q; Kalsekar I; Vachani A; Mansfield C,"IMPORTANCE: Interception therapy requires individuals to undergo treatment to prevent a future medical event, but little is known about preferences of individuals at high risk for lung cancer and whether they would be interested in this type of treatment. OBJECTIVE: To explore preferences of individuals at high risk for lung cancer for potential interception therapies to reduce this risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study used a discrete-choice experiment and included hypothetical lung cancer interception treatments with 4 attributes: reduction in lung cancer risk over 3 years, injection site reaction severity, nonfatal serious infection, and death from serious infection. Respondents were assigned to a baseline lung cancer risk of 6%, 10%, or 16% over 3 years. The discrete-choice experiment was administered online (July 13 to September 6, 2022) to US respondents eligible for lung cancer screening according to US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines. Participants included adults aged 50 to 80 years with at least a 20 pack-year smoking history. Statistical analysis was performed from September to December 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Attribute-level preference weights were estimated, and conditional relative attribute importance, maximum acceptable risks, and minimum acceptable benefits were calculated. Characteristics of respondents who always selected no treatment were also explored. RESULTS: Of the 803 survey respondents, 495 (61.6%) were female, 138 (17.2%) were African American or Black, 55 (6.8%) were Alaska Native, American Indian, or Native American, 44 (5.5%) were Asian or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 104 (13.0%) were Hispanic, Latin American, or Latinx, and 462 (57.5%) were White, Middle Eastern or North African, or a race or ethnicity not listed; and mean (SD) age was 63.0 (7.5) years. Most respondents were willing to accept interception therapy and viewed reduction in lung cancer risk as the most important attribute. Respondents would accept a greater than or equal to a 12.0 percentage point increase in risk of nonfatal serious infection if lung cancer risk was reduced by at least 20.0 percentage points; and a greater than or equal to 1.2 percentage point increase in risk of fatal serious infection if lung cancer risk was reduced by at least 30.0 percentage points. Respondents would require at least a 15.4 (95% CI, 10.6-20.2) percentage point decrease in lung cancer risk to accept a 12.0 percentage point increase in risk of nonfatal serious infection; and at least a 23.1 (95% CI, 16.4-29.8) percentage point decrease in lung cancer risk to accept a 1.2 percentage point increase in risk of death from serious infection. Respondents who were unwilling to accept interception therapy in any question (129 [16.1%]) were more likely to be older and to currently smoke with no prior cessation attempt, and less likely to have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or examined for skin cancer. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of individuals at high risk of lung cancer, most respondents were willing to consider interception therapy. These results suggest the importance of benefit-risk assessments for future lung cancer interception treatments.",2023,Nov,JAMA Netw Open,6,11,e2342681,,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.42681,37948077,#706,Janssen 2023,Rosanna Irene Comoretto (2024-04-10 01:55:10)(Screen): tecnicamente non sono pazienti ma persone a rischio; ,,1
Preferences for Adjuvant Immunotherapy in Adults with Resected Stage III Melanoma-A Discrete Choice Experiment.,Livingstone A; Howard K; Menzies AM; Long GV; Stockler MR; Morton RL,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to quantify adult preferences for adjuvant immunotherapy for resected melanoma and the influence of varying levels of key attributes and baseline characteristics. METHODS: A D-efficient design generated 12 choice tasks for two alternative treatments, adjuvant immunotherapy or no adjuvant immunotherapy. Recruitment to the online discrete choice experiment (DCE) occurred via survey dissemination by eight Australian melanoma consumer and professional groups, targeting adults with resected stage III melanoma, considering or having received adjuvant immunotherapy. The DCE included six attributes with two to three levels each, including 3-year risk of recurrence, mild, permanent and fatal adverse events (AEs), drug regimen and annual out-of-pocket costs. A mixed multinomial logit model was used to estimate preferences and calculate marginal rates of substitution and marginal willingness to pay (mWTP). RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 116 respondents, who chose adjuvant immunotherapy over no adjuvant immunotherapy in 70% of choice tasks. Respondents preferred adjuvant immunotherapy when associated with reduced: probabilities of recurrence, permanent and fatal AEs, and out-of-pocket costs. mWTP for an absolute reduction of 1% in 3-year risk of recurrence was less for respondents with lower rather than higher incomes, AU$794 (US$527) and AU$2190 (US$1454) per year. Respondents accepted an additional 4% chance of a permanent AE to reduce their absolute risk of 3-year recurrence by 1%. Respondents were willing to accept an extra 2% chance of 3-year recurrence to lower their chance of a fatal AE by 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Almost three-quarters of respondents chose adjuvant immunotherapy over no adjuvant immunotherapy, preferring treatment that improved efficacy and safety. Findings may inform decisions about access to adjuvant immunotherapy following surgery for melanoma.",2023,Sep,Patient,16,5,497-513,,10.1007/s40271-023-00635-w,37351797,#929,Livingstone 2023,,,1
Perspectives of hospitalized heart failure patients: preferred and perceived participation roles in treatment decisions.,Sekine O; Kitakata H; Kohsaka S; Fujisawa D; Nakano N; Shiraishi Y; Kishino Y; Katsumata Y; Yuasa S; Fukuda K; Kohno T,"Shared decision-making (SDM) is a pivotal process in seeking optimal individual treatment and incorporating clinical evidence and patients' autonomous preferences. However, patients' actual attitudes toward participation in decision-making for state-of-the-art heart failure (HF) treatment remain unclear. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey distributed by nurses and physicians specializing in HF care to assess patients' preferred and perceived participation roles in treatment decision-making during the index hospitalization, rated on five scales (from extremely passive to purely autonomous attitudes). Simultaneously, we investigated the important factors underlying treatment decision-making from the perspective of hospitalized HF patients. Of the 202 patients who were approached by our multidisciplinary HF team between 2017 and 2020, 166 (82.2%) completed the survey. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the clinical determinants of patients who reported that they left all decisions to physicians (i.e., extremely passive attitude). Of the 166 participants (male 67.5%, median age 73 years), 32.5% preferred an extremely passive attitude, while 61.4% reported that they actually chose an extremely passive attitude. A sole determinant of choosing an extremely passive decision-making role was lower educational status (odds ratio: 2.11, 95% confidence interval 1.11-4.00). The most important factor underlying the decision-making was ""Physician recommendation"" (89.2%). Notably, less than 50% considered ""In alignment with my values and preferences"" as an important factor underlying treatment decision-making. The majority of HF patients reported that they chose an extremely passive approach, and patients prioritized physician recommendation over their own values and preferences.",2023,Oct,Heart Vessels,38,10,1244-1255,,10.1007/s00380-023-02275-4,37264250,#839,Sekine 2023,,,0
Development of an Interactive Tool to Support Shared Decision-Making in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Treatment Attribute Preference.,Curtis JR; Ford K; Fiore S; Mikuls TR; Shaney K; Sethi V,"OBJECTIVE: An interactive tool identifying treatment attributes important to patients can enhance shared decision-making (SDM) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A formative survey was conducted to identify the most important treatment attributes from patients' perspective, which can be used to develop an interactive SDM tool. METHODS: The survey was performed in two phases: qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys. The qualitative interviews were conducted to inform the design of the quantitative survey. In qualitative interviews, patients with RA (n = 10) and rheumatologists (n = 10) were introduced to the SDM tool concept. Feedback on the design and scope of the SDM tool was used to develop a quantitative survey, conducted in a large sample size of patients. Patient preferences for treatment attributes (route of administration and dosing frequency, serious side effects, out-of-pocket costs, efficacy, and monitoring requirement) were assessed via adaptive conjoint exercise involving ranking of hypothetical RA treatment configurations. RESULTS: A total of 944 patients (males: 43%, females: 57%) with RA participated in the quantitative survey. Route of administration and dosing frequency (38%) followed by serious side effects (33%) were the two most important treatment attributes for individual patients. The recontact survey (n = 172/944) estimated tool stability of 72% (n = 124/172) in terms of the relative importance of treatment attributes. CONCLUSION: The findings of this survey could be used in the development of an SDM tool that can potentially provide insights into patient preferences and is generally well received by patients and rheumatologists with good agreement and reliability.",2024,Feb,Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken),76,2,181-190,,10.1002/acr.25223,37652871,#436,Curtis 2024,,,1
ADCC's Improving Goal Concordant Care Initiative: Implementing Primary Palliative Care Principles.,Loggers ET; Case AA; Chwistek M; Dale W; Delgado Guay MO; Edge SB; Grossman SR; Gustin J; Nelson J; Rajasekhara S; Reddy A; Tulsky JA; Zachariah F; Landrum KM,"BACKGROUND: High-quality, timely goals of care communication (GOCC) may improve patient and caregiver outcomes and promote care that is consistent with patient preferences. PROBLEM: Cancer patients, and their loved ones, appreciate GOCC; however, oncologists often lack formal communication training, institutional support and structures necessary to promote the delivery, documentation, and longitudinal follow-up of GOCC. PROPOSED SOLUTION: The Alliance of Dedicated Cancer Centers (ADCC), representing 10 U.S. academic cancer hospitals, undertook the Improving Goal Concordant Care Initiative (IGCC). This national, 3-year implementation initiative was designed in Fall 2019 by a workgroup of quality, oncology, and palliative care leaders, as well as patient and family advisory committee members (PFAC). IGCC addresses systemic gaps by requiring four core components for participation: 1) Implementation of a formal communication skills training (CST) program, 2) Structured GOCC documentation in the electronic medical record that is visible to all clinicians, 3) Expectations regarding the timing and patient populations for GOCC, and 4) Implementation of a measurement framework. METHOD: Dyads of palliative and oncology leaders committed to attend regularly scheduled, ADCC-led, virtual meetings during the design and implementation phase, incorporating PFAC feedback at every stage. Using the RE-AIM framework, we describe process and outcome evaluation measures defined by implementation and measures workgroups and collected routinely, including: CST completion; trainee evaluation response rate, trainee-reported quality of CST, trainee changes in self-efficacy and distress; percent of high-priority patients participating in GOCC, and patient-reported response to the ""Heard and Understood"" scale (HU). IGCC's impact will be assessed using claims-based utilization metrics near the end of life (EOLM) and followed longitudinally. Qualitative evaluations near the completion of IGCC will provide insight into perceived barriers, enabling factors, and sustainability. OUTCOMES: Implementation of all IGCC components has begun at all sites. ADCC-wide, 35% of MD/DOs have completed CST (range by site: 8%-100%). CST is highly rated; in Quarter 3, 2022, 93%-100%, 90%-100% and 87%-100% of respondents reported above average to excellent CST quality, likelihood to use the skills and likelihood to recommend CST to others, respectively. Clinician self-efficacy and distress ratings are expected in late 2023. All sites have identified patient populations and continue to refine automated triggers and timelines; uptake of GOCC documentation has been slow. Eight of 10 sites have submitted patient-reported HU data. EOLM data are expected for all sites in early 2024. LESSONS LEARNED: Flexibility in implementation with shared definitions, measures, and learnings about approaches optimizes the ability of all centers to collaborate and make progress in improving GOCC. Flexibility adds to the complexity of understanding intervention effectiveness, the critical intervention components and the fidelity necessary to achieve specific outcomes.",2023,Aug,J Pain Symptom Manage,66,2,e283-e297,,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2023.05.008,37257523,#1013,Loggers 2023,,,0
"Kidney biopsy in diabetic kidney disease. Yes, but in very selected cases.",Zoccali C,"The debate on kidney biopsy in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is multifaceted. Loreto Gesualdo and colleagues argue for its broader application, claiming that biopsies can offer precise diagnostic data and guide personalized treatment plans. On the other hand, Alberto Ortiz opposes this, citing insufficient evidence, resource constraints and potential risks. He suggests that alternative diagnostic methods, such as advanced imaging techniques and serological markers, will obviate the need for biopsy in most patients. Both sides agree on the need for individualized patient care, and open discussions between healthcare providers and patients about the procedure's risks and benefits. The application of kidney biopsy in these patients needs to consider clinical evidence, practical limitations and patient preferences, and demands a balanced, case-by-case approach. Overall, this moderator believes that, although fundamental in clinical research, kidney biopsy in DKD is infrequently needed.",2024,Jan,Clin Kidney J,17,1,sfad268,,10.1093/ckj/sfad268,38186901,#502,Zoccali 2024,,,0
Patient choice of surgery or surveillance following a clinical complete response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for oesophageal carcinoma.,Walsh TN; Kharytaniuk N; Furlong H; Sorensen J; O'Neill BDP; Breathnach OS; Grogan L,,2024,Jan,Br J Surg,111,1,,,10.1093/bjs/znad352,37933675,#495,Walsh 2024,"Martina Di Blasio  (2024-06-07 19:11:28)(Screen): Over half of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for oesophageal cancer have a clinical complete response (cCR)1, over 70 per cent of whom have a pathological complete response (pCR)2. Current pathways mandate resection, regardless of response. However, patients with a pCR cannot benefit from resection, yet face its risks—persistent symptoms (70 per cent)3, serious morbidity (50 per cent)4, anastomotic leakage (10–30 per cent)5, and only 13.8 per cent return to same-activity work3. This poses an ethical dilemma. If there is no residual cancer in the resected specimen, the surgeon may be accused of overtreatment, especially if there is serious morbidity or mortality. Failure to resect a patient who subsequently develops recurrence exposes the surgeon to accusation of undertreatment. An alternative approach is to mandate resection only for patients with residual disease and offer patients with a cCR a choice of resection or surveillance, with salvage surgery for resectable recurrence. We hypothesized that allowing patients such a choice would result in a non-inferior outcome. The aim of this observational study was to examine the survival of patients that underwent surgery or surveillance.; ",,0

Infection occurs when host basal cells are exposed to viral infection through a damaged epithelial barrier, during sexual intercourse, or due to other minor skin abrasions. Giant condyloma acuminatum (GCA) has a higher rate of malignant transformation than CA. CASE PRESENTATION: We are presenting a 44-year-old single gentleman known as a smoker, hepatitis B positive, vitiligo, and hypercholesteromia. He was an alcoholic and had multiple heterosexual relationships abroad. Referred from the dermatology clinic, complaining of genital warts that had increased in size for 10 years. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: CA management includes local applications like imiquimod and podophyllotoxin and clinician-administered treatments such as cryotherapy, surgical excision, electrosurgery, and CO(2) laser therapy. Other options, such as interferon, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy, are available. The selection of therapy should be individualized and based upon consideration of the extent of the disease, patient preference, cost, adverse effects, treatment availability, and the response to previous treatments. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice for GCA.

Donor Site Satisfaction Following Autologous Fat Transfer for Total Breast Reconstruction.,Wederfoort JLM; van Santbrink E; Hommes JE; Heuts EM; Van Kuijk SMJ; van der Hulst RRWJ; Piatkowski A,"BACKGROUND: With evolving breast cancer survival and patient preferences, it is essential that reconstructive surgeons worldwide continue searching for the best reconstruction technique for patients. Autologous fat transfer (AFT) is a relatively new technique for total breast reconstruction that has already proven to be effective and safe with all advantages of autologous tissue. However, little is known about the aesthetic results and satisfaction concerning donor sites. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to measure donor site satisfaction following AFT for total breast reconstruction in breast cancer patients. METHODS: Between May and August of 2021, participants of the BREAST- trial who were at least 24 months after their final reconstruction surgery were invited to complete an additional survey concerning donor sites. The BODY-Q was utilized for data collection. Results of AFT patients were compared with a control group of implant-based reconstruction patients who did not have a donor site. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients (20 control, 31 intervention) completed the questionnaire. Satisfaction with body did not statistically differ between the groups. The most frequent complaint was contour irregularities (31 reports, 60.8%), with the least favorable donor site being thighs (23 reports, 53.5%) in the AFT group. CONCLUSIONS: Satisfaction with body did not differ between breast cancer patients receiving AFT or implant-based reconstruction, meaning that large-volume liposuction does not aesthetically affect the utilized donor sites. Nevertheless, reconstructive surgeons should be aware of possible donor site complications, especially contour irregularities at the thighs, and discuss this with their patients.",2023,Jan,Aesthet Surg J,43,1,40-48,,10.1093/asj/sjac125,35580058,#1597,WederfoortJLM 2023,,,0
"People With Diabetes and Caregivers Prefer Rescue Glucagon Treatment With a Wider Storage Temperature Range and a Nasal Administration, When Efficacy is Similar: A Discrete Choice Experiment in Spain.",Mitchell BD; Rentz AM; Kummer S; Yan Y; Heidenreich S; Krucien N; Artime E; Osumili B; Rubio M; Gelhorn HL,"BACKGROUND: Conventional injectable glucagon (IG) and nasal glucagon (NG), both having similar efficacy, are two options for the emergency treatment of severe hypoglycemia in Spain. This study elicited the effect of changes in key attributes on preferences for NG and IG medication profiles of people with diabetes and caregivers in Spain. METHODS: The relative attribute importance (RAI) that participants placed on glucagon preparation, preparation and administration time, delivery method, recovery time, device size, storage temperature, and headache risk was estimated from an online discrete choice experiment. In addition, patients and caregivers were presented with NG and IG profiles that included rates of successful administration; the proportion of participants choosing each profile was summarized. RESULTS: The analysis included 276 adults with diabetes (65% type 1) and 270 caregivers (49% type 1). Overall mean age was 40 years; 51% were female. The most important attributes were storage temperature (RAI [95% confidence interval] = 27.3% [22.9-32.2]) and delivery method (17.4% [13.1-21.9]). Headache risk (16.2% [11.8-20.7]), time to prepare and administer (14.5% [10.1-18.8]), glucagon preparation (11.4% [6.8-15.8]), recovery time (8.9% [4.3-13.3]), and device size (4.3% [0.3-8.8]) were also relevant. When comparing medication profiles, significantly more participants (78%) preferred NG over IG profiles (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Adults with diabetes and caregivers prefer a glucagon treatment with a higher rate of successful administration, wider storage temperature, and nasal delivery method, when efficacy is similar. Participants favored NG over conventional IG as a rescue medication for severe hypoglycemia.

Nonetheless, we continue to lack high-level evidence on a variety of clinical topics that greatly impact daily practice. To supplement evidence-based guidelines, the 2022 Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC 2022) surveyed experts about key dilemmas in clinical management. OBJECTIVE: To present consensus voting results for select questions from APCCC 2022. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Before the conference, a panel of 117 international prostate cancer experts used a modified Delphi process to develop 198 multiple-choice consensus questions on (1) intermediate- and high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer, (2) biochemical recurrence after local treatment, (3) side effects from hormonal therapies, (4) metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, (5) nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, (6) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and (7) oligometastatic and oligoprogressive prostate cancer. Before the conference, these questions were administered via a web-based survey to the 105 physician panel members (""panellists"") who directly engage in prostate cancer treatment decision-making. Herein, we present results for the 82 questions on topics 1-3. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Consensus was defined as ≥75% agreement, with strong consensus defined as ≥90% agreement. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The voting results reveal varying degrees of consensus, as is discussed in this article and shown in the detailed results in the Supplementary material. The findings reflect the opinions of an international panel of experts and did not incorporate a formal literature review and meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These voting results by a panel of international experts in advanced prostate cancer can help physicians and patients navigate controversial areas of clinical management for which high-level evidence is scant or conflicting. The findings can also help funders and policymakers prioritise areas for future research. Diagnostic and treatment decisions should always be individualised based on patient and cancer characteristics (disease extent and location, treatment history, comorbidities, and patient preferences) and should incorporate current and emerging clinical evidence, therapeutic guidelines, and logistic and economic factors. Enrolment in clinical trials is always strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2022 once again identified important gaps (areas of nonconsensus) that merit evaluation in specifically designed trials. PATIENT SUMMARY: The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) provides a forum to discuss and debate current diagnostic and treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The conference aims to share the knowledge of international experts in prostate cancer with health care providers and patients worldwide. At each APCCC, a panel of physician experts vote in response to multiple-choice questions about their clinical opinions and approaches to managing advanced prostate cancer. This report presents voting results for the subset of questions pertaining to intermediate- and high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer, biochemical relapse after definitive treatment, advanced (next-generation) imaging, and management of side effects caused by hormonal therapies. The results provide a practical guide to help clinicians and patients discuss treatment options as part of shared multidisciplinary decision-making. The findings may be especially useful when there is little or no high-level evidence to guide treatment decisions.",2023,Mar,Eur Urol,83,3,267-293,,10.1016/j.eururo.2022.11.002,36494221,#1470,Gillessen 2023,,,0
Patient preferences for physical therapy programs after a lower extremity fracture: a discrete choice experiment.,McKibben NS; Marchand LS; Demyanovich HK; Healey KM; Zingas N; O'Connor K; Slobogean GP; O'Toole RV; O'Hara NN,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify patients' preferences for physical therapy programmes after a lower extremity fracture and determine patient factors associated with preference variation. DESIGN: Discrete choice experiment. SETTING: Level I trauma centre. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty-one adult (≥18 years old) patients with lower extremity fractures treated operatively. INTERVENTION: Patients were given hypothetical scenarios and asked to select their preferred therapy course when comparing cost, mobility, long-term pain, session duration, and treatment setting. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A multinomial logit model was used to determine the relative importance and willingness to pay for each attribute. RESULTS: Mobility was of greatest relative importance (45%, 95% CI: 40% to 49%), more than cost (23%, 95% CI: 19% to 27%), long-term pain (19%, 95% CI: 16% to 23%), therapy session duration (12%, 95% CI: 9% to 5%) or setting (1%, 95% CI: 0.2% to 2%). Patients were willing to pay US$142 more per session to return to their preinjury mobility level (95% CI: US$103 to US$182). Willingness to pay for improved mobility was higher for women, patients aged 70 years and older, those with bachelor's degrees or higher and those living in less-deprived areas. Patients were willing to pay US$72 (95% CI: US$50 to US$93) more per session to reduce pain from severe to mild. Patients were indifferent between formal and independent home therapy (willingness to pay: -US$12, 95% CI: -US$33 to US$9). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lower extremity fractures highly value recovering mobility and are willing to pay more for postoperative physical therapy programmes that facilitate returning to their pre-injury mobility level. These patient preferences might be useful when prescribing and designing new techniques for postoperative therapy.",2023,Oct,BMJ Open,13,10,e072583,,10.1136/bmjopen-2023-072583,37798021,#789,McKibben 2023,,,1
Indiana Pouch Continent Cutaneous Urinary Diversion After Robotic-assisted Radical Cystectomy: A 16-Year Experience.,Kim AH; Ruel NH; Yamzon J; Zhumkhawala AA; Lau CS; Yuh BE; Chan KG,"BACKGROUND: Population-based practice patterns in the United States reveal continent diversions are only performed in 8%-10.4% of patients.(1-4) Ideally, for patients undergoing radical cystectomy the choice of urinary diversion should be influenced by clinical factors and patient preference, with discussions surrounding quality of life. Unfortunately, receipt of continent diversion has been shown to be influenced by a plethora of other factors such as surgeon preference/training, geography, socioeconomic status, gender, and hospital volume.(1-3) Thus, by providing detailed instruction and long-term follow-up, we hope to mitigate some of these disparities by changing the perceptions regarding feasibility and complications of continent diversions. OBJECTIVE: To provide step-by-step instruction and to report long-term clinical outcomes in bladder cancer patients receiving an Indiana pouch continent cutaneous urinary diversion (CCUD) after robot-assisted radical cystectomy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: After Institutional Review Board approval, a prospectively maintained bladder cancer database was queried for patients with T1-T4, N0-N1, M0 bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy with CCUD at a tertiary referral center from 2004 to 2020. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Complications at 30- and 90-day were recorded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Continence rates were recorded by chart review. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 97 patients were included with a median follow-up of 93months. Clinically, 91.8% had ≤T2 disease and 29.9% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The median length of surgery was 8.0 hours, length of hospital stay was 8.3days, and urinary continence rate was 99.0%. The overall complication rate was 73.2% and 76.5% at 30- and 90-day, respectively. The major complication rate (Clavien III-V) was 17.5% at 30-day and 22.7% at 90-day. The most common major complications were abdominal infection and uretero-colonic stricture. The readmission rate was 21.4% and median overall survival was 108months. CONCLUSION: CCUD provides exceptional functional outcomes with acceptable complication rates compared to other diversion types. CCUD is a reliable reconstructive option and with this step-by-step video as a reference, we hope it will be offered to more patients.",2024,Jan,Urology,183,,e325-e327,,10.1016/j.urology.2023.10.023,37951362,#518,Kim 2024,,,0
Patient Perception of Route of Rectal Administration of Live Biotherapeutic Product for Recurrent Clostridioides difficile Infection.,Feuerstadt P; Oneto C; Tillotson G; Van Hise NW,"INTRODUCTION: CDI is a recurrent disease that is treated with antibiotics, but patients commonly experience repeat infections with significant impacts on hospital budgets and patient health quality. Standard of care management includes the antibiotics, vancomycin and fidaxomicin, which frequently provide clinical response, but do not avoid recurrence of Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI). These recurrent infections occur due to dysbiosis of the colonic microbiota. One adjunctive therapeutic approach is to restore the deficient gastrointestinal flora using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or live biotherapeutic products (LBP) when given after standard of care antimicrobials, which have been successful in reducing repeat infections with success rates up to 88%. FMT or LBP can be given by various routes. METHODS: Two groups of subjects aged ≥18 years with at least one previous CDI episode within the previous 36 months completed self-administered online surveys to assess the acceptability of an LBP administered rectally. Group 1 consisted of LBP-recipients who had received RBL (REBYOTA) rectally as part of the Phase III PUNCH CD3 clinical trial. Group 2 consisted of LBP-naïve subjects who volunteered to participate and had experienced CDI within the prior 36 months but had no history of receiving FMT or LBP therapy. RESULTS: LBP-recipients considered rectal administration easy (96%) and quick (94%), while 98% of respondents considered the lack of need for bowel preparation appealing. Most LBP-recipients (96%) wished they had earlier access to RBL. Most LBP-naïve subjects (87%) were likely or somewhat likely to consider a rectally administered treatment and 80% preferred a treatment option that does not require bowel preparation. Many of these subjects (76%) expressed interest in finding out about new treatment options for rCDI. DISCUSSION: LBP-recipients and LBP-naïve subjects alike felt that rectal delivery of microbiome therapy is not only acceptable but highly interesting as a treatment avenue.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,2153-2159,,10.2147/PPA.S415681,37667688,#959,Feuerstadt 2023,,,0

This comprehensive narrative review delves into their anatomy, pathophysiology, and modern treatment options, with a focus on endovenous techniques and sclerotherapy. The review starts by emphasizing the intricate anatomy of lower extremity venous circulation, underlining the significance of both superficial and deep venous networks in venous return. It also addresses how changes in the venous wall, including valvular insufficiency, contribute to the development of varicose veins. Endovenous techniques like endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA) are explored in detail. These minimally invasive procedures have revolutionized varicose vein treatment, offering high success rates and quicker recovery compared to traditional surgery. The review also highlights their efficacy and safety profiles, aiding clinicians in informed decision-making. Sclerotherapy, a vital modality for varicose veins, is thoroughly examined, covering both liquid and foam sclerotherapy. Foam sclerotherapy, in particular, is recognized for its improved outcomes. The review provides a comprehensive comparison of these treatment modalities, highlighting differences in technical success, recurrence rates, and cost-effectiveness. Patient preferences and satisfaction play a significant role in choosing the right treatment. Safety and potential complications associated with these treatments are explored, with a focus on minor issues and rare adverse events. This review also emphasizes the positive impact of varicose vein interventions on patients' quality of life.",2024,Jan,Cureus,16,1,e51990,,10.7759/cureus.51990,38344644,#481,Fayyaz 2024,,,0
"Provider perspectives on patient-centered contraceptive counseling for Latinas in Baltimore, MD.",Carvajal DN; Bevilacqua KG; Caldwell MT; Zambrana RE,"OBJECTIVES: To explore: 1) provider narratives of their contraceptive counseling practices with Latina patients within the context of patient-centered care (PCC); and 2) provider perceptions about the barriers to the provision of patient-centered contraceptive counseling in general and more specifically, with Latina patients in Baltimore, MD. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted 25 semistructured qualitative interviews with physicians  and nurse practitioners from four specialties who provide contraceptive care to Latinas in Baltimore, MD. We analyzed data using directed content analysis. We discuss findings with attention to major constructs of PCC, applying a reproductive justice framework. RESULTS: Providers described a contraceptive counseling approach focused on pregnancy prevention as the primary goal. Most respondents used a tiered-effectiveness approach, even while noting the importance of PCC. Providers noted health system barriers to PCC, including time constraints and insurance status. Provider-reported patient-attributed barriers included low patient education/health literacy, culturally-attributed misconceptions about contraception, and language discordance. CONCLUSION: Providers described knowledge of and intention to practice PCC but had limited integration of it in their own counseling with Latinas. Responses suggest tension between an expressed desire to provide PCC and paternalistic counseling paradigms that prioritize pregnancy prevention over patient preferences. Inequitable health system barriers also interfere with true implementation of contraceptive PCC. IMPLICATIONS: Translating contraceptive PCC into practice, especially for marginalized communities, is paramount. Training should teach clinicians to recognize systems of structural inequity and discrimination that have informed approaches to counseling but are not reflective of PCC. Institutional policies must address health system barriers that also hamper PCC.",2023,Mar,Contraception,119,,109921,,10.1016/j.contraception.2022.109921,36535412,#1467,Carvajal 2023,,,0
"Quality of life, patient preferences, and implant survival and success of tapered implant-retained mandibular overdentures as a function of the attachment system.",Indriksone I; Vitols P; Avkstols V; Grieznis L; Stamers K; Linder S; Dard M,"PURPOSE: A novel attachment system for implant-retained overdentures (IRODs) with novel material combinations for improved mechanical resilience and prosthodontic success (Novaloc) has been recently introduced as an alternative to an existing system (Locator). This study investigated whether differences between the Novaloc and Locator attachment systems translate into differences in implant survival, implant success, and patient-centered outcomes when applied in a real-world in-practice comparative setting in patients restored with mandibular IRODs supported by 2 interforaminal implants (2-IRODs). METHODS: This prospective, intra-subject crossover comparison compared 20 patients who received 2 intra-foraminal bone level tapered implants restored with full acrylic overdentures using either the Locator or Novaloc attachment system. After 6 months of function, the attachment in the corresponding dentures was switched, and the definitive attachment system type was delivered based on the patient's preference after 12 months. For the definitive attachment system, implant survival was evaluated after 24 months. The primary outcomes of this study were oral health-related quality of life and patient preferences related to prosthetic and implant survival. Secondary outcomes included implant survival rate and success, prosthetic survival, perceived general health, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Patient-centered outcomes and patient preferences between attachment systems were comparable, with relatively high overall patient satisfaction levels for both attachment systems. No difference in the prosthetic survival rate between study groups was detected. The implant survival rate over the follow-up period after 24 months in both groups was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this in-practice comparison indicate that both attachment systems represent comparable candidates for the prosthodontic retention of 2-IRODs. Both systems showed high rates of patient satisfaction and implant survival. The influence of material combinations of the retentive system on treatment outcomes between the tested systems remains inconclusive and requires further investigations.",2023,Jun,J Periodontal Implant Sci,53,3,194-206,,10.5051/jpis.2105840292,36468482,#1214,Indriksone 2023,,,0
Practice patterns in management of differentiated thyroid cancer since the 2014 British Thyroid Association (BTA) guidelines.,Maniam P; Hey SY; Evans-Harding N; Li L; Conn B; Adamson RM; Hay AJ; Lyall M; Nixon IJ,"BACKGROUND: The updated 2014 BTA guidelines emphasised a more conservative, risk adapted model for the management of low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). In comparison to historical approach of total thyroidectomy combined with radioactive iodine, treatment de-escalation is increasingly supported. AIMS: To evaluate the impact of the updated BTA guidelines on the management of DTC cases at regional UK centre. METHODS: All DTC patients were retrospectively identified from regional thyroid MDT database between Jan2009-Dec2020. Oncological treatment and clinico-pathological characteristics were analysed. RESULTS: 623 DTC cases were identified; 312 (247 female: 65 male) between 2009 and 2014 and 311 (225 female: 86 male) between 2015 and 2020. Median age is 48 years (range 16-85). By comparing pre- and post-2015 cohorts, there was a significant drop in total thyroidectomy (87.1% vs 76.8%, p = 0.001) and the use of radioactive iodine (RAI) (73.1% vs 62.1%, p = 0.003) in our post-2015 cohort. When histological adverse features were analysed, extra-thyroidal extension (4.2% vs 17.0%, p=< 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (31.4% vs 50.5%, p=<0.001) and multi-centricity (26.9% vs 43.4%, p = 0.001) were significantly increased in the post 2015 cohort. Nonetheless, total thyroidectomy (TT) remains the treatment choice for low risk T1/2 N0 M0 disease in 65.3% (124/190) in post-2015 cohort for several reasons. Reasons include adverse histological features (50.8%), benign indications (32.5%), contralateral nodules (11.7%), patient preference (2.5%), and diagnostic uncertainty (2.5%). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms a move towards a more conservative approach to patients with low-risk DTC in the UK, which is in keeping with the BTA 2014 guideline and international trends, but total thyroidectomy remains prevalent for low risk T1/2 N0 M0 disease for other reasons.",2024,Feb,Surgeon,22,1,e54-e60,,10.1016/j.surge.2023.09.004,37821296,#432,Maniam 2024,,,0
Internet search analytics for shoulder arthroplasty: what questions are patients asking?,McCormick JR; Kruchten MC; Mehta N; Damodar D; Horner NS; Carey KD; Nicholson GP; Verma NN; Garrigues GE,"BACKGROUND: Common questions about shoulder arthroplasty (SA) searched online by patients and the quality of this content are unknown. The purpose of this study is to uncover questions SA patients search online and determine types and quality of webpages encountered. METHODS: The ""People also ask"" section of Google Search was queried to return 900 questions and associated webpages for general, anatomic, and reverse SA. Questions and webpages were categorized using the Rothwell classification of questions and assessed for quality using the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria. RESULTS: According to Rothwell classification, the composition of questions was fact (54.0%), value (24.7%), and policy (21.3%). The most common webpage categories were medical practice (24.6%), academic (23.2%), and medical information sites (14.4%). Journal articles represented 8.9% of results. The average JAMA score for all webpages was 1.69. Journals had the highest average JAMA score (3.91), while medical practice sites had the lowest (0.89). The most common question was, ""How long does it take to recover from shoulder replacement?"" CONCLUSIONS: The most common questions SA patients ask online involve specific postoperative activities and the timeline of recovery. Most information is from low-quality, non-peer-reviewed websites, highlighting the need for improvement in online resources. By understanding the questions patients are asking online, surgeons can tailor preoperative education to common patient concerns and improve postoperative outcomes.",2023,Mar,Clin Shoulder Elb,26,1,55-63,,10.5397/cise.2022.01347,36919508,#1429,McCormick 2023,,,0
Effectiveness of exercise interventions to improve long-term outcomes in people living with mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Dieckelmann M; González-González AI; Banzer W; Berghold A; Jeitler K; Pantel J; Pregartner G; Schall A; Tesky VA; Siebenhofer A,"Although exercise guidelines now recommend exercise for patients with MCI, the long-term effects of exercise in patients with MCI has not been reviewed systematically. The aim was to assess (1) the effectiveness of exercise and physical activity (EXPA) interventions in improving long-term patient-relevant cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes in people with mild cognitive impairment, (2) how well the included trials reported details of the intervention, and (3) the extent to which reported endpoints were in line with patient preferences that were assessed in patient workshops. Following PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis including randomized controlled trials. A total of ten studies were included after searching in six electronic sources from 1995 onwards. There is a trend that 6 + -month EXPA interventions improve global cognition 12 months after initiation. Evidence on long-term effects of EXPA interventions on non-cognitive health outcomes could not be meaningfully pooled and the individual studies reported mixed results. Workshop participants considered freedom from pain and stress, mood, motivation and self-efficacy to be important, but these outcomes were rarely addressed. Too little information is available on intervention details for EXPA programs to be replicated and confidently recommended for patients with MCI.

Exploring patient treatment decision making for osteoarthritis in the UAE: a cross-sectional adaptive choice-based conjoint study.,Al-Omari B; Farhat J; Khan M; Grancharov H; Zahr ZA; Hanna S; Alrahoomi A,"OBJECTIVE: To assess osteoarthritis (OA) patients' preferences for pharmaceutical treatment via Adaptive Choice-Based Conjoint (ACBC) method. METHODS: A United Arab Emirates (UAE) based Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) group designed the ACBC questionnaire with 10 attributes and 34 levels. The questionnaire was developed using Sawtooth Software and analyzed through Hierarchical Bayesian (HB). Results were standardized using Z-score via SPSS. RESULTS: Study participants were 1030 OA patients, 83.6% aged 50 or older and 83.4% female. The avoidance of medication's side effects accounted for 66% relative importance compared to 6% relative importance for the medication's benefits. The ""way of taking the medicine"" attribute had the highest coefficient of variation (70%) and the four side effect attributes ""risk of gastric ulcer, addiction, kidney and liver impairment, and heart attacks and strokes"" had a coefficient of variation from 18 to 21%. CONCLUSIONS: Arab OA patients are similar to other ethnic groups in trading-off benefits and side effects and consistently prioritizing the avoidance of medications' side effects.

Association between patient choice of provider and patient-reported experience.,Kim DH; Kim B; Jang SY; Lee SG; Kim TH,"Health providers are striving to create a more positive, patient-centred experience. However, existing scholarly research about the association between determinants of patient choice of provider and patient-reported experience remains insufficient to effectively promote patient-centredness in healthcare systems. This study used a sample from the nationally representative 2020 Healthcare Experience Survey. Among the respondents (n = 12 133), 6809 who used outpatient services were selected for analysis. The variable of interest was the determinant of the patient choice of provider, and the dependent variables were patient-reported experiences (e.g. general satisfaction, experience with doctors, and experience with health providers and nurses). Data were analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model by correcting for covariates. General satisfaction was positively associated with providers' expertise factors and public image factors [providers' expertise factors: odds ratio (OR), 2.96; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.44-3.59; public image factors: OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.02-1.55] satisfied more general satisfaction. Similar results were found for experience with doctors (providers' expertise factors: OR, 4.50; 95% CI, 2.77-7.32; other factors: OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16-0.81) and experience with health providers and nurses (providers' expertise factors: OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.99-3.57; image factors: OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.09-2.14). Our study's findings suggest that to improve patient-reported experience, health providers must better manage providers' expertise factors and public image factors. Health providers can improve patient-reported experience by increasing communication skills and proper information about the nature is important. Moreover, health providers must manage public image factors comprehensively and continuously by maintaining good quality of care and to brand patients.",2023,Nov,Int J Qual Health Care,35,4,,,10.1093/intqhc/mzad093,37952091,#671,Kim 2023,,,0
The ampulla of Vater: A potential target for metastatic melanoma?,Armany D; Gosal P; Adams S,"Malignant melanomas are aggressive cancers that can prove to be fatal, with Australia harbouring the highest incidence of skin cancers worldwide. Surprisingly, as little as 13.4% of patients undergoing surgical resection of high-risk melanomas remain disease-free after 2 years, with 31.6% showing evidence of distant spread. Although rare, secondary tumours of the ampulla of Vater have been documented, with the most common primaries involving breast, renal and melanoma cancers. We report the case of a malignant melanoma of the ampulla of Vater occurring in a patient 4-year post-surgical resection of a Stage II melanoma manifesting as acute pancreatitis with obstructive jaundice. Given the rarity of secondary ampullary tumours, metastatic melanoma should always be considered in patients with obstructive jaundice and a history of melanoma resection.

A Longitudinal Evaluation of the Preferences of Patients With Advanced Cancer for Quality of Life and Survival in Malaysia: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,Yong ASJ; Lim KK; Fox-Rushby J; Ismail F; Hamzah E; Cheong MWL; Teoh SL,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to quantify the preferences of patients with advanced cancer for quality of life (QoL) outcomes versus survival extension in Malaysia. The secondary aim of this study is to explore the change in preferences over time. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was developed to include 7 attributes valued in cancer management: physical, psychological and social functioning, pain control, survival, place of death, and cost. Patients were recruited via convenience sampling from 2 Malaysian public hospitals. The survey questionnaire was administered to patients within 6 months of their cancer diagnosis with a follow-up 3 months later. Conditional logit regression was used to estimate the preference weight, relative attribute importance, and willingness to pay. RESULTS: One hundred valid responses were collected at baseline and 45 at follow-up. Respondents placed higher values on QoL improvements from severe to moderate or mild levels and to achieve home death over survival extension from 6 to 18 months. However, additional improvements (from moderate to mild) in some of the QoL outcomes were not valued as highly as life extension from 12 to 18 months, showing that it was vital for patients to avoid being in ""severe"" health dysfunction. Improving physical dysfunction from severe to mild yielded 3 times as much value as additional 1-year survival.

Patient Comfort with Before and After Photography at Plastic Surgery Offices.,Weidman AA; Valentine L; Stearns SA; Alvarez AH; Foppiani J; Long E; Lin SJ,"BACKGROUND: Before and after (B&A) photographs are a sensitive part of patients' medical records, and the use of smartphones may pose risks to confidentiality and comfort. The purpose of this study was to assess patient comfort depending on the circumstances under which these photographs being taken. METHODS: Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service and REDCap's survey manager were used to recruit survey participants. An anonymous survey was distributed to ascertain demographics and comfort in various B&A scenarios using a five-point Likert scale. T tests and ANOVA testing were used to compare groups. RESULTS: There were 411 respondents with an average age of 36.1 years old. Of them, 46% were female and the majority were White (90%) and non-Hispanic (64%). Nearly one-third had previously undergone plastic surgery, with 80% receiving B&A photography. Surgeons took these photographs 51% of the time with similar rates of smartphone cameras use (47%) versus professional cameras (52%). The public had similar levels of comfort when a nurse or a surgeon took the clinical photographs (p = 0.08). Patients were significantly less comfortable when non-medically trained office staff captured their photographs (p = 0.0041). The public had similar comfort levels with the use of smartphones and professional cameras when dressed but were significantly less comfortable with the use of a smartphone when unclothed (p = < 0.001). CONCLUSION: To ensure the best patient experience, B&A photography should be taken by a medical professional. If photographs are to be taken when the patient is unclothed, the use of a professional-grade camera may help ease patient discomfort.

Availability and use of web-based interventions for patients with head and neck cancer: a scoping review.,Kelly R; Gordon P; Thompson R; Semple C,"PURPOSE: To identify and review the nature, scope and use of web-based interventions for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). METHOD: A scoping review guided by the methodological framework described by the Joanna Briggs Institute was performed to review empirical studies and websites. Seven electronic databases (CINAHL, Medline, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane, PubMed and PsycInfo) were searched from 2010 to 2020, data extracted and synthesised using thematic analysis. The Google search engine was employed, identifying the first 100 websites, using the search term head and neck cancer. Websites meeting eligibility criteria were assessed using the QUEST analysis tool, and descriptively summarised. RESULTS: Thirteen empirical studies and 32 websites were included. As identified by empirical studies, web-based interventions were developed to provide (1) patient information on HNC and related treatments, (2) advice and support during treatment and (3) management strategies promoting adjustment to life with and beyond HNC. The reviewed websites provided minimal information to aid shared decision-making and facilitate preparedness for treatment, with few utilising patient narratives. Web-based interventions for HNC patients were mainly text based and focused on survivorship. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of theory-based, co-designed web-based interventions using patient narratives. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: As patients increasingly look to the internet for advice and support, healthcare professionals are in a position to provide high-quality web-based interventions. There is an opportunity to rigorously develop a web-based intervention, containing narratives of peoples' lives before and after HNC treatment, aiding decision-making, preparedness for treatment and self-management.",2023,Oct,J Cancer Surviv,17,5,1309-1326,,10.1007/s11764-022-01168-1,35088247,#852,Kelly 2023,,,0
Patient Perspectives on Outpatient versus Inpatient Cervical Ripening for Induction of Labor.,Watters A; Ekpe E; Okafor A; Donelan E,"Objectives Our objectives were to compare patient perceived control and experience with outpatient versus inpatient cervical ripening. Study Design This is a retrospective mixed-methods analysis of a quality improvement initiative focused on the impact to patients of incorporating outpatient cervical ripening into routine practice. Postpartum inpatients who had elected for outpatient cervical ripening (outpatients) and those who met criteria for outpatient cervical ripening but opted for an inpatient setting (inpatients) were invited to participate in the study. Patients completed the Perceived Control in Childbirth Scale, and scores were compared between outpatient and inpatient groups using Mann-Whitney U test. In addition, semi-structured questions elicited feedback prior to hospital discharge, and this qualitative data was analyzed using iterative thematic analysis. Results The study population consisted of 36 outpatients and 38 inpatients. The median score on the Perceived Control in Childbirth Scale was 69 for outpatients and 67 for inpatients (p-value = 0.49), out of a maximum score of 72 (representing the highest level of perceived control). Both groups reported similarly high levels of perceived control, regardless of cervical ripening setting. In the qualitative analysis, pain was the most common theme in both groups. Inpatients reported more distress despite access to stronger pain medications. Outpatients utilized a variety of distraction techniques and expressed gratitude for their setting more than inpatients. Conclusions Outpatient cervical ripening can be a patient-centered solution to obstetric throughput challenges arising from increased numbers of inductions. Those who underwent outpatient cervical ripening had similar perceived control to those who underwent inpatient cervical ripening, suggesting that individual patient preferences are most important in determining the optimal setting for care. The patients' reported experiences identified focus areas for process improvement efforts and future research, including improving patient education regarding expectations and innovating new pain management strategies for cervical ripening.",2024,Apr,Am J Perinatol,,,,,10.1055/a-2298-5166,38569508,#173,Watters 2024,,,0
What Features of Fertility Treatment do Patients Value? Price Elasticity and Willingness-to-Pay Values from a Discrete Choice Experiment.,Keller E; Botha W; Chambers GM,"BACKGROUND: Infertility is a medical condition affecting an estimated 186 million people worldwide. Medically assisted fertility treatments allow many of these individuals to have a baby. Insights about preferences of patients who have experienced fertility treatment should be used to inform funding policies and treatment configurations that best reflect the patients' voice and the value of fertility treatment to patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore the preferences for fertility treatment attributes of infertile women who had previously undergone or were undergoing fertility treatments-ex post perspective. METHODS: We used data from a stated-preference discrete choice experiment (DCE) among 376 Australian women who had undergone or were undergoing fertility treatment. Respondents chose their preferred treatment choices in 12 hypothetical treatment choice scenarios described by seven attributes (success rates, side effects, counselling/peer support, treatment journey, continuity of care, availability of experimental treatment and out-of-pocket cost). We estimated random parameter logit (RPL) and latent class (LC) models that accounted for preference heterogeneity. The results were used to derive price elasticities of demand and marginal willingness-to-pay (WTP) values for the treatment attributes explored within the DCE survey. RESULTS: Income level did not have a significant effect on marginal WTP for fertility treatment attributes. The demand for fertility treatment from an ex post perspective was found to be highly inelastic (treatment cost changes had almost no impact on demand). Success rates and out-of-pocket costs were significant and important predictors of individuals' treatment choices conditional on the attributes and levels included in the study. These were followed by counselling/peer support, side effects, treatment journey, continuity of care, and availability of experimental treatment, in that order. Respondents were willing to pay $383-$524 per one percentage point increase in the treatment success rate and over $2000 and over $3500 to avoid moderate and significant side effects, respectively (values are reported in AU$). Latent class models revealed that the majority of respondents (51%) were risk-averse success-rate seekers. CONCLUSION: Infertile women who had previously undergone or were undergoing fertility treatment valued fertility treatment highly as reflected by highly price-inelastic demand. Success rate of treatment and out-of-pocket costs were the most important attributes and largely determined patients' WTP for fertility treatment relative to the attributes and levels used in the study. While further research should investigate the price sensitivity of women who have not experienced fertility treatment, these results might explain why women continue fertility treatment once they have commenced despite their financial capacity to pay. Future research should also determine patients' price elasticities for a fertility treatment program with multiple treatment cycles.",2023,Jan,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,21,1,91-107,,10.1007/s40258-022-00764-7,36171511,#1652,Keller 2023,,,1
Development of a novel shared decision making aid for primary immunodeficiency diseases.,Tzivelekis S; Orange J; Poulos C; Meckley LM; Peay H; Sutphin J; Hernandez-Trujillo VP; Wasserman RL,"Aim: To describe development of a shared decision making (SDM) aid in treating primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) with immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IGRT). Materials & methods: Expert engagement and qualitative formative research informed development. IGRT administration features were prioritized using object-case best-worst scaling (BWS) methodology. The aid was assessed by US adults self-reporting PID and revised following interviews/mock treatment-choice discussions with immunologists. Results: Patients participating in interviews (n = 19) and mock treatment-choice discussions (n = 5) deemed the aid useful/accessible and supported the utility of BWS, with content and BWS exercises refined following participant feedback. Conclusion: Formative research led to an improved SDM aid/BWS exercise, and illustrated how the aid may improve treatment decision making.

Understanding Patient Perspectives Regarding Remote Monitoring Devices Following Total Joint Replacement.,DeFrance M; Lang J; Aprigliano C; Danoff JR; Nett M,"BACKGROUND: Advances in smart technology have expanded into the field of orthopedic surgery to deliver enhanced patient care. Smart technology has also raised important issues regarding protected patient information. The purpose of this study is to determine patient preferences regarding smart technology in their postarthroplasty care. METHODS: Patient surveys were administered in the office setting of 2 adult reconstructive orthopedic surgeons during a 4-week period. Surveys queried patient demographics, twelve yes/no questions, five continuous agree/disagree statements, and a single free-text question. Logistic regression and statistical significance testing were performed. RESULTS: Of the study patients, 83.6% were willing to wear a device. Women were more likely to consent to a monitoring device and have activity data collected than men (P < .05). Younger patients were more likely to consent to a device and have data collected than octogenarians. Nearly 90% of respondents indicated peace of mind with data being constantly tracked. However, 64% of respondents had hesitations about a surgically implanted device that was independent of a previous arthroplasty surgery (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients are comfortable with smart technology being involved in their postoperative care, especially younger patients and women. Older individuals, possibly with less experience using smart technology in their lives, were not as willing to wear smart devices or have their data collected. Nearly two-thirds of patients had hesitations about surgically implanted smart devices. Further investigation is needed to understand hesitations concerning smart implants as the orthopedic community enters an era of commercially available smart implants in total joint arthroplasty.",2023,Feb,Arthroplast Today,19,,101056,,10.1016/j.artd.2022.10.006,36465696,#1552,DeFrance 2023,,,0
Hartmann's procedure in rectal cancer surgery is often an intraoperative decision: a retrospective multicenter study.,Mariusdottir E; Jörgren F; Saeed M; Wikström J; Lydrup ML; Buchwald P,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate patient-related factors predicting the selection of rectal cancer patients to Hartmann's procedure as well as to investigate how often, and on what grounds, anterior resection is intraoperatively changed to Hartmann's procedure. METHODS: Prospectively collected data from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry regarding patients with rectal cancer operated upon from January 1 2007 to June 30 2017 in the county of Skåne were retrospectively reviewed. Data were expanded with further details from medical charts. A univariable analysis was performed to investigate variables associated with unplanned HP and significant variables included in a multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Altogether, 1141 patients who underwent Hartmann's procedure (275 patients, 24%), anterior resection (491 patients, 43%), or abdominoperineal resection (375 patients, 33%) were included. Patients undergoing Hartmann's procedure were significantly older and had more frequently comorbidity. The decision to perform Hartmann's procedure was made preoperatively in 209 (76%) patients, most commonly because of a comorbidity (27%) or oncological reasons (25%). Patient preference was noted in 8% of cases. In 64 cases (23%), the decision was made intraoperatively, most often due to anastomotic difficulties (60%) and oncological reasons (22%). Anastomotic difficulties were most often reported due to technical difficulties, a low tumor or neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Male gender was a significant risk factor for undergoing unplanned Hartmann's procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The decision to perform Hartmann's procedure was frequently made intraoperatively. Hartmann's procedure should be considered and discussed preoperatively in old and frail patients, especially in the presence of mid-rectal cancer and/or male gender, since these factors increase the risk of intraoperative anastomotic difficulties.",2024,Feb,Langenbecks Arch Surg,409,1,55,,10.1007/s00423-024-03237-8,38321307,#388,Mariusdottir 2024,,,0
"Patient Preferences for Long-Term Implant Care in Cochlear, Glaucoma and Cardiovascular Diseases.",Schulz S; Harzheim L; Hübner C; Lorke M; Jünger S; Buchholz A; Frech S; Steffens M; Woopen C,"In the process of developing and implementing innovative implant technologies the consideration of patient preferences can be beneficial for patients, doctors and developers. Nevertheless, in existing literature, there is still scarce knowledge of patients' perspectives on long-term implant care. In this study, three discrete choice experiments (DCEs) were conducted in the context of cochlear implants (CI, n = 92), glaucoma implants (GI, n = 21) and cardiovascular implants (CVI, n = 23), examining the relative importance of attributes of long-term implant care from the patients' perspective. The participants chose between differently shaped options for implant-related care. The attributes of these care options were generated and selected based on previous literature reviews, group discussions and a diary study with patients. The choice data were analyzed via binary logit regression. In CI-DCE, the technological compatibility of the implant with newer implant models, accessories or devices from other manufacturers was highly valued by participants, whereas in GI-DCE the (in)dependency on glaucoma medication post-implantation had the greatest influence on participants' choice behavior. In CVI-DCE, the attribute with the highest relative importance related to the means of securing long-term treatment success. In all three DCE, shared decision making was relatively important for participants. Our results emphasized the importance of an adequate transfer of technological advancements in implant care for promoting patient benefits, such as the availability of comprehensible, understandable, high-quality information about current developments. Similarly, promoting technological health literacy and further pushing the technological compatibility, durability and safety of implants are directions for future implant development in accordance with patients' preferences. Therefore, the participation of implant wearers in the development process is encouraged.",2023,Jul,Int J Environ Res Public Health,20,14,,,10.3390/ijerph20146358,37510590,#1064,Schulz 2023,,,1
Preparation for cardiac procedures: a cross-sectional study identifying gaps between outpatients' views and experiences of patient-centred care.,Fakes K; Williams T; Collins N; Boyle A; Sverdlov AL; Boyes A; Sanson-Fisher R,"BACKGROUND: To examine and identify gaps in care perceived as essential by patients; this study examined outpatients': 1) views on what characterises essential care and 2) experiences of care received, in relation to cardiac catheterisation and subsequent cardiovascular procedures. METHODS: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Surveys were posted to outpatients who had undergone elective cardiac catheterisation in the prior six months at an Australian hospital. Participants completed a 65-item survey to determine: a) aspects of care they perceive as essential to patients receiving care for a cardiac condition (Important Care Survey); or b) their actual care received (Actual Care Survey). Numbers and percentages were used to calculate the most frequently identified essential care items; and the experiences of care received. Items rated as either 'Essential'/'Very important' by at least 80% of participants were determined. A gap in patient-centred care was identified as being any item that was endorsed as essential/very important by 80% or more of participants but reported as received by less than 80% of participants. RESULTS: Of 582 eligible patients, 264 (45%) returned a completed survey. 43/65 items were endorsed by > 80% of participants as essential. Of those, for 22 items, <80% reported the care as received. Gaps were identified in relation to GP consultation (1 item), preparation (1 item) subsequent decision making for treatment (1 item), prognosis (6 items) and post-treatment follow-up (1 item). CONCLUSIONS: Areas were identified where actual care fell short of patients' perceptions of essential care.",2023,Jul,Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes,,,,,10.1093/ehjqcco/qcad042,37451699,#1063,Fakes 2023,,,0
Evaluating Policies of Expanding Versus Restricting First-Line Treatment Choices: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Framework.,Jiao B; Carlson JJ; Garrison LP Jr; Basu A,"OBJECTIVES: Healthcare payers often implement coverage policies that restrict the utilization of costly new first-line treatments. Cost-effectiveness analysis can be conducted to inform these decisions by comparing the new treatment with an existing one. However, this approach may overlook important factors such as treatment effect heterogeneity and endogenous treatment selection, policy implementation costs, and diverse patient preferences across multiple treatment options. We aimed to develop a cost-effectiveness analysis framework that considers these real-world factors, facilitating the evaluation of alternative policies related to expanding or restricting first-line treatment choices. METHODS: We introduced a metric of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) that compares an expanded choice set (CS) including the new first-line treatment with a restricted CS excluding the new treatment. ICER(CS) accounts for treatment selection influenced by heterogeneous treatment effects and policy implementation costs. We examined a basic scenario with 2 standard first-line treatment choices and a more realistic scenario involving diverse preferences toward multiple choices. To illustrate the framework, we conducted a retrospective evaluation of including versus excluding abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AAP) (androgen deprivation therapy [ADT] + AAP) as a first-line treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. RESULTS: The traditional ICERs for ADT + AAP versus ADT alone and ADT+ docetaxel were $104 269 and $206 324/quality-adjusted life-year, respectively. The ICER(CS) for comparing an expanded CS with ADT + AAP with a restricted CS without ADT + AAP was $123 179/quality-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework provides decision makers with policy-relevant tools, enabling them to assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative policies of expanding versus restricting patients' and physicians' first-line treatment choices.",2024,Apr,Value Health,27,4,433-440,,10.1016/j.jval.2023.12.013,38191022,#194,Jiao 2024,,,0
Comparative study of different combinations of mirabegron and antimuscarinics in treatment for overactive bladder syndrome in elderly patients.,Kuo YC; Kuo HC,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the therapeutic efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and patient preference in elderly patients with overactive bladder (OAB) receiving different combinations of mirabegron and solifenacin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Elderly OAB patients received mirabegron 25 mg (M25) daily for 1 month (1M) followed by randomization to receive M25 (Group 1), mirabegron 50 mg (M50, Group 2), solifenacin 5 mg (S5, group 3); or M25 plus S5 (Group 4) for further 2 months. Efficacy and AEs were evaluated. At the end of 3M, patients' preferred option for future treatment was investigated. RESULTS: A total of 168 patients were enrolled, and 100 completed 3-month treatment. At 1M, all parameters improved significantly except postvoid residual (PVR), 23 (13.7%) patients had no symptom, 16 (9.5%) had no improvement, and 10 (6.0%) withdrew from the trial. Compared parameters at 3M with 1M revealed that quality of life, Patient's Perception of Bladder Condition scores, and voided volume improved significantly in group 1; the OAB Symptom Score (OABSS) increased in group 2; mean PVR and Global Response Assessment (GRA) deteriorated in group 3; and the OABSS and GRA improved in group 4. At 3M, the AEs prevalence increased significantly in group 3. Only 38.1% in group 4 preferred long-term usage of combination therapy. CONCLUSION: M25 daily is effective and safe in treating elderly OAB patients. Dose escalation to 50 mg or shifting to S5 does not increase the therapeutic efficacy. Combining M25 with S5 provides better treatment efficacy but is associated with lower patient compliance than M25 alone.",2023,Jan-Mar,Tzu Chi Med J,35,1,62-68,,10.4103/tcmj.tcmj_209_21,36866344,#1618,Kuo 2023,,,0
A Novel Approach to Computing Preference Estimates for Different Treatment Pathways: An Application in Oncology.,Beusterien K; Will O; Flood E; McCutcheon S; Mackie DS; Mokiou S,"BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer may progress through multiple treatments with differing adverse effect profiles. Moreover, pathways may be fixed or flexible in allowing for escalation or de-escalation of treatment depending on interim outcomes. We sought to develop a methodology capable of estimating preferences for the entirety of a pathway involving a sequence of different treatments. METHODS: Patients with early breast cancer completed an online discrete choice experiment to assess preferences for eight key early breast cancer attributes. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling was used to calculate attribute-level preference weights. Preference weights for hypothetical pathways were estimated by summing the respective weights for efficacy, flexible or fixed pathway, duration, administration regimen, and adverse event risk, the last two of which were time-adjusted by multiplying each weight by the proportion of time spent on a selected treatment. RESULTS: Increases in the risk of a serious adverse event were most influential in treatment pathway preferences, followed by increases in efficacy and decreases in overall pathway duration. Patients preferred a flexible pathway versus a fixed pathway. Pathway preference estimates fluctuated in a logically consistent manner. Switching from a flexible to a fixed pathway yielded a significantly lower pathway preference. For this same pathway, when adjuvant treatment was replaced with a treatment with a more favorable toxicity profile and shorter duration, it offset the negative impact of the more toxic neoadjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This novel methodology accounts for patient preference throughout a sequence of treatments, allowing for comparison of preferences across complex treatment pathways.",2024,Mar,Patient,,,,,10.1007/s40271-024-00680-z,38491203,#234,Beusterien 2024,,,1
Denosumab versus pamidronate in the treatment of osteolytic bone metastases secondary to breast cancer: a multi-institutional analysis.,Bradley M; Nichols M; Miles B,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and most often metastasizes to the bone, resulting in skeletal-related events (SREs). Bone-modifying agents (BMAs) including denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-b ligand (RANKL), and pamidronate, a bisphosphonate, are used to prevent these adverse events. METHODS: To analyze the efficacy of denosumab versus pamidronate, we used the TriNetX research platform and compared the outcomes of pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, and overall 5-year survival rate between each pharmacotherapy. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference for an increased risk in pathological fractures (2.7% vs. 2.8%, P = 0.88), spinal cord compression (2.6% vs. 2.7%, P = 0.88), or 5-year survival rate (45.5% vs. 52.4%, P = 0.78) for the denosumab cohort versus the pamidronate cohort. CONCLUSION: Since neither therapy showed an increased risk in the adverse effects measured in this study, factors such as patient preference, financial costs, and additional side effects of each medication should be taken into consideration when choosing a therapy for bone metastases in patients with breast cancer.",2024,,Proc (Bayl Univ Med Cent),37,1,26-29,,10.1080/08998280.2023.2276623,38174029,#503,Bradley 2024,,,0
Suboptimal Clinical and Quality of Life Outcomes in Patients with Psoriasis Undertreated with Oral Therapies: International Physician and Patient Survey.,Thai S; Barlow S; Lucas J; Piercy J; Zhong Y; Zhuo J; Wu JJ,"INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, immune-mediated disease. This study assessed the time at which patients switched from a conventional oral systemic treatment to a biologic therapy; patient clinical and quality of life (QoL) outcomes associated with oral systemic treatments; and the proportion of patients who persisted on oral therapy (nonswitchers), despite reported suboptimal clinical and QoL outcomes. METHODS: This data analysis used the Adelphi Real World Psoriasis Disease Specific Programme, a non-interventional, retrospective, cross-sectional survey conducted in the USA, France, Germany, and United Kingdom (August 2018-April 2019). Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis assessed switching from oral to biologic therapy in patients treated ≥ 3 years at survey completion (n = 597). The severity of psoriasis was reported by physicians as the percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected by psoriasis. Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores were calculated for three groups: nonswitchers who met treatment failure criteria, nonswitchers who did not meet failure criteria, and switchers to a biologic therapy. RESULTS: In KM analysis, approximately 50% of the patient population switched by 24 months. A substantial portion of nonswitchers continued to have moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Among nonswitchers, 57-77% had BSA ≥ 3% and 16-24% had BSA ≥ 10% at the time of the survey compared with 37% of switchers who had BSA of ≥ 3% and 9% who had BSA of ≥ 10%. QoL was poor among nonswitchers. The mean [standard deviation (SD)] DLQI scores for nonswitchers meeting treatment failure criteria, nonswitchers not meeting failure criteria, and switchers were 6.11 (4.55), 2.62 (3.29), and 2.25 (4.23), respectively. CONCLUSION: There is a clear unmet need for more effective oral therapies, and further research into the reasons for patients remaining undertreated, which may include patient preference for oral treatments (despite lack of response), contraindications, or insurance/formulary-related barriers to access, are needed.",2023,Jun,Dermatol Ther (Heidelb),13,6,1289-1303,,10.1007/s13555-023-00927-x,37253874,#1185,Thai 2023,,,0
Demystifying Dry Powder Inhaler Resistance with Relevance to Optimal Patient Care.,Capstick TGD; Gudimetla S; Harris DS; Malone R; Usmani OS,"The selection of an inhaler device is a key component of respiratory disease management. However, there is a lack of clarity surrounding inhaler resistance and how it impacts inhaler selection. The most common inhaler types are dry powder inhalers (DPIs) that have internal resistance and pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) that use propellants to deliver the drug dose to the airways. Inhaler resistance varies across the DPIs available on the market, depending largely on the design geometry of the device but also partially on formulation parameters. Factors influencing inhaler choice include measures such as flow rate or pressure drop as well as inhaler technique and patient preference, both of which can lead to improved adherence and outcomes. For optimal disease outcomes, device selection should be individualised, inhaler technique optimised and patient preference considered. By addressing the common clinically relevant questions, this paper aims to demystify how DPI resistance should guide the selection of the right device for the right patient.",2024,Feb,Clin Drug Investig,44,2,109-114,,10.1007/s40261-023-01330-2,38198116,#412,CapstickTGD 2024,,,0
Queensland Inpatient Diabetes Survey (QuIDS): patient experience survey evaluation.,Whillier M; Hinton N; Balcerek M; MacLaughlin HL; Donovan P,"BACKGROUND: Measurement of inpatient experience can allow for treatment tailored to patient preferences and needs. The patient experience of diabetes care has not been explored in Queensland hospitals. AIMS: To investigate the experiences of patients with diabetes when hospitalised using the Queensland Inpatient Diabetes Survey (QuIDS). METHODS: In 2019 and 2021, patient experience surveys were collected as part of the statewide QuIDS, a cross-sectional study assessing the quality of inpatient care received by people with diabetes in Queensland, Australia. Patient responses were categorised and frequencies reported as percentages. Free text comments were analysed using thematic analysis methods. Pooled descriptive data were presented. RESULTS: Responses were collected from 27 hospitals in 2019 (n = 526, 52.4% of all patients with diabetes) and 35 hospitals in 2021 (n = 709, 55.5%). Overall, patients were satisfied with their inpatient diabetes care. Areas for improvement identified by surveyed patients include the choice and timing of meals, staff knowledge about diabetes and increased diabetes self-management. Access to a specialist diabetes team was also identified as being potentially underutilised. Patient comments fell into four major themes: communication, food choices, patient autonomy and education. CONCLUSION: Many patients reported positive inpatient experiences; however, patients also expressed dissatisfaction with their inpatient diabetes care. Our data provide unique insight and an opportunity to improve standards of care and service provision for inpatients with diabetes.",2023,Oct,Intern Med J,,,,,10.1111/imj.16247,37792317,#795,Whillier 2023,,,0
"Comparing Tubeless and Tubed Approaches in Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy for Moderate Renal Calculi: Outcomes on Safety, Efficacy, Pain Management, Recovery Time, and Cost-Effectiveness.",Kr S; Singh A; Sharma P; Pai V; Choudhary A; Patil S,"Introduction This study focuses on investigating the effect of routine nephrostomy tube placement in patients with moderate renal calculi of size 2.5 cm or less who undergo uncomplicated percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) procedures. Previous studies have not specified whether only uncomplicated cases were included in the analysis, which may affect the results. This study aims to provide a clearer understanding of the effect of routine nephrostomy tube placement on blood loss in a more homogeneous patient population. Materials and methods A prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted at our department over 18 months, dividing 60 patients with a single renal or upper ureteric calculus of size ≤2.5 cm into two groups: 30 patients in each group (group 1: tubed PCNL, group 2: tubeless PCNL). The primary outcome was the drop in perioperative hemoglobin level and the number of packed cell transfusions necessary. The secondary outcome included the mean pain score, analgesic requirement, length of hospital stay, time to return to normal activities, and the total cost of the procedure. Results The two groups were comparable in age, gender, comorbidities, and stone size. The postoperative hemoglobin level was significantly lower in the tubeless PCNL group (9.56 ± 2.13 gm/dL) compared to the tube PCNL group (11.32 ± 2.35 gm/dL) (p = 0.0037), and two patients in the tubeless group required blood transfusion. The duration of surgery, pain scores, and analgesic requirement were comparable between the two groups. The total procedure cost was significantly lower in the tubeless group (p = 0.0019), and the duration of hospital stay and time to return to daily activities were significantly shorter in the tubeless group (p < 0.0001). Conclusions Tubeless PCNL is a safe and effective alternative to conventional tube PCNL, with the advantages of shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, and lower procedure costs. Tube PCNL is associated with less blood loss and the need for transfusions. Patient preferences and bleeding risk should be considered when choosing between the two procedures.",2023,May,Cureus,15,5,e39211,,10.7759/cureus.39211,37223339,#1230,Kr 2023,,,0
"Two Methods, One Story? Comparing Results of a Choice Experiment and Multidimensional Thresholding From a Clinician Preference Study in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.",Heidenreich S; Trapali M; Krucien N; Tervonen T; Phillips-Beyer A,"OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of methods are used to elicit health preference information. It is unclear whether different elicitation methods produce similar results and policy advice. Here, we compared the results from a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and multidimensional thresholding (MDT) that were conducted in the same sample. METHODS: Clinicians (N = 350) completed a DCE and MDT to elicit their preferences for 4 attributes related to the medical management of subarachnoid hemorrhage after aneurysm repair. Preference weights were compared between the DCE and MDT using a complete combinatorial convolution test. Additionally, data from the DCE and MDT were used to compute preference-based net treatment values for 16 hypothetical treatment profiles versus 1000 simulated comparators. The implied treatment recommendations were compared between the DCE and MDT. RESULTS: Preference weight distributions and median weights did not differ significantly between the DCE and MDT for any attribute: likelihood of delayed cerebral ischemia (medians 0.48 vs 0.40; P = .41), risk of lung complications (medians 0.27 vs 0.30; P = .52), risk of hypotension (medians 0.10 vs 0.11; P = .55), and risk of anemia (medians 0.07 vs 0.07; P = .50). The DCE and MDT produced similar treatment net value distributions (P > .05) and implied the same treatment recommendations in 82.3% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The DCE and MDT elicited similar preference distributions and produced the same treatment recommendations for most tested cases. However, the share of people supporting the average treatment recommendation differed. More research is needed to determine how these findings would compare with those in other populations (in particular, patients) and applications.",2024,Jan,Value Health,27,1,61-69,,10.1016/j.jval.2023.10.002,37844661,#523,Heidenreich 2024,,,0
The impact of parent treatment preference and other factors on recruitment: lessons learned from a paediatric epilepsy randomised controlled trial.,Carter B; Bray L; Al-Najjar N; Piella AT; Tudur-Smith C; Spowart C; Collingwood A; Crudgington H; Currier J; Hughes DA; Wood E; Martin R; Morris C; Roberts D; Rouncefield-Swales A; Sutherland H; Watson V; Cook G; Wiggs L; Gringras P; Pal D,"BACKGROUND: In paediatric epilepsy, the evidence of effectiveness of antiseizure treatment is inconclusive for some types of epilepsy. As with other paediatric clinical trials, researchers undertaking paediatric epilepsy clinical trials face a range of challenges that may compromise external validity MAIN BODY: In this paper, we critically reflect upon the factors which impacted recruitment to the pilot phase of a phase IV unblinded, randomised controlled 3×2 factorial trial examining the effectiveness of two antiseizure medications (ASMs) and a sleep behaviour intervention in children with Rolandic epilepsy. We consider the processes established to support recruitment, public and patient involvement and engagement (PPIE), site induction, our oversight of recruitment targets and figures, and the actions we took to help us understand why we failed to recruit sufficient children to continue to the substantive trial phase. The key lessons learned were about parent preference, children's involvement and collaboration in decision-making, potential and alternative trial designs, and elicitation of stated preferences pre-trial design. Despite pre-funding PPIE during the trial design phase, we failed to anticipate the scale of parental treatment preference for or against antiseizure medication (ASMs) and consequent unwillingness to be randomised. Future studies should ensure more detailed and in-depth consultation to ascertain parent and/or patient preferences. More intense engagement with parents and children exploring their ideas about treatment preferences could, perhaps, have helped predict some recruitment issues. Infrequent seizures or screening children close to natural remission were possible explanations for non-consent. It is possible some clinicians were unintentionally unable to convey clinical equipoise influencing parental decision against participation. We wanted children to be involved in decisions about trial participation. However, despite having tailored written and video information to explain the trial to children we do not know whether these materials were viewed in each consent conversation or how much input children had towards parents' decisions to participate. Novel methods such as parent/patient preference trials and/or discrete choice experiments may be the way forward. CONCLUSION: The importance of diligent consultation, the consideration of novel methods such as parent/patient preference trials and/or discrete choice experiments in studies examining the effectiveness of ASMs versus no-ASMs cannot be overemphasised even in the presence of widespread clinician equipoise.",2023,Feb,Trials,24,1,83,,10.1186/s13063-023-07091-9,36747248,#1524,Carter 2023,,,0
Derivation of a UK preference-based value set for the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS) to allow estimation of Mental Well-being Adjusted Life Years (MWALYs).,Yiu HHE; Buckell J; Petrou S; Stewart-Brown S; Madan J,"BACKGROUND: The Mental Well-being Adjusted Life Year (MWALY) is an alternative outcome measure to the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in economic evaluations of interventions aimed at improving mental well-being. However, there is a lack of preference-based mental well-being instruments for capturing population mental well-being preferences. OBJECTIVES: To derive a UK preference-based value set for the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS). METHODS: 225 participants that were interviewed between December 2020 and August 2021 completed 10 composite time trade-off (C-TTO) and 10 discrete choice experiment (DCE) interviewer-administered exercises. Heteroskedastic Tobit and conditional logit models were used to model C-TTO and DCE responses respectively. The DCE utility values were rescaled to a C-TTO comparable scale through anchoring and mapping. An inverse variance weighting hybrid model (IVWHM) was used to derive weighted-average coefficients from the modelled C-TTO and DCE coefficients. Model performance was assessed using statistical diagnostics. RESULTS: The valuation responses confirmed the feasibility and face validity of the C-TTO and DCE techniques. Apart from the main effects models, statistically significant associations were estimated between the predicted C-TTO value and participants' SWEMWBS scores, gender, ethnicities, education levels, and the interaction terms between age and useful feeling. The IVWHM was the most optimal model with the fewest logically inconsistent coefficients and the lowest pooled standard errors. The utility values generated by the rescaled DCE models and the IVWHM were generally higher than those of the C-TTO model. The predictive ability of the two DCE rescaling methods was similar according to the mean absolute deviation and root mean square deviation statistics. CONCLUSIONS: This study has produced the first preference-based value set for a measure of mental well-being. The IVWHM provided a desirable blend of both C-TTO and DCE models. The value set derived by this hybrid approach can be used for cost-utility analyses of mental well-being interventions.",2023,Jun,Soc Sci Med,327,,115928,,10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.115928,37201343,#1190,YiuHHE 2023,,,1
An innovative approach to recruiting participants for dementia research: primary care and researcher perspectives.,Lee L; Hillier LM; Patel T; Lu SK; Lee M; Lee C,"Aim: To describe clinician and researcher perceptions of a new, patient preference focused approach to recruiting patients for research from primary care-based memory clinics. Methods: Memory clinic clinicians completed a survey and key informants completed an individual interview to gather their perceptions of this new program. Results: The majority of clinicians were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with this recruitment approach and indicated that this approach would have minimal negative impact on patient care or create conflict of interest. Key informants valued the program for its patient-centred approach, the integration of research into care and potential for increased recruitment.

Acceptability and Preference for Human Papilloma Virus Self-Sampling among Thai Women Attending National Cancer Institute.,Ploysawang P; Pitakkarnkul S; Kolaka W; Ratanasrithong P; Khomphaiboonkij U; Tipmed C; Seeda K; Pangmuang P; Sangrajrang S,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer screening is an important public health strategy to reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling is the alternative method that can potentially increase participation in cervical cancer screening. This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability of HPV self-sampling as a primary cervical cancer screening among Thai women. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at National Cancer Institute, Thailand, between March and September 2021. Eligible women were invited to collect their own samples with a vaginal cotton swab for cervical screening. The data on demographics, acceptability, and preference for HPV self-sampling were collected via a self-administered questionnaire. A Likert scale was used to assess the response of self-sampling acceptability. The multivariable logistic regression determined factors that influence preference for HPV self-sampling. RESULTS: A total of 265 participants were recruited. Over 70% agreed that self-sampling was easy, less embarrassing, and not painful. They also felt confident in their ability to self-sample correctly and would recommend this method to a friend or relative. For their next screening round, 66.4% preferred self-sampling whereas 33.6% preferred clinician-collected samples as routine screening. The factors that influence preference for self-sampling were age, marital status, feeling less embarrassed, and confidence in performing the tests. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the study participants accepted HPV self-sampling. This suggests that the self-sampling method will be an additional option to increase cervical cancer screening coverage which leads to improving the effectiveness of the national program.",2023,Feb,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,24,2,607-612,,10.31557/APJCP.2023.24.2.607,36853311,#1531,Ploysawang 2023,,,0

Patient preferences for epilepsy treatment: a systematic review of discrete choice experimental studies.,Al-Aqeel S; Alotaiwi R; Albugami B,"BACKGROUND: This review aimed to 1) identify and assess the quality of discrete choice experiments (DCEs) examining preferences related to epilepsy treatment; 2) summarize the attributes and attribute levels measured in these studies; 3) identify how researchers selected and developed these attributes; and 4) identify which attributes are most important for epilepsy patients. METHODS: A systematic literature review using PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases from database inception to February or April 2022. We included primary discrete-choice experiments eliciting preferences for various attributes of pharmacological and surgical interventions in patients diagnosed with epilepsy or the parents/carers of children with epilepsy. We excluded non- primary studies, studies assessing preferences for nonpharmacological treatment and studies that elicit preferences using methods other than discrete choice experiments. Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of studies. The quality of the included studies was assessed using two validated checklists. Study characteristics and findings were summarized descriptively. RESULTS: A total of seven studies were included in the review. The majority of studies explored patients' preferences, and two compared the preferences of patients with physicians. The majority (n = 6) compared two medications, and one compared two surgical options to continuing medication options. The studies examined 44 attributes in total, including side effects (n = 26), efficacy expressed as being seizure free or have fewer seizures (n = 8), costs (n = 3), dosing frequency (n = 3), duration of side effects (n = 2), mortality (n = 1), long-term problems after surgery (n = 1) and surgical options (n = 1). The findings indicate that people with epilepsy have strong preferences for improving seizure control, which was ranked as the top priority in all studies. Patients also have a strong preference for the reduction of adverse effects and may be willing to make trade-offs between improved seizure control and reduction of long-term side effects that may impact their quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The use of DCEs in measuring patients' preference for epilepsy treatment is accumulating. However, inadequate reporting of methodological details may reduce decision-makers' confidence in the findings.

Racial and ethnic disparities in end-of-life care for patients with oesophageal cancer: death trends over time.,Bajaj SS; Jain B; Potter AL; Dee EC; Yang CJ,"BACKGROUND: Given significant morbidity and mortality associated with oesophageal cancer, supportive, high-quality end-of-life care is critical. Most patients with advanced cancer prefer to die at home, but incongruence between preferred and actual place of death is common. Here, we examined trends and disparities in location of death among patients with oesophageal cancer. METHODS: Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Range Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database, we utilized multinomial logistic regression to assess associations between sociodemographic characteristics and location of death for patients with oesophageal cancer (n = 237,063). Additionally, we utilized linear regression models to evaluate the significance of changes in location of death trends over time and disparities in the relative change in location of death trends across sociodemographic groups. FINDINGS: From 2003 to 2019, there was a decrease of deaths in hospitals, nursing homes, and outpatient medical facilities/emergency departments and an increase of deaths at home and in hospice. Relative to White decedents, Black and Asian decedents were less likely to die at home (relative risk ratio (RRR): 0.58 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-0.60], RRR: 0.57 [95% CI: 0.53-0.61]) and in hospice (RRR: 0.67 [95% CI: 0.64-0.71], RRR: 0.49 [95% CI: 0.43-0.55]) when compared to the hospital. Similar disparities were noted for American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) decedents. These disparities persisted even upon stratifying by the number of listed causes of death, a proxy for severity of illness. Time trend analysis indicated that increases in deaths in hospice over time occurred at a slower rate for AIAN and Asian decedents relative to White decedents. INTERPRETATION: 2 in 5 patients with oesophageal cancer die at home, with an increasing proportion dying at home and in hospice-in line with general patient preferences. However, location of death disparities have largely persisted over time among racial and ethnic minority groups. Our findings suggest the importance of improving access to advance care planning and delivering tailored, person-centred interventions.

Mapping European Association of Urology Guideline Practice Across Europe: An Audit of Androgen Deprivation Therapy Use Before Prostate Cancer Surgery in 6598 Cases in 187 Hospitals Across 31 European Countries.,MacLennan S; Azevedo N; Duncan E; Dunsmore J; Fullwood L; Lumen N; Plass K; Ribal MJ; Roobol MJ; Nieboer D; Schouten N; Skolarus TA; Smith EJ; N'Dow J; Mottet N; Briganti A,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-practice gaps exist in urology. We previously surveyed European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for strong recommendations underpinned by high-certainty evidence that impact patient experience for which practice variations were suspected. The recommendation ""Do not offer neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) before surgery for patients with prostate cancer"" was prioritised for further investigation. ADT before surgery is neither clinically effective nor cost effective and has serious side effects. The first step in improving implementation problems is to understand their extent. A clear picture of practice regarding ADT before surgery across Europe is not available. OBJECTIVE: To assess current ADT use before prostate cancer surgery in Europe. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an observational cross-sectional study. We retrospectively audited recent ADT practices in a multicentre international setting. We used nonprobability purposive sampling, aiming for breadth in terms of low- versus high-volume, academic, versus community and public versus private centres. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Our primary outcome was adherence to the ADT recommendation. Descriptive statistics and a multilevel model were used to investigate differences between countries across different factors (volume, centre type, and funding type). Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with low, intermediate, and high risk, and for those with locally advanced prostate cancer. We also collected reasons for nonadherence. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We included 6598 patients with prostate cancer from 187 hospitals in 31 countries from January 1, 2017 to May 1, 2020. Overall, nonadherence was 2%, (range 0-32%). Most of the variability was found in the high-risk subgroup, for which nonadherence was 4% (range 0-43%). Reasons for nonadherence included attempts to improve oncological outcomes or preoperative tumour parameters; attempts to control the cancer because of long waiting lists; and patient preference (changing one's mind from radiotherapy to surgery after neoadjuvant ADT had commenced or feeling that the side effects were intolerable). Although we purposively sampled for variety within countries (public/private, academic/community, high/low-volume), a selection bias toward centres with awareness of guidelines is possible, so adherence rates may be overestimated. CONCLUSIONS: EAU guidelines recommend against ADT use before prostate cancer surgery, yet some guideline-discordant ADT use remains at the cost of patient experience and an additional payer and provider burden. Strategies towards discontinuation of inappropriate preoperative ADT use should be pursued. PATIENT SUMMARY: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is sometimes used in men with prostate cancer who will not benefit from it. ADT causes side effects such as weight gain and emotional changes and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Guidelines strongly recommend that men opting for surgery should not receive ADT, but it is unclear how well the guidance is followed. We asked urologists across Europe how patients in their institutions were treated over the past few years. Most do not use ADT before surgery, but this still happens in some places. More research is needed to help doctors to stop using ADT in patients who will not benefit from it.",2023,May,Eur Urol,83,5,393-401,,10.1016/j.eururo.2022.12.031,36639296,#1294,MacLennan 2023,,,0

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic expanded telehealth use. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate visit type (telehealth [TH] vs in-person [IP]) preferences and the impact of visit type on asthma outcomes among Black and Latinx adults with moderate-to-severe asthma. METHODS: For this PREPARE trial ancillary study, visit type preference was surveyed by e-mail or telephone post-trial. Emergency medical record data on visit types and asthma outcomes were available for a subset (March 2020 to April 2021). Characteristics associated with visit type preferences, and relationships between visit type and asthma outcomes (control [Asthma Control Test] and asthma-related quality of life [Asthma Symptom Utility Index]), were tested using multivariable regression. RESULTS: A total of 866 participants consented to be surveyed, with 847 respondents. Among the participants with asthma care experience with both visit types, 42.0% preferred TH for regular checkups, which associated with employment (odds ratio [OR] = 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-2.39; P = .02), lower asthma medication adherence (OR = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11; P = .03), and having more historical emergency department and urgent care asthma visits (OR = 1.10 for each additional visit; 95% CI, 1.02-1.18; P = .02), after adjustment. Emergency medical record data were available for 98 participants (62 TH, 36 IP). Those with TH visits were more likely Latinx, from the Southwest, employed, using inhaled corticosteroid-only controller therapy, with lower body mass index, and lower self-reported asthma medication adherence vs those with IP visits only. Both groups had comparable Asthma Control Test (18.4 vs 18.9, P = .52) and Asthma Symptom Utility Index (0.79 vs 0.84, P = .16) scores after adjustment.

Shared Decision-Making in Cardiovascular Practice.,Klein LW; Anderson HV; Cigarroa J,"Clinical decisions are optimally made collaboratively, with patients and clinicians working together to review all available information and treatment options. A comprehensive dialogue that identifies and brings into focus individual patient goals within the context of the evidence base is the ideal approach. Shared decision-making (SDM) is essential to making choices about treatment preferences and characterizes the optimal practice of evidence-based medicine and good patient care. By supporting patient autonomy and engagement, the patient and family become partners in their health care. Decisions surrounding whether or not to proceed with diagnostic and therapeutic procedures after fully discussing appropriate alternatives are best made considering both the evidence base and patient goals. The central feature of SDM is that a clinician and a patient engage in a dialogue to jointly make decisions, with reciprocated sharing of information that both find beneficial to reach the best decision. SDM entails much more than patient education or informed consent: there must be bidirectional transfer of knowledge, discussion of patient preference, and a process of deliberation reaching consensus. Patient decision aids have been shown to improve patient understanding of options and risks, enhance the patient's involvement, and focus their comprehension of treatment preferences. Patient decision aids also may be of value in strengthening the physician-patient relationship. The need to emphasize SDM should be integrated into the quality process at every level to make it meaningful, not an apparently arbitrary obstacle that requires discovery of a shrewd work-around. A more patient-oriented consideration of the benefits of symptom relief and improved quality of life, in addition to survival and freedom from adverse events, could only be beneficial.",2023,Jan-Feb,Cardiol Rev,31,1,52-56,,10.1097/CRD.0000000000000434,35349540,#1677,Klein 2023,,,0
Patient Preferences for Treatment Attributes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Results From a Large Survey Across Seven European Countries Using a Discrete Choice Experiment.,Fiorino G; Bent-Ennakhil N; Varriale P; Braegger F; Hoefkens E,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease requires long-term treatment; therefore, understanding patient preferences is important in aiding informed treatment decision making. This study explored patients' preferences for treatment attributes of available inflammatory bowel disease therapies. METHODS: Adult patients from 7 European countries who self-reported previous/current treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) participated in an online survey via the Carenity platform. In a discrete choice experiment, the relative importance of treatment attributes for CD and UC was estimated using conditional logit models. Latent class analysis was conducted to estimate heterogeneous treatment preferences based on patient profiles. Patients' perspectives and preferences regarding their quality of life were assessed. RESULTS: Across 686 completed survey responses (CD, n = 360; UC, n = 326), the mean patient age was 48 and 50 years, respectively. Patients with CD ranked route of administration as the most important attribute (attribute importance: 32%), preferring subcutaneous over intravenous treatment (P < .001). Patients with UC ranked route of administration and frequency of serious adverse events as the most important attributes (attribute importance: 31% and 23%, respectively), preferring oral (P < .001) and subcutaneous (P < .001) over intravenous treatment and treatment that minimized the risk of serious adverse events (P < .001) or mild adverse events (P < .01). Latent class analyses confirmed the impact of patients' sociodemographic profile on their preferences. All patients prioritized general well-being, energy level, and daily activities as the most important aspects for improvement through treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Patient preferences for treatment attributes varied among patients with CD or UC, highlighting the importance of personalized care and shared decision making to maximize treatment benefits.",2024,Mar,Inflamm Bowel Dis,,,,,10.1093/ibd/izae015,38503480,#226,Fiorino 2024,,,1
Factors Associated With Comfort Using Telemedicine for Upper Limb Specialty Care.,Tinwala H; Brinkman N; Ramtin S; Ring D; Crijns T; Reichel L,"PURPOSE: There is a growing interest in diagnosis and treatment through telemedicine because of its convenience, accessibility, and lower costs. There are clinician and patient barriers to wider adoption of telemedicine. To support the effective and equitable use of telemedicine, we investigated the patient, illness, and surgeon factors associated with the specialist level of comfort in providing upper limb care via telemedicine. METHODS: Seventy-five upper-extremity musculoskeletal specialists completed an online survey-based experiment in which they viewed 12 patient scenarios with randomized patient age, gender, diagnosis, pain intensity, and patient preference for surgical treatment (yes or no) and rated their comfort with telemedicine from 0, no comfort, to 10, complete comfort. The participants were able to provide a rationale for their stance in open text boxes. We recorded the following specialist factors: gender, location of practice, years in practice, subspecialty, the supervision of trainees, and surgeon-rated importance of a physical examination. RESULTS: In a multivariable analysis, greater surgeon comfort using telemedicine was associated with nontrauma conditions, four specific diagnoses, and patients who did not have severe pain. Lower surgeon comfort with telemedicine was associated with the higher clinician-rated importance of a hands-on physical examination and supervising trainees. Text-based reasons provided for relative comfort with telemedicine included nonsurgical treatment and facility of diagnosis based on interviews alone. Text-based reasons for relative discomfort with telemedicine included a perceived need for a hands-on physical examination and a preference for an in-person conversation for specific discussions, including scheduling surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Greater specialist enthusiasm for telemedicine is associated with personal preferences regarding the upper-extremity condition, patients with less severe pain, and a willingness to forego a hands-on examination. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Utilization of telemedicine for upper-extremity specialty care may be facilitated by diagnosis-specific care strategies and strategies for video examination, with a focus on tactics that are effective for people with more intense symptoms.",2023,Jul,J Hand Surg Am,48,7,647-654,,10.1016/j.jhsa.2023.04.006,37407147,#1093,Tinwala 2023,,,0
"Cognitive-behavioral, behavioural and mindfulness-based therapies for insomnia in menopause.",Carmona NE; Millett GE; Green SM; Carney CE,"OBJECTIVES: Insomnia is frequently reported by women during menopause due to physiological changes and environmental factors and is associated with negative daytime sequelae. Due to medication side effects and patient preferences, there is increased interest in the use of psychological treatments for menopausal insomnia. The primary objective of this review is to review the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral, behavioral, and mindfulness-based (CBBMB) therapies in treating insomnia in peri- and post-menopausal women. The secondary objective is to review the effect of CBBMB therapies on relevant secondary outcomes to gain a comprehensive understanding of their impacts. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of the literature. A search of PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted between January 2020 and March 2021. RESULTS: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia is efficacious, with corollary improvements in mood, functional outcomes and potential mechanistic factors (e.g., unhelpful beliefs). Sleep restriction therapy is also efficacious, with somewhat poorer effects on secondary outcomes relative to CBT. Mindfulness meditation and relaxation for insomnia demonstrated promise, but its long-term effects remain unknown.

Acceptability of 'as needed' biologic therapy in psoriasis: insights from a multi-stakeholder mixed methods study.,Gleeson D; Naveed M; Moorhead L; McAteer H; Sewell G; McGuire A; Weinman J; Barker JNWN; Norton S; Chapman SCE; Smith CH; Mahil SK,"OBJECTIVES: Biologic therapies have led to increasing numbers of patients with psoriasis who have clear or nearly clear skin. Current practice is that biologic therapy is continued indefinitely in these patients, contributing to a substantial long-term drug and healthcare burden. 'As needed' biologic therapy in psoriasis may address this, however our understanding of patient and clinician perceptions of this strategy is limited. METHODS: We first conducted UK-wide online scoping surveys of patients with psoriasis and dermatology clinicians to explore their views on 'as needed' biologic therapy. Using topic guides informed by these survey findings, we then carried out qualitative focus groups with patients and clinicians. Themes were identified using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Of 67 patients and 27 clinicians completing the scoping surveys, 67% (43/64) and 78% (21/27), respectively, supported the use of 'as needed' biologic therapy. Respondents highlighted advantages such as a reduction in healthcare burden and greater ownership of care. Challenges included logistics of 'as needed' drug provision and potential risks of disease flare and drug immunogenicity. Focus groups comprised 15 patients with psoriasis (9 female [60%], average disease duration 32 years [range 9-64 years]) and 9 dermatology clinicians (8 female [89%], average dermatology experience 20 years [range 8-33 years]). Both patients and clinicians felt that an 'as needed' treatment approach will deliver a reduction in treatment burden and present an opportunity for patient-led ownership of care. Both groups highlighted the importance of ensuring ongoing access to medication and discussing the potential impact of psoriasis recurrence. Patient preferences were influenced by their lived experiences, particularly previous difficulties with medication delivery logistics and establishing disease control. Clinician perspectives were informed by personal experience of their patients adapting their own dosing schedules. Clinicians highlighted the importance of targeted patient selection for an 'as needed' approach, ongoing disease monitoring, and prompt re-access to medications upon psoriasis recurrence. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that 'as needed' biologic therapy in psoriasis is acceptable for both patients and clinicians. Formal assessment of clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness is warranted, to enable the real-world potential of this approach to be realised.",2024,Feb,Br J Dermatol,,,,,10.1093/bjd/ljae068,38366988,#361,Gleeson 2024,,,0
Patients' preferences for fracture risk communication: the Risk Communication in Osteoporosis (RICO) study.,Beaudart C; Sharma M; Clark P; Fujiwara S; Adachi JD; Messina OD; Morin SN; Kohlmeier LA; Sangan CB; Nogues X; Cruz-Priego GA; Cavallo A; Cooper F; Grier J; Leckie C; Montiel-Ojeda D; Papaioannou A; Raskin N; Yurquina L; Wall M; Bruyère O; Boonen A; Dennison E; Harvey NC; Kanis JA; Kaux JF; Lewiecki EM; Lopez-Borbon O; Paskins Z; Reginster JY; Silverman S; Hiligsmann M,"The RICO study indicated that most patients would like to receive information regarding their fracture risk but that only a small majority have actually received it. Patients globally preferred a visual presentation of fracture risk and were interested in an online tool showing the risk. PURPOSE: The aim of the Risk Communication in Osteoporosis (RICO) study was to assess patients' preferences regarding fracture risk communication. METHODS: To assess patients' preferences for fracture risk communication, structured interviews with women with osteoporosis or who were at risk for fracture were conducted in 11 sites around the world, namely in Argentina, Belgium, Canada at Hamilton and with participants from the Osteoporosis Canada Canadian Osteoporosis Patient Network (COPN), Japan, Mexico, Spain, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA in California and Washington state. The interviews used to collect data were designed on the basis of a systematic review and a qualitative pilot study involving 26 participants at risk of fracture. RESULTS: A total of 332 women (mean age 67.5 ± 8.0 years, 48% with a history of fracture) were included in the study. Although the participants considered it important to receive information about their fracture risk (mean importance of 6.2 ± 1.4 on a 7-point Likert scale), only 56% (i.e. 185/332) had already received such information. Globally, participants preferred a visual presentation with a traffic-light type of coloured graph of their FRAX® fracture risk probability, compared to a verbal or written presentation. Almost all participants considered it important to discuss their fracture risk and the consequences of fractures with their healthcare professionals in addition to receiving information in a printed format or access to an online website showing their fracture risk. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant communication gap between healthcare professionals and patients when discussing osteoporosis fracture risk. The RICO study provides insight into preferred approaches to rectify this communication gap.",2024,Mar,Osteoporos Int,35,3,451-468,,10.1007/s00198-023-06955-9,37955683,#310,Beaudart 2024,,,0
"Employees' preferences on organisational aspects of psychotherapeutic consultation at work by occupational area, company size, requirement levels and supervisor function - a cross-sectional study in Germany.",Kohl F; Angerer P; Weber J,"BACKGROUND: Common mental disorders affect a significant proportion of the population worldwide at any given time. Psychotherapeutic consultation at work offers employees with mental distress short-term and low-threshold access to psychotherapeutic treatment. However, this offer is only accepted by one to two percent of the employees to whom it is offered. Taking into account employees ' preferences regarding organisational aspects might increase the use of psychotherapeutic consultation at work. This study therefore aimed to identify preferences on organisational aspects of psychotherapeutic consultation at work among employees of diverse occupational areas, company sizes, supervisor functions and job requirement levels. METHODS: A total of 755 employees were recruited via advertisements on social media (Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn). Participants rated on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to different implementation options of psychotherapeutic consultation at work: type (in-person/video/telephone), location (on/outside company premises), time (within/outside working hours), scope (diagnostic/diagnostic + treatment) and purpose (private/occupational). Additionally, the maximum accepted distance to the location of consultation was assessed. Various analyses of variances (ANOVA) were conducted to determine differences in agreement to implementation options within each organisational aspect and to analyse differences between occupational areas, company sizes, requirement levels and between employees with and without supervisor function. RESULTS: Participants indicated a preference for in-person psychotherapeutic consultation that takes places outside company premises and outside working hours. Furthermore, they preferred offers including diagnostic and treatment sessions compared to offers including diagnostic sessions only. Even though participants agreed that consultation should be offered for all purposes, agreement for occupational issues was stronger than for private issues. For some implementation options, the level of agreement varied according to occupational field, company size, supervisor function and level of requirement. However, these differences did not affect the key findings mentioned above. CONCLUSION: Those findings give practical indications on the organisational design of psychotherapeutic consultation at work. The results suggest that in-person consultation outside company premises and working hours combining diagnostic and treatment sessions will be accepted by employees regardless of their occupational area, company size, supervisor function and requirement level.",2023,Feb,BMC Public Health,23,1,347,,10.1186/s12889-023-15255-0,36797723,#1512,Kohl 2023,,,0
Endocrine Therapy for Primary and Secondary Prevention After Diagnosis of High-Risk Breast Lesions or Preinvasive Breast Cancer.,Laws A; Punglia RS,"The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice.Patients with high-risk breast lesions (HRLs) or preinvasive breast cancers face an elevated risk of future breast cancer diagnoses. Endocrine therapy in this setting reduces the risk of a future diagnosis but does not confer improved survival, thus the side effects of primary/secondary prevention must be considered relative to the benefits. Here, we discuss the available chemoprevention regimens for patients with HRLs and considerations for selecting a regimen, as well as the decision making surrounding use of adjuvant endocrine therapy for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). For patients with HRLs, available chemoprevention regimens differ by menopausal status, including tamoxifen 20 mg once daily for 5 years and more recently tamoxifen 5 mg once daily for 3 years in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women as well as raloxifene or aromatase inhibitors for postmenopausal women. We recommend a shared decision-making approach with attention to patient preferences related to risk tolerance and side-effect profiles. Low-dose tamoxifen appears to be a particularly favorable choice that is well tolerated, without risk of serious adverse events and offers comparable risk reduction to other regimens. For DCIS, the benefit of endocrine therapy in addition to radiation is small, and appears to be driven mainly by a reduction in contralateral breast diagnoses or new breast cancers. A strategy that reduces the side-effect profile of chemoprevention such as low-dose tamoxifen may be especially appealing in the setting of secondary prevention.",2023,Jun,J Clin Oncol,41,17,3092-3099,,10.1200/JCO.23.00455,37126767,#1166,Laws 2023,,,0
New biologics for food allergy.,Schuetz JP; Anderson B; Sindher SB,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to explore role of emerging biologics, including ligelizumab, UB-221, dupilumab, and antialarmins, in food allergy management. With a focus on recent developments, we evaluate their promise in mitigating adverse events during oral immunotherapy (OIT), reducing allergic reactions, and addressing the limitations of current therapeutic options. RECENT FINDINGS: Antiimmunoglobulin E mAbs, exemplified by omalizumab, demonstrate efficacy in desensitization and safety improvement during multiallergen OIT. Next-generation antibodies like ligelizumab and UB-221 exhibit enhanced potency and unique mechanisms, holding promise for food allergy treatment. Dupilumab, targeting IL-4 receptor alpha, presents potential benefits in decreasing allergen-specific IgE and modifying the atopic march. Exploration of antialarmins, specifically anti-IL-33 (etokimab) and anti-TSLP (tezepelumab), reveals encouraging results, with etokimab showing early success in peanut allergy trials. SUMMARY: Biologics hold promising potential for food allergy treatment. Tailoring therapeutic approaches based on shared decision-making becomes pivotal. While omalizumab remains a significant option, next-generation anti-IgE antibodies and agents targeting alarmins exhibit unique strengths. Dupilumab, despite limited success as monotherapy, shows promise as an adjunct for OIT. Careful consideration of treatment goals, patient preferences, and the evolving landscape of biologics will shape future clinical practice, offering allergists an expanded toolbox for personalized food allergy management.",2024,Mar,Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol,,,,,10.1097/ACI.0000000000000981,38547423,#204,Schuetz 2024,,,0
"General-practitioner-led alcohol and other drugs withdrawal: Supporting patient choice, safety and success.",Macaulay S; Grinzi P; Slota-Kan S,"BACKGROUND: Alcohol or other drug (AOD) withdrawal is a common reason for patients to seek treatment. Ambulatory, or 'home-based', AOD withdrawal for patients who are low risk is a useful intervention for general practitioners (GPs) to help empower their patients to improve their health and make meaningful change to their AOD use. OBJECTIVE: This article explores the themes of patient choice, safety and optimising success in GP-led withdrawal. The four-step framework of 'who', 'prepare', 'withdrawal' and 'follow-up' outlines how to best support patients in the general practice setting to undertake a withdrawal. DISCUSSION: There are many benefits to a GP-led, home-based AOD withdrawal. The strategies to facilitate choice and safety and to optimise withdrawal success described in the article include careful patient selection, preparing the patient using domains of whole-person care, clarifying the patient's goals and stage of change, support during withdrawal and fostering long-term treatment in general practice.",2023,Jun,Aust J Gen Pract,52,6,359-365,,10.31128/AJGP-09-22-6575,37291813,#1179,Macaulay 2023,,,0
Pharmacogenomic Testing for Major Depression: A Qualitative Study of the Perceptions of People with Lived Experience and Professional Stakeholders.,Slomp C; Morris E; Edwards L; Hoens AM; Landry G; Riches L; Ridgway L; Bryan S; Austin J,"OBJECTIVES: With increasing evidence for the clinical utility of pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing for depression, there is a growing need to consider issues related to the clinical implementation of this testing. The perspectives of key stakeholders (both people with lived experience [PWLE] and providers) are critical, but not frequently explored. The purpose of this study was to understand how PWLE and healthcare providers/policy experts (P/HCPs) perceive PGx testing for depression, to inform the consideration of clinical implementation within the healthcare system in British Columbia (BC), Canada. METHODS: We recruited two cohorts of participants to complete individual 1-h, semi-structured interviews: (a) PWLE, recruited from patient and research engagement networks and organizations and (b) P/HCPs, recruited via targeted invitation. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, de-identified, and analysed using interpretive description. RESULTS: Seventeen interviews were completed with PWLE (7 with experience of PGx testing for depression; 10 without); 15 interviews were completed with P/HCPs (family physicians, psychiatrists, nurses, pharmacists, genetic counsellors, medical geneticists, lab technologists, program directors, and insurers). Visual models of PWLE's and P/HCP's perceptions of and attitudes towards PGx testing were developed separately, but both were heavily influenced by participants' prior professional and/or personal experiences with depression and/or PGx testing. Both groups expressed a need for evidence and numerous considerations for the implementation of PGx testing in BC, including the requirement for conclusive economic analyses, patient and provider education, technological and clinical support, local testing facilities, and measures to ensure equitable access to testing. CONCLUSIONS: While hopeful about the potential for therapeutic benefit from PGx testing, PWLE and P/HCPs see the need for robust evidence of utility, and BC-wide infrastructure and policies to ensure equitable and effective access to PGx testing. Further research into the accessibility, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of various implementation strategies is needed to inform PGx testing use in BC.",2023,Jun,Can J Psychiatry,68,6,436-452,,10.1177/07067437221140383,36437757,#1215,Slomp 2023,,,0
Respiratory Management of Patients With Neuromuscular Weakness: An American College of Chest Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline and Expert Panel Report.,Khan A; Frazer-Green L; Amin R; Wolfe L; Faulkner G; Casey K; Sharma G; Selim B; Zielinski D; Aboussouan LS; McKim D; Gay P,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory failure is a significant concern in neuromuscular diseases (NMDs). This CHEST guideline examines the literature on the respiratory management of patients with NMD to provide evidence-based recommendations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An expert panel conducted a systematic review addressing the respiratory management of NMD and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence and formulating and grading recommendations. A modified Delphi technique was used to reach a consensus on the recommendations. RESULTS: Based on 128 studies, the panel generated 15 graded recommendations, one good practice statement, and one consensus-based statement. INTERPRETATION: Evidence of best practices for respiratory management in NMD is limited and is based primarily on observational data in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The panel found that pulmonary function testing every 6 months may be beneficial and may be used to initiate noninvasive ventilation (NIV) when clinically indicated. An individualized approach to NIV settings may benefit patients with chronic respiratory failure and sleep-disordered breathing related to NMD. When resources allow, polysomnography or overnight oximetry can help to guide the initiation of NIV. The panel provided guidelines for mouthpiece ventilation, transition to home mechanical ventilation, salivary secretion management, and airway clearance therapies. The guideline panel emphasizes that NMD pathologic characteristics represent a diverse group of disorders with differing rates of decline in lung function. The clinician's role is to add evaluation at the bedside to shared decision-making with patients and families, including respect for patient preferences and treatment goals, considerations of quality of life, and appropriate use of available resources in decision-making.",2023,Aug,Chest,164,2,394-413,,10.1016/j.chest.2023.03.011,36921894,#1024,Khan 2023,,,0
The Impact of Patient Preference on Attendance and Completion Rates at Centre-Based and mHealth Pulmonary Rehabilitation: A Non-Inferiority Pragmatic Clinical Trial.,Candy S; Reeve J; Dobson R; Whittaker R; Garrett J; Warren J; Calder A; Tane T; Robertson T; Rashid U; Taylor D,"PURPOSE: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is vital in the management of chronic respiratory disorders (CRDs) although uptake, attendance and completion are poor. Differing models of delivering PR are emerging in an attempt to increase the uptake and completion of this intervention. This study aimed to evaluate participant rate of attendance and completion of PR when given a preference regarding model of delivery (centre-based and mPR). Secondary aims were to evaluate the factors affecting patient preference for model of delivery and determine whether mPR is non-inferior to centre-based PR in health outcomes. METHODS: A multi-centre non-inferiority preference based clinical trial in Auckland, New Zealand. Participants with a CRD referred for PR were offered the choice of centre-based or mHealth PR (mPR). The primary outcome was completion rate of chosen intervention. RESULTS: A total of 105 participants were recruited to the study with 67 (64%) preferring centre-based and 38 (36%) mPR. The odds of completing the PR programme were higher in the centre-based group compared to mPR (odds ratio 1.90 95% CI [0.83-4.35]). Participants opting for mPR were significantly younger (p = 0.002) and significantly more likely to be working (p = 0.0001). Results showed that mPR was not inferior to centre-based regarding changes in symptom scores (CAT) or time spent in sedentary behaviour (SBQ). When services were forced to transition to telehealth services during COVID-19 restrictions, the attendance and completion rates were higher with telephone calls and video conferencing compared to mPR - suggesting that synchronous interpersonal interactions with clinicians may facilitate the best attendance and completion rates. CONCLUSION: When offered the choice of PR delivery method, the majority of participants preferred centre-based PR and this facilitated the best completion rates. mPR was the preferred choice for younger, working participants suggesting that mPR may offer a viable alternative to centre-based PR for some participants, especially younger, employed participants.",2023,,Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,18,,1419-1429,,10.2147/COPD.S408423,37465821,#1065,Candy 2023,,,0
Use of expectant management based on prostate cancer risk and health status: How far are we from a risk-adapted approach?,Spratte BN; Tan HJ; Zambrano IA; Basak RS; Filson CP; Jacobs BL; Hwang S,"OBJECTIVES: While active surveillance, a form of expectant management (EM), is preferred for patients with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa), some favor a more risk-adapted approach that recognizes patient preferences and condition-specific factors. However, previous research has shown non-patient-related factors often drive PCa treatment. In this context, we characterized trends in AS with respect to disease risk and health status. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using SEER-Medicare data, we identified men 66 years and older diagnosed with localized low- and intermediate-risk PCa from 2008 to 2017 and examined receipt of EM, defined as the absence of treatment (i.e., surgery, cryotherapy, radiation, chemotherapy, and androgen deprivation therapies) within 1 year of diagnosis. We performed bivariable analysis to compare trends in use for EM vs. treatment, stratified by disease risk (i.e., Gleason 3+3, 3+4, 4+3; PSA<10, 10-20) and health status (i.e., NCI Comorbidity Index (NCI), frailty, life expectancy). We then ran a multivariable logistic regression model to examine determinants of EM. RESULTS: Within this cohort, 26,364 (38%) were categorized as low-risk (i.e., Gleason 3+3 and PSA<10) and 43,520 (62%) as intermediate-risk (i.e., all others). Over the study period, use of EM significantly increased across all risk groups, except for Gleason 4+3 (P = 0.662), as well across all health status groups. However, linear trends did not differ significantly between frail vs. nonfrail patients for both those categorized as low-risk (P = 0.446) and intermediate-risk (P = 0.208). Trends also did not differ between NCI 0 vs. 1 vs. >1 for low-risk PCa (P = 0.395). In the multivariable models, EM was associated with increasing age and being frail for men with both low- and intermediate risk disease. Conversely, EM selection was negatively associated with higher comorbidity score. CONCLUSIONS: EM increased significantly over time for patients with low- and favorable intermediate-risk disease, with the most notable differences based on age and Gleason score. In contrast, trends in uptake of EM did not differ substantively by health status, suggesting that physicians may not be effectively incorporating patient health into PCa treatment decisions. Additional work is needed to develop interventions that recognize health status as an essential component of a risk-adapted approach.",2023,Jul,Urol Oncol,41,7,323.e17-323.e25,,10.1016/j.urolonc.2023.04.006,37149430,#1114,Spratte 2023,,,0
What Do Patients Look for When Scheduling Their Initial Elective Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Consultation?,Fung E; Cevallos P; Thawanyarat K; Rowley M; Navarro Y; Sheckter C; Nazerali R,"BACKGROUND: Multiple factors influence patients when deciding on where to seek plastic surgery consultations. Our objective was to determine the most important factors when booking the initial consultation. METHODS: A 23 question survey was distributed online via Amazon Mechanical Turk targeting participants who had prior plastic surgery consultations or were planning to have one in the future. Participant demographic data were collected, and participants were asked to rank the importance of factors related to cost, surgeon reputation, social media, technology, amenities, accessibility, and appointment details on a 1-5 Likert scale. Rankings were reported by mean and standard deviation. RESULTS: A total of 593 responses were gathered. 48.1% of participants were 25-34 years of age, 54.6% were female, 66.3% identified as White, 78.4% were located in the U.S, and 54.5% had a bachelor's degree. Participants rated the importance of a surgeon's online reviews (mean 4.15, SD 0.81), surgeon presence at follow-up visits (mean 4.01, SD 0.91), and availability of pricing prior to appointment (mean 4.01, SD 0.91) the highest. The least important factors were waiting room amenities and social media advertising. Individuals younger than 45 were more likely to rate a surgeon's social media presence higher than those 45 years and older (OR 2.02; 95%CI [1.37-2.96]; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients considered surgeon's online reviews, presence at follow-up visits, and the availability of pricing information the most important when booking a plastic surgery consultation. These findings may assist physicians in structuring plastic surgery consultations based on factors important to patients.

A role for immune modulation in achieving functional cure for chronic hepatitis B among current changes in the landscape of new treatments.,Laupèze B; Vassilev V; Badur S,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is rarely cured using available treatments. Barriers to cure are: 1) persistence of reservoirs of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and antigen production (HBV DNA); 2) high burden of viral antigens that promote T cell exhaustion with T cell dysfunction; 3) CHB-induced impairment of immune responses. AREAS COVERED: We discuss options for new therapies that could address one or more of the barriers to functional cure, with particular emphasis on the potential role of immunotherapy. EXPERT OPINION/COMMENTARY: Ideally, a sterilizing cure for CHB would translate into finite therapies that result in loss of HBV surface antigen and eradication of HBV DNA. Restoration of a functional adaptive immune response, a key facet of successful CHB treatment, remains elusive. Numerous strategies targeting the high viral DNA and antigen burden and aiming to restore the host immune responses will enter clinical development in coming years. Most patients are likely to require combinations of several drugs, personalized according to virologic and disease characteristics, patient preference, accessibility, and affordability. The management of CHB is a global health priority. Expedited drug development requires collaborations between regulatory agencies, scientists, clinicians, and within the industry to facilitate testing of the best drug combinations.",2023,Jul-Dec,Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,17,11,1135-1147,,10.1080/17474124.2023.2268503,37847193,#1082,Laupèze 2023,,,0
Time to embed physical activity within usual care in cancer services: A qualitative study of cancer healthcare professionals' views at a single centre in England.,Robinson R; Crank H; Humphreys H; Fisher P; Greenfield DM,"PURPOSE: An increasing number of people affected by cancer (PABC) are living longer lives as treatment continues to advance. There is growing evidence for physical activity (PA) supporting health in this population before, during and after cancer treatment, but PA advice is not part of usual care. This study investigates views of frontline oncology healthcare professionals (HCPs) in one NHS teaching hospital in England to understand the role of PA advice across cancer services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a qualitative study interviewing HCPs and using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four main themes were identified: 1. Awareness of the roles of PA in cancer; 2. Patient-specific factors in rehabilitation; 3. Cancer-specific factors in rehabilitation; 4. Barriers and opportunities to integrating PA within usual care. HCPs' awareness of the role of PA in cancer rehabilitation was low overall and PA was found not to be embedded within rehabilitation. Contrastingly, there was awareness of PA's potential to impact disease and treatment-related outcomes positively. Ideas for PA integration included training for staff and giving PA advice within consultations. CONCLUSIONS: Low awareness of benefits of PA-based rehabilitation and lack of integration in usual care contrasted with HCPs' interest in this area's potential. Training HCPs to begin the conversation with patients affected by cancer in teachable moments may increase patient access.Implications for rehabilitationIntegrating physical activity education and training for trainees and existing healthcare professionals workforce would help embed physical activity into routine clinical practice.Brief advice intervention training during every consultation, such as providing relevant individualised information and signposting, can be impactful.Physical activity within a broader cancer rehabilitation programme should be integrated as standard for every cancer patient.Individualised plans may include prehabilitation, restorative rehabilitation and palliative rehabilitation.Patient preferences and the patient experience should continue to shape service design.There is a need to ensure physical activity advice is consistent throughout healthcare settings and not fragmented between primary, secondary and tertiary care.",2023,Oct,Disabil Rehabil,45,21,3484-3492,,10.1080/09638288.2022.2134468,36369938,#847,Robinson 2023,,,0

Nongovernmental organizations supporting the HIV service delivery response in Africa - an engine for innovation.,Sikazwe I; Bolton-Moore C; Herce MB,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are pivotal to the HIV response, supporting access to HIV services since the start of the epidemic. Against the backdrop of the impact of NGOs, is the recognition of the unique role that local NGOs bring to the HIV response, drawing from their deep understanding of the context and knowledge of local health problems. RECENT FINDINGS: The Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ) is one such NGO. Through various implementation science research and programs, CIDRZ has supported the Zambian government's HIV response. As Zambia moves closer to epidemic control, understanding reasons for patient disengagement from care and patient preferences for HIV care demonstrated by CIDRZ have contributed to global and national HIV treatment and care guidelines. SUMMARY: This paper offers a case study for how NGOs like CIDRZ can serve as health system-wide catalyst to identify, integrate, and scale up evidence-based practices for HIV prevention, care, and treatment. It draws from the public health literature, CIDRZ extensive program and research experience and implementation science theory, to illustrate key strategies that can be deployed by local NGOs to spark innovation, quality improvement, and support governments to achieve and sustain HIV epidemic control.",2023,Jan,Curr Opin HIV AIDS,18,1,52-56,,10.1097/COH.0000000000000774,36503879,#1632,Sikazwe 2023,,,0
"Patterns in the provision of government-subsidised hormonal postpartum contraception in Queensland, Australia between 2012 and 2018: a population-based cohort study.",Carrandi A; Bull C; Hu Y; Grzeskowiak LE; Teede H; Black K; Callander E,"BACKGROUND: Short birth intervals and unintended pregnancy are associated with poorer maternal and infant outcomes. There is a risk of pregnancy during the immediate postpartum period unless contraception is initiated. This retrospective cohort study aimed to capture the current patterns of hormonal contraceptive provision within 12 months postpartum in a high-income country. METHODS: We used a linked administrative dataset comprising all women who gave birth in Queensland, Australia between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2018 (n=339 265 pregnancies). We described our cohort by whether they were provided with government-subsidised hormonal contraception within 12 months postpartum. The associations between hormonal postpartum contraceptive provision and demographic and clinical characteristics were examined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression and presented in terms of crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: A majority of women (60.2%) were not provided with government-subsidised hormonal postpartum contraception within 12 months postpartum. Women who were younger (<25 years), were overweight or obese, smoked, were born in Australia, were non-Indigenous, gave birth in a public hospital, or were in the lowest socioeconomic status group were more likely to be provided with postpartum contraception after adjusting for other covariates, compared with their counterparts.

Fostering Patient-Centered Equitable Care in Radiology: AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review.,Narayan AK; Miles RC; Milton A; Salazar G; Spalluto LB; Babagbemi K; Stowell JT; Flores EJ; Dako F; Weissman IA,"Patient-centered care (PCC) and equity are two of the six core domains of quality health care, according to the Institute of Medicine. Exceptional imaging care requires radiology practices to provide patient-centered (i.e., respectful and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values) and equitable (i.e., does not vary in quality on the basis of gender, ethnicity, geographic location, or socioeconomic status) care. Specific barriers that prevent the delivery of patient-centered equitable care include information gaps, breaches of trust, organizational medical culture, and financial incentives. Information gaps limit practitioners in understanding the lived experience of patients. Breaches of trust prevent patients from seeking needed medical care. Organizational medical cultures may not be centered around patient experiences. Financial incentives can impede practitioners' ability to spend the time and resources required to meet patient goals and needs. Intentional approaches that integrate core principles in both PCC and health equity are required to deliver high-quality patient-centered imaging care for diverse patient populations. The purpose of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to review the origins of the PCC movement in radiology, characterize connections between the PCC and health equity movements, and describe concrete examples of ways to foster patient-centered equitable care in radiology.",2023,Dec,AJR Am J Roentgenol,221,6,711-719,,10.2214/AJR.23.29261,37255040,#641,Narayan 2023,,,0
Patients values regarding primary health care: a systematic review of qualitative and quantitative evidence.,Pratiwi AB; Padmawati RS; Mulyanto J; Willems DL,"BACKGROUND: Accessible and high-quality primary health care (PHC) is fundamental to countries moving towards universal health coverage. In order to improve the quality of patient-centered care provided in PHC, a comprehensive understanding of patients' values is crucial to address any gaps in the health care system. This systematic review aimed to identify patients' values relevant to PHC. METHODS: We searched primary qualitative and quantitative studies about patients' values related to primary care in PubMed and EMBASE (Ovid) from 2009 to 2020. The studies' quality was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for both quantitative and qualitative studies and Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Studies (COREQ) for qualitative studies. A thematic approach was used in the data synthesis. OUTCOME: The database search resulted in 1,817 articles. A total of 68 articles were full-text screened. Data were extracted from nine quantitative and nine qualitative studies that met the inclusion criteria. The participants of the studies were mainly the general population in high-income countries. Four themes emerged from the analysis: patients' values related to privacy and autonomy; values associated with the general practitioners including virtuous characteristics, knowledge and competence; values involving patient-doctor interactions such as shared decision-making and empowerment; and core values related to the primary care system such as continuity, referral, and accessibility. CONCLUSIONS: This review reveals that the doctor's personal characteristics and their interactions with the patients are critical considerations concerning the primary care services from the patients' point of view. The inclusion of these values is essential to improve the quality of primary care.",2023,Apr,BMC Health Serv Res,23,1,400,,10.1186/s12913-023-09394-8,37098522,#1314,Pratiwi 2023,,,0
Patient Preferences for Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) Screening Tests.,Gelhorn H; Ross MM; Kansal AR; Fung ET; Seiden MV; Krucien N; Chung KC,"BACKGROUND: Emerging blood-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests can detect a variety of cancer types across stages with a range of sensitivity, specificity, and ability to predict the origin of the cancer signal. However, little is known about the general US population's preferences for MCED tests. OBJECTIVE: To quantify preferences for MCED tests among US adults aged 50-80 years using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). METHODS: To quantify preferences for attributes of blood-based MCED tests, an online DCE was conducted with five attributes (true positives, false negatives, false positives, likelihood of the cancer type unknown, number of cancer types detected), among the US population aged 50-80 years recruited via online panels and social media. Data were analyzed using latent class multinomial logit models and relative attribute importance was obtained. RESULTS: Participants (N = 1700) were 54% female, mean age 63.3 years. Latent class modeling identified three classes with distinct preferences for MCED tests. The rank order of attribute importance based on relative attribute importance varied by latent class, but across all latent classes, participants preferred higher accuracy (fewer false negatives and false positives, more true positives) and screenings that detected more cancer types and had a lower likelihood of cancer type unknown. Overall, 72% of participants preferred to receive an MCED test in addition to currently recommended cancer screenings. CONCLUSIONS: While there is significant heterogeneity in cancer screening preferences, the majority of participants preferred MCED screening and the accuracy of these tests is important. While the majority of participants preferred adding an MCED test to complement current cancer screenings, the latent class analyses identified a small (16%) and specific subset of individuals who value attributes differently, with particular concern regarding false-negative and false-positive test results, who are significantly less likely to opt-in.",2023,Jan,Patient,16,1,43-56,,10.1007/s40271-022-00589-5,35844011,#1673,Gelhorn 2023,,,1
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma.,Daher D; Dahan KSE; Singal AG,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), one of the most common causes of liver disease, is an increasingly common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several demographic, clinical, and genetic factors contribute to HCC risk in NAFLD patients, which may inform risk stratification scores. Proven efficacious approaches to primary prevention approach in patients with non-viral liver disease remain an area of need. Semi-annual surveillance is associated with improved early tumor detection and reduced HCC-related mortality; however, patients with NAFLD have several challenges to effective surveillance, including under-recognition of at-risk patients, low surveillance utilization in clinical practice, and lower sensitivity of current tools for early-stage HCC detection. Treatment decisions are best made in a multidisciplinary fashion and are informed by several factors including tumor burden, liver dysfunction, performance status, and patient preferences. Although patients with NAFLD often have larger tumor burden and increased comorbidities compared to counterparts, they can achieve similar post-treatment survival with careful patient selection. Therefore, surgical therapies continue to provide a curative treatment option for patients diagnosed at an early stage. Although there has been debate about the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with NAFLD, current data are insufficient to change treatment selection based on liver disease etiology.",2023,Mar,J Liver Cancer,23,1,127-142,,10.17998/jlc.2022.12.30,37384032,#1425,Daher 2023,,,0
Patient Satisfaction and Sensory Attributes of Nasal Spray Treatments of Olopatadine Hydrochloride/Mometasone Furoate Monohydrate and Azelastine Hydrochloride/Fluticasone Propionate for Allergic Rhinitis in Australia - An Observational Real-World Clinical,Fifer S; Toh L; Barkate H; Aggarwal V; Borade D; Gordonsmith RH; Wu W; Morgan C; Young K,"PURPOSE: Combination intranasal corticosteroid and antihistamine sprays are a first-line treatment option for allergic rhinitis (AR), of which Azelastine Hydrochloride and Fluticasone Propionate nasal spray (AZE/FLU; Dymista(®)), and Olopatadine Hydrochloride and Mometasone Furoate Monohydrate nasal spray (OLO/MOM; Ryaltris(®)) are currently registered in Australia. As it is not known how patients value treatment attributes of current combination nasal sprays, this observational, real-world clinical study aimed to understand patients' satisfaction with, and importance of, treatment attributes of OLO/MOM and AZE/FLU using an Anchored Best-Worst Scaling (ABWS) exercise. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Four hundred and twenty-six adults in Australia with moderate to severe AR using either OLO/MOM or AZE/FLU completed an online survey incorporating an ABWS with 11 domains: 7 sensory (immediate taste of medication, aftertaste of medication, smell of medication, irritation to your nose, urge to sneeze, dripping out your nose/down your throat, dryness of your nose/throat) and 4 treatment-related (convenience, fast acting, duration of effect, and AR symptom control). The ABWS involved rescaling individual BWS scores using anchored ratings (0-10) for most and least satisfied/important domains to create a total satisfaction index (TSI) (0-100) to be compared across groups. Statistical comparisons were completed using ANOVA (TSI) and MANOVA (individual domains). RESULTS: Participants using OLO/MOM (M = 68.26, SE = 1.39) had significantly higher TSI than participants using AZE/FLU (M=62.78, SE = 0.70) (p < 0.001), significantly higher satisfaction on 7 of 11 domains and regarded 8 of 11 domains as significantly more important compared to participants using AZE/FLU (all p < 0.05). Preferred domains were predominantly sensory attributes. CONCLUSION: Current findings showed that participants using OLO/MOM were more satisfied with their overall treatment compared to participants using AZE/FLU, particularly with sensory attributes, thus highlighting the suitability of OLO/MOM for people with AR who value sensory attributes. Prescribers of AR treatments are encouraged to discuss treatment attributes with patients to facilitate shared decision-making.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,141-151,,10.2147/PPA.S389875,36687019,#1587,Fifer 2023,,,1
Prioritizing Treatment Goals of People Diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder in the US: Best-Worst Scaling Results.,Bridges JFP; Goldberg JF; Fitzgerald HM; Chumki SR; Beusterien K; Will O; Citrome L,"PURPOSE: Bipolar I disorder (BP-I) is associated with significant disease burden, but evidence on treatment goals in people diagnosed with BP-I is scarce. This study sought to quantify treatment goals related to the pharmacological management of BP-I in adults in the US and to identify if subgroups of people with similar treatment goals exist. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A best-worst scaling (BWS) of treatment goals was developed based on available literature and input from experts and patients and was distributed as part of a survey between August and September 2021. Survey participants were adults with a self-reported diagnosis of BP-I who were recruited via an online panel in the US. Participants were asked to prioritize the importance of 16 treatment goals using BWS. BWS scores were computed using multinomial logistic regression, with the scores across all goals summing to 100 for each participant. Subgroups of people with similar preferences were identified using latent class analysis. RESULTS: The most important treatment goals for people diagnosed with BP-I (N=255) were ""being less impulsive, angry, or irritable"" (score: 9.73), or being ""able to feel pleasure or happiness"" (score: 9.54). Goals related to reducing the incidence of various potential adverse events of medication (scores: ≤4.51) or ""reducing dependence on others"" (score: 3.04) were less important. Two subgroups were identified. One subgroup (n=111) prioritized symptom-focused goals, considering ""reducing frequency of mania, depression, and mixed episodes"" and ""being less impulsive, angry or irritable"" the most important (scores: 12.46 and 11.85, respectively). The other subgroup (n=144) placed significantly more importance on social functioning-focused goals, including beginning or maintaining a relationship with a partner/significant other, and with family and/or friends (scores: 8.45 and 7.70, respectively). CONCLUSION: People diagnosed with BP-I prioritized emotional improvements. Subgroups of people with BP-I prioritized either symptom-focused or social functioning-focused treatment goals.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,2545-2555,,10.2147/PPA.S419143,37849618,#778,BridgesJFP 2023,,,1
Comparison of a full and partial choice set design in a labeled discrete choice experiment.,Thai T; Bliemer M; Chen G; Spinks J; de New S; Lancsar E,"Labeled discrete choice experiments (DCEs) commonly present all alternatives using a full choice set design (FCSD), which could impose a high cognitive burden on respondents. In the setting of employment preferences, this study explored if a partial choice set design (PCSD) reduced cognitive burden whilst maintaining convergent validity compared with a FCSD. Respondents' preferences between the two designs were investigated. In the experimental design, labeled utility functions were rewritten into a single generic utility function using label dummy variables to generate an efficient PCSD with 3 alternatives shown in each choice task (out of 6). The DCE was embedded in a nationwide survey of 790 Australian pharmacy degree holders where respondents were presented with both a block of FCSD and PCSD tasks in random order. The PCSD's impact on error variances was investigated using a heteroscedastic conditional logit model. The convergent validity of PCSD was based on the equality of willingness-to-forgo-expected-salary estimates from Willingness-to-pay-space mixed logit models. A nested logit model was used combined with respondents' qualitative responses to understand respondents' design preferences. We show a promising future use of PCSD by providing evidence that PCSD can reduce cognitive burden while satisfying convergent validity compared to FCSD.",2023,Jun,Health Econ,32,6,1284-1304,,10.1002/hec.4666,36880352,#1205,Thai 2023,,,1
Trends in the size of treated unruptured intracranial aneurysms over 35 years.,Khorasanizadeh M; Pettersson SD; Maglinger B; Garcia A; Wang SJ; Ogilvy CS,"OBJECTIVE: In the absence of clear guidelines and consistent natural history data, the decision to treat unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) is a matter of some controversy. Currently, decisions are often guided by a consensus of cerebrovascular specialist teams and patient preferences. It is unclear how paradigm-shifting developments in the detection and treatment of UIAs have affected the size of the UIAs that are selected for treatment. Herein, the authors aimed to study potential changes in the average size of the UIAs that were treated over time. They hypothesized that the average size of UIAs that are treated is decreasing over time. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was performed to identify all studies describing the size of UIAs that were treated using any modality. Scatter diagrams with trend lines were used to plot the size of the aneurysms treated over time and assess for the presence of a potentially significant trend via statistical correlation tests. Subgroup analyses based on type of treatment, country of study, and specialty of the authors were performed. RESULTS: A total of 240 studies including 35,150 UIAs treated between 1987 and 2021 met all eligibility criteria and were entered in the analysis. The mean age of patients was 55.5 years, and 70.7% of the patients were females. There was a significant decrease in the size of treated UIAs over time (Spearman's r = -0.186, p < 0.001), with a 0.71-mm decrease in the average size of treated UIAs every 5 years since 1987 and an annual mean dropping below 7 mm in 2012. This decreasing trend was present in surgically and endovascularly treated UIAs (p < 0.001 for both), in more developed and developing countries (p < 0.001 for both), within neurosurgical and non-neurosurgical specialties (p < 0.001 for both), most prominently in the US (Spearman's r = -0.482, p < 0.001), and less prominently in Europe (Spearman's r = -0.221, p < 0.001) and was not detected in East Asia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that based on the treated UIA size data published in the literature over the past 35 years, smaller UIAs are being treated over time. This trend is likely driven by safer treatments. However, future studies should elucidate the cost-effectiveness of treating smaller UIAs as well as the possible real-world contribution of this trend in preventing aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.",2023,Nov,J Neurosurg,139,5,1328-1338,,10.3171/2023.2.JNS222919,37029676,#744,Khorasanizadeh 2023,,,0
A novel framework for incorporating patient values and preferences in making guideline recommendations: guideline panel surveys.,Zeng L; Helsingen LM; Bretthauer M; Agoritsas T; Vandvik PO; Mustafa RA; Busse J; Siemieniuk RAC; Lytvyn L; Li SA; Yang M; Yan L; Zhang L; Brignardello-Petersen R; Guyatt GH,"OBJECTIVE: Universally acknowledged standards for trustworthy guidelines include the necessity to ground recommendations in patient values and preferences. When information is limited-which is typically the case-guideline panels often find it difficult to explicitly integrate patient values and preferences into their recommendations. Our objective was to develop and evaluate a framework for systematically navigating guideline panels in incorporating patient values and preferences in making recommendations. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In the context of developing a guideline for colorectal cancer screening, we generated an initial framework for creating panel surveys to elicit guideline panelists' views of patient values and preferences and to inform panel discussions on recommendations. With further applications in guidelines of diverse topic areas, we dynamically refined the framework through iterative discussions and consensus. RESULTS: The finial framework consists of five steps for creating and implementing panel surveys. The surveys can serve three objectives following from the quantitative information regarding patient values and preferences that guideline panels usually require. An accompanying video provides detailed instructions of the survey.

Infliximab vs adalimumab: Points to consider when selecting anti-tumor necrosis factor agents in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease.,Kim ES; Kang B,"Biologic agents with various mechanisms against Crohn's disease (CD) have been released and are widely used in clinical practice. However, two anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADL), are the only biologic agents approved by the Food and Drug Administration for pediatric CD currently. Therefore, in pediatric CD, the choice of biologic agents should be made more carefully to achieve the therapeutic goal. There are currently no head-to-head trials of biologic agents in pediatric or adult CD. There is a lack of accumulated data for pediatric CD, which requires the extrapolation of adult data for the positioning of biologics in pediatric CD. From a pharmacokinetic point of view, IFX is more advantageous than ADL when the inflammatory burden is high, and ADL is expected to be advantageous over IFX in sustaining remission in the maintenance phase. Additionally, we reviewed the safety profile, immunogenicity, preference, and compliance between IFX and ADL and provide practical insights into the choice of anti-TNF therapy in pediatric CD. Careful evaluation of clinical indications and disease behavior is essential when prescribing anti-TNF agents. In addition, factors such as the efficacy of induction and maintenance of remission, safety profile, immunogenicity, patient preference, and compliance play an important role in evaluating and selecting treatment options.",2023,May,World J Gastroenterol,29,18,2784-2797,,10.3748/wjg.v29.i18.2784,37274072,#1240,Kim 2023,,,0
Use of Stated Preference Methods in HIV Treatment and Prevention Research in the United States: A Systematic Review.,Rodriguez CA; Mitchell JW,"Stated preference (SP) methods are increasingly being applied to HIV-related research and continuously provide researchers with health utility scores of select healthcare products or services that populations consider important. Following PRISMA guidelines, we sought to understand how SP methods have been applied in HIV-related research. We conducted a systematic review to identify studies meeting the following criteria: SP method is clearly stated, conducted in the United States, was published between 01/01/2012 and 02/12/2022, and included adults aged 18 and over. Study design and SP method application were also examined. We identified six SP methods (e.g., Conjoint Analysis, Discrete Choice Experiment) across 18 studies, which were categorized into one of two groups: HIV prevention and HIV treatment-care. Categories of attributes used in SP methods largely focused on: administration, physical/health effects, financial, location, access, and external influences. SP methods are innovative tools capable of informing researchers on what populations consider most beneficial when deciding on treatment, care, or prevention options for HIV.",2023,Jul,AIDS Behav,27,7,2328-2359,,10.1007/s10461-022-03962-5,36809490,#1133,Rodriguez 2023,,,1
Assessing Stakeholder Engagement for Outcomes-Based Research Among Patients With Chronic Rhinosinusitis and Asthma: A Survey-Based Investigation.,Gill AS; Shipman P; Beswick DM; Howe H; Alt JA,"BACKGROUND: Despite significant morbidity, there remains a critical need for prospective analyses to investigate the impact of comorbid chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with asthma (CRSwA) on patient centered outcomes. The objective of this study was to ascertain critical stakeholder feedback from patients that could inform future study design based on patient preferences, in an effort to optimize patient enrollment. METHODS: A prospective, descriptive study was performed in order to determine the importance of various factors on CRSwA treatment among critical stakeholders. A Likert-scale survey highlighting various aspects of treatment of CRSwA and elucidating patient enthusiasm for clinical enrollment was constructed and prospectively administered to patients with CRSwA. A univariate analysis was instituted to understand the significance of the different trial design preferences. RESULTS: Survey responses were collected from a total of 17 patients with CRSwA. With Likert scores >4/5, responses indicated significant stakeholder interest in research focused on understanding symptom triggers, including the impact of air quality and allergens. Importantly, the highest mean scores noted were for studies focused on improving (1) overall quality of life (4.8/5) and (2) lung function (4.8/5). Patients appeared least interested in participation in a randomized trial, whereas the greatest support was communicated for a purely observational trial (P = .08). CONCLUSION: Patients with CRSwA demonstrate enthusiasm for participation in research that focuses on improving patient centered outcomes-specifically quality of life and lung function. Stakeholder feedback also indicates a preference for observational study design over randomized control trials.",2023,Aug,Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,132,8,926-929,,10.1177/00034894221129329,36226327,#1032,Gill 2023,,,0
Utilization of Hospital Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders in Older Adults During COVID-19 Surges in 2020.,Mehta AB; Douglas IS; Battaglia C; Wynia MK,"Background: Reports of poor outcomes among older adults with COVID-19 may have changed patient perceptions of Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) orders or caused providers to pressure older adults into accepting DNR orders to conserve resources. Objective: We determined early-DNR utilization during COVID-19 surges compared with nonsurge periods among nonsurgical adults ≥75 and its connection to hospital mortality. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among adults ≥75 years using the California Patient Discharge Database 2020. The primary outcome was early-DNR utilization. Control cohorts included nonsurgical adults <75 years in 2020 and nonsurgical adults ≥75 in 2019. Multiple causal inference methods were used to address measured and unmeasured confounding. Results: A total of 487,955 adults ≥75 years were identified, with 233,678 admitted during COVID-19 surges. Older adults admitted during surges had higher rates of early-DNR orders (30.1% vs. 29.4%, absolute risk differences = 0.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5-1.0) even after adjusting for patient case-mix (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.04). Patients with early-DNR orders experienced higher hospital mortality (15.5% vs. 4.8%, aOR = 3.96, 95% CI: 3.85-4.06). Difference-in-difference analyses demonstrated that adults <75 years in 2020 and adults ≥75 years in 2019 did not experience variation in early-DNR utilization. Conclusions: Older adults had slightly higher rates of early-DNR orders during COVID-19 surges compared with nonsurge periods. While the difference in early-DNR utilization was small, it was linked to higher odds of death. The increase in early-DNR use only during COVID-19 surges and only among older adults may reflect changes in patient preferences or increased pressure on older adults stemming from provider fears of rationing during COVID-19 surges.",2024,Feb,J Palliat Med,27,2,201-208,,10.1089/jpm.2023.0277,37616551,#437,Mehta 2024,,,0
"A cross-sectional study on factors influencing patient participation in undergraduate medical education in a public and private hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa.",Makins N; Naidoo T; Hassim T; Babalola O; Dormehl C; Mkhabela R; Degni L; Motloutsi KL; Mokhachane M,"BACKGROUND: The active involvement of patients in medical education is a common practice globally. Despite this, there is a global paucity of data on patients' views on their role in medical education. As such this study aimed to identify factors that influence patient participation in undergraduate medical education in public and private hospitals in Johannesburg. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted, using a 23-question, self-designed, paper questionnaire to collect data on patients' perceptions of student involvement in their care - with regard to consent, confidentiality, ethics, and patient preferences. Participants were recruited on a voluntary basis in the Departments of Medicine, Surgery, and Gynaecology, at selected hospital sites. Fisher's Exact and Chi-Square statistical tests were used where appropriate. RESULTS: Two hundred and one adult patients, comprised of 150 public sector patients and 51 private sector patients, completed the questionnaire. One hundred and sixty-nine patients (84,1%) were willing to participate in undergraduate medical education and no notable difference between these sectors was demonstrated (p = 0,41). The results further demonstrated that the main factors influencing patient participation in undergraduate medical education across both sectors were (1) the presence of a supervising professional, (2) the perceived degree of invasiveness of a procedure, and (3) the perceived expertise of the student. In addition, data across other key themes such as consent, confidentiality, ethics, and patient preferences and perceptions were elucidated. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the majority of inpatients across the public and private sectors are willing to participate in undergraduate medical education to facilitate the development of healthcare professionals. It also demonstrated that most patients have a positive experience. However, more measures of quality informed consent need to be instituted to optimise the current role of the South African public health sector, whilst facilitating the development of a similar role for the South African private sector in future clinical education. In addition, further research is necessary to evaluate these findings in a South African context.",2023,Sep,BMC Med Educ,23,1,687,,10.1186/s12909-023-04663-w,37735370,#865,Makins 2023,,,0
Optimizing care delivery in expanding health systems: Views from clinical leaders.,Diaz A; Chhabra KR; Byrnes ME; Rajkumar A; Yang P; Ibrahim A; Dimick JB; Nathan H,"INTRODUCTION: In response to intense market pressures, many hospitals have consolidated into systems. However, evidence suggests that consolidation has not led to the improvements in clinical quality promised by proponents of mergers. The challenges to delivering care within expanding health systems and the opportunities posed to surgical leaders remains largely unexplored. METHODS: Semistructured interviews with 30 surgical leaders at teaching hospitals affiliated with health systems from August-December 2019. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded in an iterative process using MaxQDA software. Attitudes and strategies toward redesigning health care delivery across expanding systems were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Leaders reported challenges to redesigning care delivery across the system ranging from resource constraints (e.g. hospital beds and operating rooms) to evolving market demands (e.g., patient preferences to receive care close to home). However, participants also highlighted that system expansion provided multiple opportunities to increase access (e.g. decant low-complexity care to affiliated centers) and improve quality of care (e.g. standardize best practices) for diverse populations including the potential to leverage their health system to expand access and improve quality. CONCLUSIONS: Though evidence suggests that hospital consolidation has not led to redesigned care delivery or improved clinical quality at a national level, leaders are pursuing varying sets of strategies aimed at leveraging system expansion in order to improve access and quality of care.",2023,Dec,Healthc (Amst),11,4,100722,,10.1016/j.hjdsi.2023.100722,38000229,#598,Diaz 2023,,,0
Comparative efficacy of treatments for molluscum contagiosum: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.,Chao YC; Ko MJ; Tsai WC; Hsu LY; Wu HY,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Various interventions have been applied to treat molluscum contagiosum, but benefits and efficacy remain unclear. To assess the comparative efficacy and safety of interventions for molluscum contagiosum, a network meta-analysis was performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library were searched for articles published between January 1, 1990, and November 31, 2020. Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of interventions in immunocompetent children and adults with genital/non-genital molluscum contagiosum lesions. RESULTS: Twelve interventions from 25 RCTs including 2,123 participants were assessed. Compared with the placebo, ingenol mebutate had the most significant effect on complete clearance (odds ratio [OR] 117.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.37-2164.88), followed by cryotherapy (OR 16.81, 95% CI 4.13-68.54), podophyllotoxin (OR 10.24, 95% CI 3.36-31.21), and potassium hydroxide (KOH) (OR 10.02, 95% CI 4.64-21.64). Data on adverse effects were too scarce for quantitative synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Ingenol mebutate, cryotherapy, podophyllotoxin, and KOH were more effective than the other interventions in achieving complete clearance, but safety concerns regarding ingenol mebutate have recently been reported. Due to the possibility of spontaneous resolution, observation is also justified for asymptomatic infection. Factors including adverse effects, cost, patient preference, and medical accessibility should be considered.",2023,Jun,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,21,6,587-597,,10.1111/ddg.15063,37199262,#1191,Chao 2023,,,0

Available data show a significant number of opioid deaths, primarily associated with illicit fentanyl use. It is interesting to also note that the data show no clear correlation between opioid prescribing (either number of prescriptions or morphine milligram equivalent [MME] per capita), opioid hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, the data suggest that the 2016 guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have resulted in notable problems including increased hospitalizations and mental health disorders due to the lack of appropriate opioid prescribing as well as inaptly rapid tapering or weaning processes. Consequently, when examined in light of other policies and complications caused by COVID-19, a fourth wave of the opioid epidemic has been emerging. OBJECTIVES: In light of this, we herein seek to provide guidance for the prescription of opioids for the management of chronic non-cancer pain. These clinical practice guidelines are based upon a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological evidence and have been developed by a panel of multidisciplinary experts assessing the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations and offer a clear explanation of logical relationships between various care options and health outcomes. METHODS: The methods utilized included the development of objectives and key questions for the various facets of opioid prescribing practice. Also utilized were employment of trustworthy standards, and appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest(s). The literature pertaining to opioid use, abuse, effectiveness, and adverse consequences was reviewed. The recommendations were developed after the appropriate review of text and questions by a panel of multidisciplinary subject matter experts, who tabulated comments, incorporated changes, and developed focal responses to questions posed. The multidisciplinary panel finalized 20 guideline recommendations for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Summary of the results showed over 90% agreement for the final 20 recommendations with strong consensus. The consensus guidelines included 4 sections specific to opioid therapy with 1) ten recommendations particular to initial steps of opioid therapy; 2) five recommendations for assessment of effectiveness of opioid therapy; 3) three recommendations regarding monitoring adherence and side effects; and 4) two general, final phase recommendations. LIMITATIONS: There is a continued paucity of literature of long-term opioid therapy addressing chronic non-cancer pain. Further, significant biases exist in the preparation of guidelines, which has led to highly variable rules and regulations across various states. CONCLUSION: These guidelines were developed based upon a comprehensive review of the literature, consensus among expert panelists, and in alignment with patient preferences, and shared decision-making so as to improve the long-term pain relief and function in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. Consequently, it was concluded - and herein recommended - that chronic opioid therapy should be provided in low doses with appropriate adherence monitoring and understanding of adverse events only to those patients with a proven medical necessity, and who exhibit stable improvement in both pain relief and activities of daily function, either independently or in conjunction with other modalities of treatments.",2023,Dec,Pain Physician,26,7S,S7-S126,,,38117465,#591,Manchikanti 2023,,,0
"""I'd rather wait and see what's around the corner"": A multi-perspective qualitative study of treatment escalation planning in frailty.",Lound A; Bruton J; Jones K; Shah N; Williams B; Gross J; Post B; Day S; Brett SJ; Ward H,"INTRODUCTION: People living with frailty risk adverse outcomes following even minor illnesses. Admission to hospital or the intensive care unit is associated with potentially burdensome interventions and poor outcomes. Decision-making during an emergency is fraught with complexity and potential for conflict between patients, carers and clinicians. Advance care planning is a process of shared decision-making which aims to ensure patients are treated in line with their wishes. However, planning for future care is challenging and those living with frailty are rarely given the opportunity to discuss their preferences. The aim of the ProsPECT (Prospective Planning for Escalation of Care and Treatment) study was to explore perspectives on planning for treatment escalation in the context of frailty. We spoke to people living with frailty, their carers and clinicians across primary and secondary care. METHODS: In-depth online or telephone interviews and online focus groups. The topic guide explored frailty, acute decision-making and planning for the future. Data were thematically analysed using the Framework Method. Preliminary findings were presented to a sample of study participants for feedback in two online workshops. RESULTS: We spoke to 44 participants (9 patients, 11 carers and 24 clinicians). Four main themes were identified: frailty is absent from treatment escalation discussions, planning for an uncertain future, escalation in an acute crisis is 'the path of least resistance', and approaches to facilitating treatment escalation planning in frailty. CONCLUSION: Barriers to treatment escalation planning include a lack of shared understanding of frailty and uncertainty about the future. Emergency decision-making is focussed on survival or risk aversion and patient preferences are rarely considered. To improve planning discussions, we recommend frailty training for non-specialist clinicians, multi-disciplinary support, collaborative working between patients, carers and clinicians as well as broader public engagement.",2023,,PLoS One,18,9,e0291984,,10.1371/journal.pone.0291984,37733669,#867,Lound 2023,,,0
Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis and Small Aortic Annulus: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,Rodés-Cabau J; Ribeiro HB; Mohammadi S; Serra V; Al-Atassi T; Iñiguez A; Vilalta V; Nombela-Franco L; Sáez de Ibarra Sánchez JI; Auffret V; Forcillo J; Conradi L; Urena M; Moris C; Muñoz-Garcia A; Paradis JM; Dumont E; Kalavrouziotis D; Maria Pomerantzeff P; Rosa VEE; Pezzute Lopes M; Sureda C; Diaz VAJ; Giuliani C; Avvedimento M; Pelletier-Beaumont E; Pibarot P,"BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment in patients with severe aortic stenosis and small aortic annulus (SAA) remains to be determined. This study aimed to compare the hemodynamic and clinical outcomes between transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with a SAA. METHODS: This prospective multicenter international randomized trial was performed in 15 university hospitals. Participants were 151 patients with severe aortic stenosis and SAA (mean diameter <23 mm) randomized (1:1) to TAVR (n=77) versus SAVR (n=74). The primary outcome was impaired valve hemodynamics (ie, severe prosthesis patient mismatch or moderate-severe aortic regurgitation) at 60 days as evaluated by Doppler echocardiography and analyzed in a central echocardiography core laboratory. Clinical events were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 75.5±5.1 years, with 140 (93%) women, a median Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality of 2.50% (interquartile range, 1.67%-3.28%), and a median annulus diameter of 21.1 mm (interquartile range, 20.4-22.0 mm). There were no differences between groups in the rate of severe prosthesis patient mismatch (TAVR, 4 [5.6%]; SAVR, 7 [10.3%]; P=0.30) and moderate-severe aortic regurgitation (none in both groups). No differences were found between groups in mortality rate (TAVR, 1 [1.3%]; SAVR, 1 [1.4%]; P=1.00) and stroke (TAVR, 0; SAVR, 2 [2.7%]; P=0.24) at 30 days. After a median follow-up of 2 (interquartile range, 1-4) years, there were no differences between groups in mortality rate (TAVR, 7 [9.1%]; SAVR, 6 [8.1%]; P=0.89), stroke (TAVR, 3 [3.9%]; SAVR, 3 [4.1%]; P=0.95), and cardiac hospitalization (TAVR, 15 [19.5%]; SAVR, 15 [20.3%]; P=0.80). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe aortic stenosis and SAA (women in the majority), there was no evidence of superiority of contemporary TAVR versus SAVR in valve hemodynamic results. After a median follow-up of 2 years, there were no differences in clinical outcomes between groups. These findings suggest that the 2 therapies represent a valid alternative for treating patients with severe aortic stenosis and SAA, and treatment selection should likely be individualized according to baseline characteristics, additional anatomical risk factors, and patient preference. However, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution because of the limited sample size leading to an underpowered study, and need to be confirmed in future larger studies.

Management of mixed urinary incontinence: IUGA committee opinion.,Jha S; Jeppson PC; Dokmeci F; Marquini GV; Sartori MGF; Moalli P; Malik SA,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) is defined by the International Urogynecology Association (IUGA) and International Continence Society as the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine associated with urgency and also with exertion, effort, sneezing or coughing. It therefore implies the coexistence of both stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). MUI is a heterogeneous diagnosis that requires an assessment of its individual components of SUI and UUI. Management requires an individualised approach to the symptom components. The aim of this review is to identify the assessment/investigations and management options for MUI. METHODS: A working subcommittee from the IUGA Research & Development (R&D) Committee was created and volunteers invited from the IUGA membership. A literature review was performed to provide guidance focused on the recommended assessment and management of MUI. The document was then evaluated by the entire IUGA R&D Committee and IUGA Board of Directors and revisions made. The final document represents the IUGA R&D Committee Opinion. RESULTS: The R&D Committee MUI opinion paper provides guidance on the assessment and management of women with MUI and summarises the evidence-based recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Mixed urinary incontinence is a complex problem and successful management requires alleviation of both the stress and urge components. Care should be individualised based on patient preferences. Further research is needed to guide patients in setting goals and to determine which component of MUI to treat first. The evidence for many of the surgical/procedural treatment options for MUI are limited and needs to be explored in more detail.",2024,Feb,Int Urogynecol J,35,2,291-301,,10.1007/s00192-023-05694-z,38252279,#408,Jha 2024,,,0
Patients' preferences for systemic treatment of atopic dermatitis: safety and efficacy count the most.,Schaarschmidt ML; Kromer D; Wellmann P; Peitsch WK; Kromer C,"BACKGROUND: The advent of biologics and janus kinase inhibitors has revolutionized treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate preferences of patients with AD for attributes of currently approved systemic treatments and assess influencing factors. METHODS: An online discrete choice experiment was conducted in patients with AD throughout Germany to analyze preferences for outcome (probability of (almost) clear skin at week 16, probability of significant itch improvement, time to onset of itch relief and type of side effects) and process attributes (application method and frequency of laboratory tests). RESULTS: Participants (n = 182, 75.3% female) considered side effects (Relative Importance Score (RIS): 31.2), (almost) clear skin (RIS: 24.2) and probability of itch improvement (RIS: 16.0) most important. Application method (RIS: 14.4), time to onset of itch relief (RIS: 7.4) and frequency of laboratory tests (RIS: 6.8) were less relevant. Preferences were significantly influenced by sex, age, psychiatric comorbidity, current therapy and health-related quality of life according to multivariate regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Participants attached great importance to safety and symptom control. However, preferences were also dependent on individual characteristics, underscoring the importance of personal counseling. Conjoined with medical considerations, patients' preferences have fundamental impact on shared decisions for treatment of AD.",2024,Dec,J Dermatolog Treat,35,1,2308682,,10.1080/09546634.2024.2308682,38297480,#162,Schaarschmidt 2024,,,1
Patient experiences of undergoing abortion with and without an ultrasound scan in Britain.,Blaylock R; Lohr PA; Hoggart L; Lowe P,"BACKGROUND: Routine ultrasound scanning to determine gestational age and pregnancy location has long been part of pre-abortion assessment in Britain, despite not being legally required or recommended in national clinical guidelines. To support implementation of fully telemedical abortion care (implemented in Britain in April 2020), the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) issued clinical guidance for an 'as-indicated' approach to pre-abortion ultrasound, removing the need for a clinic visit. We aimed to understand patient experiences of ultrasound in abortion care by conducting a qualitative study with individuals who had abortions with and without an ultrasound scan. METHODS: Between November 2021 and July 2022, we recruited patients who had a medical abortion at home without a pre-procedure ultrasound at 69 days' gestation or less at British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), and also had at least one other abortion with an ultrasound from any provider in Britain. We conducted interviews using a semi-structured interview guide to explore our participants' experiences and conducted reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: We recruited 24 participants and included 19 interviews in our analysis. We developed three themes from our data. These were 'Ultrasound scans and their relationship with autonomy and decision-making', 'Intrusive and out of place: the ultrasound as an inappropriate technology' and 'Towards preference-centred, quality care'. CONCLUSIONS: Further research and user-testing of strategies to improve the scan experience should be undertaken. Patient testimonies on the negative impact of ultrasound scans in abortion care should reassure providers that omitting them according to patient preference is a positive step towards providing patient-centred care.",2024,Feb,BMJ Sex Reprod Health,,,,,10.1136/bmjsrh-2023-202116,38365453,#364,Blaylock 2024,,,0
Exercise Preferences in Young Adults with Cancer-The YOUEX Study.,Voland A; Krell V; Götte M; Niels T; Köppel M; Wiskemann J,"(1) Background: Strong evidence supports the persuasive positive effects of exercise for cancer patients and survivors. Different approaches of exercise programs have been established; however, the special interests of young adults (YAs) with cancer have rarely been considered in exercise interventions. Therefore, the study YOUng EXercisers (YOUEX) aimed to investigate exercise preferences in YAs. (2) Methods: YOUEX was a three-arm, patient preference-based non-randomized, longitudinal, pre-post exercise intervention, offering three different exercise modules to YAs during or after acute therapy (Module 1: online supervised group-based (M1); Module 2: online unsupervised (M2); Module 3: in-person supervised (M3)). The intervention period was 12 weeks with another 12-week follow-up period, the modules could be changed or amended after 6 and 12 weeks. (3) Results: 92 YAs were allocated to the study. At baseline, 50 YAs (54%) chose M2, 32 YAs (35%) M1 and 10 YAs (11%) M3. The analysis revealed high acceptability and feasibility of the online exercise programs (M1, M2). There was a high impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the execution of M3. YAs showed diverse preferences in module selection due to differences in, e.g., cancer therapy status or favored level of supervision. (4) Conclusions: YAs need personalized exercise programs that consider their individual interests and needs. Online exercise programs can be a promising addition to existing exercise opportunities. They are an effective way to increase physical activity levels in YAs.",2023,Jan,Curr Oncol,30,2,1473-1487,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT05613699,10.3390/curroncol30020113,36826074,#1580,Voland 2023,,,0

Limb salvage versus primary amputation in Gustilo-Anderson IIIB and IIIC tibial fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Ng HJH; Ang EJG; Premchand AXR; Rajaratnam V,"INTRODUCTION: The last systematic review on this topic was published in 2008. With advances in surgical techniques, patients with mangled extremities may now be potentially salvageable with comparable outcomes. This review aims to evaluate the outcomes of limb salvage compared to primary amputation in patients with severe open tibial fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search on PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, CENTRAL and CINAHL was performed from inception to 19 January 2022. The primary outcome was to evaluate clinical and functional outcomes. Secondary outcomes were to evaluate pain, patient preference, quality of life, and patient preferences. Methodological quality was evaluated using the MINORS criteria. Pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used as a summary statistic for dichotomous variables and continuous variables, respectively. RESULTS: Sixteen studies with 645 patients met inclusion criteria. The methodological quality was moderate based on the MINORS score. The majority were male. Mean age was 36.3 years. There was no significant differences in the length of hospitalization (n = 8), return to work rates (n = 9), return to sport rates (n = 4) and quality of life scores (n = 4). Patients with primary amputation had a significantly lower risk of total complications (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.08-0.53, p = 0.001) (n = 10), infections (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.85, p = 0.01) (n = 9), and number of surgeries (MD - 4.17, 95% CI - 6.49 to - 1.85, p = 0.0004) (n = 6). Patients with primary amputation were able to ambulate significantly earlier (MD - 4.06, 95% CI - 7.65 to - 0.46, p = 0.03) (n = 3). Three studies found a significantly higher cost of hospitalization in limb salvage patients. Functional outcomes were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: While patients with primary amputation had better clinical outcomes in the short-term, functional outcomes were not significantly different in both groups. Despite the heterogenicity of the results in this review, surgeons need to contextualize the decision making for their patients and incorporate these findings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

Patients' and informal caregivers' perspectives on self-management interventions for type 2 diabetes mellitus outcomes: a mixed-methods overview of 14 years of reviews.,Niño-de-Guzman Quispe E; Bracchiglione J; Ballester M; Groene O; Heijmans M; Martínez García L; Noordman J; Orrego C; Rocha C; Suñol R; Alonso-Coello P,"BACKGROUND: Self-management interventions (SMIs) are core components of high-quality care in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to identify and summarise the scientific evidence exploring the perspectives of patients with T2DM and their informal caregivers on outcomes of SMIs, and the key themes to enhance T2DM patient-centred care. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods overview of reviews. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, up to June 2021 for systematic reviews (SRs) exploring the perspectives of adults with T2DM and their informal caregivers, regarding self-management. Two reviewers conducted independently study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. We estimated the degree of overlap across SRs. We performed a qualitative analysis using a thematic synthesis approach. RESULTS: We identified 54 SRs, corresponding to 939 studies, with a slight overlap. Most SRs (47/54, 87%) were considered high quality. We developed summaries for 22 outcomes and identified six overarching themes: (1) diabetic identity; (2) accessing healthcare; (3) experience of care; (4) engagement with self-management; (5) outcomes awareness; and (6) challenges adhering to self-management. We found important variability in how patients with T2DM and their informal caregivers value critical outcomes influenced by the disease progression and several contextual factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings represent what matters most to patients with T2DM and their informal caregivers regarding outcomes of SMIs. Our results can facilitate the development and evaluation of SMIs, and guide decision-making in diabetes care, including the formulation of decisions and recommendations.",2023,Aug,Arch Public Health,81,1,140,,10.1186/s13690-023-01153-9,37537669,#990,Niño-de-GuzmanQuispe 2023,,,0
Consumer preferences for telehealth in Australia: A discrete choice experiment.,Savira F; Robinson S; Toll K; Spark L; Thomas E; Nesbitt J; Frean I; Norman R,"This study aims to elicit consumer preferences regarding telehealth and face-to-face consultations in Australia. It used a discrete choice experiment, presenting participants with a series of hypothetical choices, and based on their responses, infer what is most important to them. Data were analysed using conditional logit regression and latent class analysis. A total of 1,025 participants completed the survey, considering four different clinical scenarios. Face-to-face contacts were, on average, preferred to either telephone or video services. However, telehealth was identified as an attractive option if it prevents significant travel and can be conducted with a familiar doctor. Participants were strongly driven by cost, particularly greater than $30. Telehealth was least preferred for situations involving a new and unknown physical symptom, and relatively more preferred for surgical follow-up. The latent class analysis demonstrates only 15.9% of participants appeared unwilling to consider telehealth. The findings of this study suggest that meeting the needs of the Australian population requires a blended approach to service delivery, with telehealth being valued in a range of clinical scenarios. Price sensitivity was evident, therefore if telehealth services can be delivered with lower patient cost, then they are likely to be attractive.",2023,,PLoS One,18,3,e0283821,,10.1371/journal.pone.0283821,37000814,#1391,Savira 2023,,,1
Approach to Patients with High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer: Radiation Oncology Perspective.,Kamran SC; Vapiwala N,"High-risk localized prostate cancer is a challenging clinical entity to treat, with heterogeneous responses to an evolving array of multidisciplinary treatment approaches. In addition, this disease state is growing in incidence due to a variety of factors, including shifting recommendations that discouraged routine prostate cancer screening. Current guidelines now incorporate an informed decision-making process for prostate cancer screening and evaluation. More work is underway to improve targeted screening for certain at-risk populations and to implement greater personalization in the use of diagnostic tools. Once diagnosed with high-risk localized disease, a multimodality treatment paradigm is warranted. Radiation-in its various forms and combinations-plays a large and continually evolving role in the management of high-risk prostate cancer, yet treatment outcomes are still suboptimal. There is a growing need to improve upon current treatment approaches, and better personalize a particular treatment recommendation based on both tumor and patient characteristics, as well as patient preference and goals of therapy. Given that treatment generally requires more than one therapy, there are notable implications on long-term quality of life, especially with respect to overlapping and cumulative side effects of local and systemic therapies, respectively. The desire for aggressive therapy to optimize cancer control outcomes must be weighed against the risk of morbidities and overtreatment and discussed with each patient so that an informed decision about treatment and care can be determined. High-level evidence to support treatment recommendations, where available, is critical for a data-driven and tailored approach to address all goals of care.",2024,Jan,Curr Treat Options Oncol,25,1,84-96,,10.1007/s11864-023-01163-3,38167980,#504,Kamran 2024,,,0
TB preventive therapy preferences among children and adolescents.,Strauss M; Wademan DT; Mcinziba A; Hoddinott G; Rafique M; Jola LN; Streicher C; du Preez K; Osman M; Boffa J; Hausler H; Hesseling AC; Hirsch-Moverman Y,"BACKGROUND: TB preventive therapy (TPT) is critical for ending TB, yet implementation remains poor. With new global guidelines expanding TPT eligibility and regimens, we aimed to understand TPT preferences among children, adolescents and caregivers.METHODS: We undertook a discrete choice experiment among 131 children, 170 adolescents and 173 caregivers, and conducted 17 in-depth interviews in 25 clinics in Cape Town, South Africa. The design included attributes for location, waiting time, treatment duration, dosing frequency, formulation/size, side effects, packaging and taste. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used for analysis.RESULTS: Among children and caregivers, the number and size of pills, taste and side effects were important drivers of preferences. Among adolescents and caregivers, clinic waiting times and side effects were significant drivers of preferences. Adolescents expressed concerns about being stigmatised, and preferred services from local clinics to services delivered in the community. Dosing frequency and treatment duration were only significant drivers of choice among adolescents, and only if linked to fewer clinic visits.CONCLUSIONS: Introducing shorter TPT regimens in isolation without consideration of preferences and health services may not have the desired effect on uptake and completion.

Patients' acceptance of a shared cancer follow-up model of care between general practitioners and radiation oncologists: A population-based survey using the theoretical Framework of Acceptability.,Sandell T; Schütze H; Miller A; Ivers R,"INTRODUCTION: International and national guidelines highlight the need for general practitioner involvement during and after active cancer treatment and throughout long-term follow-up care. This paper aimed to evaluate patients' acceptance of radiation oncology shared follow-up care using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA). METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at two cancer care centres in the Illawarra Shoalhaven region of Australia. A sample of patients scheduled for a radiation oncology follow-up consultation in 2021 were sent a 32-point self-complete paper-based survey. Data were analysed using descriptive, parametric and non-parametric statistical analysis. This paper followed the Checklist for Reporting of Survey Studies (CROSS). RESULTS: Of the 414 surveys returned (45% response rate), the acceptance for radiation oncology shared cancer follow-up care was high (80%). Patients treated with only radiotherapy were 1.7 times more likely to accept shared follow-up care than those treated with multiple modalities. Patients who preferred follow-up care for fewer than three years were 7.5 times more likely to accept shared care than those who preferred follow-up care for five years. Patients who travelled more than 20 minutes to their radiation oncologist or to the rural cancer centre were slightly more likely to accept shared care than those who travelled less than twenty minutes to the regional cancer centre. A high understanding of shared care (Intervention Coherence) and a positive feeling towards shared care (Affective Attitude) were significant predictive factors in accepting shared radiation oncology follow-up care. CONCLUSION: Health services need to ensure patient preferences are considered to provide patient-centred cancer follow-up care. Shared cancer follow-up care implementation should start with patients who prefer a shorter follow-up period and understand the benefits of shared care. However, patients' involvement needs to be considered alongside other clinical risk profiles and organisational factors. Future qualitative research using the TFA constructs is warranted to inform clinical practice change.",2023,Mar,BMC Prim Care,24,1,86,,10.1186/s12875-023-02032-6,36973691,#1399,Sandell 2023,,,0
Linear versus Turbulent Airflow Tracheostomy Heat and Moisture Exchangers: A Crossover Study.,Shikani AH; Rohayem Z; D'Adamo CR; Miller AC,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of two tracheostomy heat and moisture exchangers (HMEs), namely the Shikani Oxygen HME™ (S-O(2) HME, ball type, turbulent airflow) and Mallinckrodt Tracheolife II DAR HME (M-O(2) HME; flapper type, linear airflow) on tracheobronchial mucosal health, oxygenation, humidification, and patient preference. METHODS: A randomized cross-over study was conducted with HME-naïve long-term tracheostomy subjects at two academic medical centers. Bronchoscopy assessments of mucosal health were performed at baseline and day 5 of HME application, along with oxygen saturation (S(pO2) ) and breathed air humidity at four oxygen flow rates (1, 2, 3, and 5 lpm). Patient preference was assessed on study conclusion. RESULTS: Both HMEs were associated with improved mucosal inflammation and decreased mucus production (p < 0.0002), with greater improvements in the S-O(2) HME group (p < 0.007). Both HMEs improved humidity concentration at each oxygen flow rate (p < 0.0001), without significant differences between groups. S(pO2) was greater for the S-O(2) HME versus the M-O(2) HME across all measured oxygen flow rates (p = 0.003). At low oxygen flow rates (1 or 2 lpm), the S(pO2) in the S-O(2) HME group was similar to that of the M-O(2) HME at higher oxygen flow rates (3 or 5 lpm; p = 0.6). Ninety percent of subjects preferred the S-O(2) HME. CONCLUSION: Tracheostomy HME uses correlated with improved indicators of tracheobronchial mucosal health, humidity, and oxygenation. The S-O(2) HME outperformed the M-O(2) HME with respect to tracheobronchial inflammation, S(pO2) , and patient preference. Regular HME use by tracheostomy patients is recommended to optimize pulmonary health. Newer ball-type speaking valve technology additionally allows concomitant HME and speaking valve application.

"A discrete choice experiment to elicit preferences for a liver screening programme in Queensland, Australia: a mixed methods study to select attributes and levels.",Allen MJ; Doran R; Brain D; Powell EE; O'Beirne J; Valery PC; Barnett A; Hettiarachchi R; Hickman IJ; Kularatna S,"BACKGROUND: In Australia, the overall prevalence of liver disease is increasing. Maximising uptake of community screening programmes by understanding patient preferences is integral to developing consumer-centred care models for liver disease. Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are widely used to elicit preferences for various healthcare services. Attribute development is a vital component of a well-designed DCE and should be described in sufficient detail for others to assess the validity of outcomes. Hence, this study aimed to create a list of potential attributes and levels which can be used in a DCE study to elicit preferences for chronic liver disease screening programmes. METHODS: Key attributes were developed through a multi-stage, mixed methods design. Focus groups were held with consumers and health care providers on attributes of community screening programmes for liver disease. Stakeholders then prioritised attributes generated from the focus group in order of importance via an online prioritisation survey. The outcomes of the prioritisation exercise were then reviewed and refined by an expert panel to ensure clinically meaningful levels and relevance for a DCE survey. RESULTS: Fifteen attributes were generated during the focus group sessions deemed necessary to design liver disease screening services. Outcomes of the prioritisation exercise and expert panel stages recognised five attributes, with three levels each, for inclusion in a DCE survey to elicit consumer preferences for community screening for liver disease. This study also highlights broader social issues such as the stigma around liver disease that require careful consideration by policy makers when designing or implementing a liver screening programme. CONCLUSIONS: The attributes and levels identified will inform future DCE surveys to understand consumer preferences for community screening programmes for liver disease. In addition, the outcomes will help inform the implementation of the LOCATE-NAFLD programme in real-world practice, and could be relevant for other liver and non-liver related chronic disease screening programmes.",2023,Sep,BMC Health Serv Res,23,1,950,,10.1186/s12913-023-09934-2,37670274,#891,Allen 2023,,,1

Preferences Regarding Breast Surgery Omission Among Patients With Breast Cancer Who Receive Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.,Nakamura K; Ishitobi M; Oshiro C; Shima H; Takahashi E; Nakayama T; Shien T; Saito K; Iwatani T; Seto Y; Terata K; Kutomi G; Ogawa T; Inaji H,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Currently, several ongoing prospective studies are investigating the safety of breast surgery omission in patients with breast cancer who are exceptional responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, there is little information about the preferences of these patients regarding omission of breast surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a questionnaire survey to assess preferences regarding omission of breast surgery among patients with breast cancer who had human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive or estrogen receptor-negative tumors and good clinical response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients' estimation of the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after definitive surgery or breast surgery omission was also assessed. RESULTS: Of 93 patients, only 22 (23.7%) said they would omit breast surgery. Under the scenario of omitting breast surgery, the 5-year IBTR rate estimated by patients who said they would omit breast surgery was significantly lower (median, 10%) than the rate estimated by patients who preferred undergoing definitive surgery (median, 30%) (p=0.017). CONCLUSION: The proportion of our surveyed patients who were willing to omit breast surgery was low.

"""It's Important to Work with People that Look Like Me"": Black Patients' Preferences for Patient-Provider Race Concordance.",Moore C; Coates E; Watson A; de Heer R; McLeod A; Prudhomme A,"A compelling body of research supports the race concordance hypothesis, which asserts that racially minoritized patients who share the same race and ethnicity with their provider have improved communication, better perceptions of care, and better health outcomes. Using a mixed methods approach, this study examined (1) the association between racial identity and patients' preference for race-concordant patient-provider dyads and (2) Black patients' subjective experiences of race concordance. Data were gathered from 47 Black caregivers who completed both a survey and participated in a focus group. Quantitative analyses revealed that the majority (83%) of caregivers reported that it is important to have a mental health provider of the same race and ethnicity. Greater racial centrality, but not private or public regard, was associated with a stronger race concordance preference. Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed six themes related to race-concordant preferences: aspects related to the patient care experience, cultural humility, relatability, diversity in cultural experiences, role models for children, and intersecting identities. Patients with a race concordance preference felt more comfortable with their provider, perceived that it was easier to build a rapport with their provider, and emphasized the value of representation for themselves and their children. Patients who were neutral in their race concordance preference emphasized professionalism over race, valued diverse perspectives, and appreciated their providers' cultural awareness and willingness to self-educate. The integration of these findings will help to elucidate a more nuanced understanding of the factors that build the therapeutic relationship and cultivate a framework of comfort and understanding in the clinical setting.",2023,Oct,J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,10,5,2552-2564,,10.1007/s40615-022-01435-y,36344747,#848,Moore 2023,,,0
Treatment Patterns of Cancer-associated Thrombosis in the Netherlands: The Four Cities Study.,Kaptein FHJ; Guman NAM; Lohle SB; Klok FA; Mairuhu ATA; Kamphuisen PW; Es NV; Huisman MV,"Background  Current guidelines recommend either low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as first-line treatment in cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE). Aim  This study aimed to investigate treatment regimens for cancer-associated VTE over the past 5 years, explore predictors for initial treatment (LMWH vs. DOAC), and to assess the risks of recurrent VTE and bleeding. Methods  This was a Dutch, multicenter, retrospective cohort study including consecutive patients with cancer-associated VTE between 2017 and 2021. Treatment predictors were assessed with multivariable logistic regression models. Six-month cumulative incidences for recurrent VTE and major bleeding (MB) were estimated with death as competing risk. Results  In total, 1,215 patients were included. The majority (1,134/1,192; 95%) started VTE treatment with anticoagulation: 561 LMWH (47%), 510 DOACs (43%), 27 vitamin K antagonist (2.3%), and 36 other/unknown type (3.0%). The proportion of patients primarily treated with DOACs increased from 18% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12-25) in 2017 to 70% (95% CI 62-78) in 2021. Poor performance status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.99) and distant metastases (aOR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.82) were associated with primary treatment with LMWH. Total 6-month cumulative incidences were 6.0% (95% CI 4.8-7.5) for recurrent VTE and 7.0% (95% CI 5.7-8.6) for MB. During follow-up, 182 patients (15%) switched from LMWH to a DOAC, and 54 patients (4.4%) vice versa, for various reasons, including patient preference, recurrent thrombosis, and/or bleeding. Conclusion  DOAC use in cancer-associated VTE has increased rapidly over the past years. Changes in anticoagulation regimen were frequent over time, and were often related to recurrent thrombotic and bleeding complications, illustrating the complexity and challenges of managing cancer-associated VTE.",2024,Jan,TH Open,8,1,e61-e71,,10.1055/a-2214-8101,38298199,#446,KapteinFHJ 2024,,,0
Women's perceptions of body mass graphics and their preferences for weight counselling.,Kaak KB; Holliday CP; Mulekar MS; Trepman E; Holliday NP,"Health care providers may lack data-driven guidance about best practises for discussing weight. We assessed women's self-perception of body mass index (BMI) and preferences for weight counselling by provider characteristics and the initiating question. A voluntary, anonymous survey was completed by 756 women (age ≥ 19 year) at our tertiary care obstetrics and gynaecology clinics in autumn 2021. The respondents' height and weight were collected before respondents selected graphics from a validated Body Image Scale that they felt best represented their current body size and which graphs should prompt weight loss or gain recommendations. Respondents were asked their preferences about provider characteristics for discussion about weight and to identify which of six initiating questions from a provider was most and least preferred. Blank responses were allowed. In 708 responses, 366 women (52%) selected the most accurate graphic that corresponded to their BMI; the selected graphic represented a lower than actual BMI in 268 women (38%) and higher in 74 women (10%). In 648 responses, 374 women (58%) preferred a female provider, but provider body shape, ethnicity/race and age were not important to most women. The most preferred question to initiate a discussion about weight was ""A lot of women have trouble achieving or maintaining a healthy weight; is that something we can discuss?"" in 181 of 555 women (33%), and the least preferred question was ""Do you feel like you are at an appropriate weight?"" in 172 of 554 women (31%).

Differences between physician and patient preferences for cancer treatments: a systematic review.,Zhang M; He X; Wu J; Xie F,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making is useful to facilitate cancer treatment decisions. However, it is difficult to make treatment decisions when physician and patient preferences are different. This review aimed to summarize and compare the preferences for cancer treatments between physicians and patients. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Scopus. Studies elicited and compared preferences for cancer treatments between physicians and patients were included. Information about the study design and preference measuring attributes or questions were extracted. The available relative rank of every attribute in discrete choice experiment (DCE) studies and answers to preference measuring questions in non-DCE studies were summarized followed by a narrative synthesis to reflect the preference differences. RESULTS: Of 12,959 studies identified, 8290 were included in the title and abstract screening and 48 were included in the full text screening. Included 37 studies measured the preferences from six treatment-related aspects: health benefit, adverse effects, treatment process, cost, impact on quality of life, and provider qualification. The trade-off between health benefit and adverse effects was the main focus of the included studies. DCE studies showed patients gave a higher rank on health benefit and treatment process, while physicians gave a higher rank on adverse effects. Non-DCE studies suggested that patients were willing to take a higher risk of adverse effects or lower health benefit than physicians when accepting a treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians and patients had important preference differences for cancer treatment. More sufficient communication is needed in cancer treatment decision-making.",2023,Nov,BMC Cancer,23,1,1126,,10.1186/s12885-023-11598-4,37980466,#675,Zhang 2023,,,1
Patient-Centered Clinical Trial Design for Heart Failure Devices via Bayesian Decision Analysis.,Chaudhuri SE; Adamson P; Bruhn-Ding D; Ben Chaouch Z; Gebben D; Rincon-Gonzalez L; Liden B; Reed SD; Saha A; Schaber D; Stein K; Tarver ME; Lo AW,"BACKGROUND: The statistical significance of clinical trial outcomes is generally interpreted quantitatively according to the same threshold of 2.5% (in one-sided tests) to control the false-positive rate or type I error, regardless of the burden of disease or patient preferences. The clinical significance of trial outcomes-including patient preferences-are also considered, but through qualitative means that may be challenging to reconcile with the statistical evidence. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to apply Bayesian decision analysis to heart failure device studies to choose an optimal significance threshold that maximizes the expected utility to patients across both the null and alternative hypotheses, thereby allowing clinical significance to be incorporated into statistical decisions either in the trial design stage or in the post-trial interpretation stage. In this context, utility is a measure of how much well-being the approval decision for the treatment provides to the patient. METHODS: We use the results from a discrete-choice experiment study focusing on heart failure patients' preferences, questioning respondents about their willingness to accept therapeutic risks in exchange for quantifiable benefits with alternative hypothetical medical device performance characteristics. These benefit-risk trade-off data allow us to estimate the loss in utility-from the patient perspective-of a false-positive or false-negative pivotal trial result. We compute the Bayesian decision analysis-optimal statistical significance threshold that maximizes the expected utility to heart failure patients for a hypothetical two-arm, fixed-sample, randomized controlled trial. An interactive Excel-based tool is provided that illustrates how the optimal statistical significance threshold changes as a function of patients' preferences for varying rates of false positives and false negatives, and as a function of assumed key parameters. RESULTS: In our baseline analysis, the Bayesian decision analysis-optimal significance threshold for a hypothetical two-arm randomized controlled trial with a fixed sample size of 600 patients per arm was 3.2%, with a statistical power of 83.2%. This result reflects the willingness of heart failure patients to bear additional risks of the investigational device in exchange for its probable benefits. However, for increased device-associated risks and for risk-averse subclasses of heart failure patients, Bayesian decision analysis-optimal significance thresholds may be smaller than 2.5%. CONCLUSIONS: A Bayesian decision analysis is a systematic, transparent, and repeatable process for combining clinical and statistical significance, explicitly incorporating burden of disease and patient preferences into the regulatory decision-making process.",2023,Jul,Patient,16,4,359-369,,10.1007/s40271-023-00623-0,37076697,#1121,Chaudhuri 2023,,,1
A 23-year-old patient with bilateral hypoplastic thumbs and toes: A case report.,Hamsho S; Sleiay M; Alaswad M; Alsmodi H; Al-Hakeem K,"KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: However, it is noteworthy that certain patients with minor functional limitations in their hand may have experienced undiagnosed thumb hypoplasia during their childhood years. These individuals may have successfully adapted to their condition without seeking medical intervention and may express a preference for nonintervention (as in this case). ABSTRACT: Thumb hypoplasia is a congenital underdevelopment of the thumb, accounting for 5%-15% of congenital hand disorders. It occurs equally among both genders and can affect both thumbs. The condition is categorized using Blauth's classification with Type I being the mildest form. We report a 23-year-old Syrian male presented with a bilateral restriction in opposition movement when using a pen or razor. Clinical examination and x-ray imaging revealed a bilateral Type I hypoplastic thumb with bilateral minimal hypoplasia of the toes. Despite the surgical treatment options available, the patient opted not to undergo surgery due to his adaptation to his condition. Hypoplastic thumb Type I is a congenital condition characterized by underdevelopment of the thumb. Bilateral thumb hypoplasia with toes hypoplasia is extremely rare. A full systemic evaluation should be done due to its associations with other syndromic manifestations and treatment options are discussed concerning the best functional outcomes and patient preferences.",2024,Mar,Clin Case Rep,12,3,e8567,,10.1002/ccr3.8567,38444917,#263,Hamsho 2024,,,0
Family Spillover Effects: Are Economic Evaluations Misrepresenting the Value of Healthcare Interventions to Society?,Leech AA; Lin PJ; D'Cruz B; Parsons SK; Lavelle TA,"The societal impacts of health interventions are seldom incorporated into health economic evaluations, including the impact that illness can have on informal or unpaid caregivers and other family members (i.e., ""family spillover effects""). Previous research has demonstrated that by excluding family spillover effects, the value of health interventions may be underestimated on average. In this commentary, we discuss how the inclusion of spillover effects influences how we value interventions and, given the extent to which caregiver/family effects are largely not captured or known, propose ways in which these data could be more systematically collected or estimated and used by researchers. These recommendations include prioritizing data collection alongside clinical trials and patient registries, engaging expert opinion panels, and developing mapping algorithms for estimating caregiver/family utility values from non-preference-based caregiver health-related quality-of-life measures and/or from patient preference-based measures.",2023,Jan,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,21,1,5-10,,10.1007/s40258-022-00755-8,35997896,#1666,Leech 2023,,,0

ANALYSIS THE RESULTS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT AND EARLY REHABILITATION OF PATIENTS WITH MASSIVE TEARS THE ROTATOR CUFF THE SHOULDER.,Sergienko R; Vovchenko A; Kravchuk L; Zinchenko V; Ivanovska O,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the treatment outcomes in patients who underwent arthroscopic repair of large and massive rotator cuff tears and underwent rehabilitation at different stages of the recovery process. The clinical study group consisted of 88 patients, with an age range of 47 to 68 years (mean age 52,7±9,5 years). All patients underwent a double-row repair of the rotator cuff tendons and tenodesis or tenotomy of the long head of the biceps tendon under arthroscopic guidance. The results were assessed using the Constant Shoulder Score and the Oxford Shoulder Score scales at 6 and 12 months after the surgery. A total of 88 patients were selected, with 50 patients in the main group (MG) who had a 6-week immobilization period. The control group (CG) consisted of 38 patients who had a shortened immobilization period of 3-4 weeks due to patient preference or recommendations from other rehabilitation centers where patients underwent rehabilitation. Shoulder immobilization was performed using a standard sling with a triangular pillow and a 15° abduction angle in the shoulder joint. Following the surgeon's recommendation, all patients were offered a rehabilitation program consisting of three periods: immobilization (0-6 weeks), functional (6-12 weeks), and training (>12 weeks) periods. Comparative analysis of the treatment results using the Oxford Shoulder Score scale showed that significantly better results were obtained in the MG patients (41,5±2,1 points) compared to the CG patients (34,2±3,6 points) at 6,2±1,2 months (p˂0.05). Comparative analysis of the treatment results using the Oxford Shoulder Score scale at 12,2±1,3 months showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the MG and CG results (MG - 44,5±2,2 and CG - 42,4±3, p>0,05). Similarly, according to the Constant Shoulder Score scale, better results were observed in the MG both at 6 months and 12 months after the surgery (excellent in 82% of MG vs 36.8% in CG, good in 18% of MG vs 57.9% in CG, respectively). Thus, in the short term, early activation of the operated joint leads to delayed healing of the operated tissues and worsening of joint function, as confirmed by the comparative analysis of the examined groups. Significant advantages of prolonged immobilization (at least 6 weeks) were found in short-term observation (up to 6 months), and no differences in functional outcomes were observed in the long term during the follow-up at 12 months.",2023,Jun,Georgian Med News,,339,123-128,,,37522787,#1174,Sergienko 2023,,,0

The current guidelines besides the individual approach greatly emphasize on the importance of population level approaches to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Systematic global CVD risk assessment is recommended in individuals with any major vascular risk factor. Regarding LDL-Cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus, goals and targets remain as recommended in previous guidelines. However, it is proposed a new, stepwise approach (Step 1 and 2) to treatment intensification as a tool to help physicians and patients pursue these targets in a way that fits patient profile. After Step 1, considering proceeding to the intensified goals of Step 2 is mandatory, and this intensification will be based on 10-year CVD risk, lifetime CVD risk and treatment benefit, comorbidities and patient preferences. The updated SCORE algorithm-SCORE2, SCORE-OP- is recommended in these guidelines, which estimates an individual's 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke) in healthy men and women aged 40-89 years. Another new and important recommendation is the use of different categories of risk according different age groups (< 50, 50-69, ≥70 years). Different flow charts of CVD risk and risk factor treatment in apparently healthy persons, in patients with established atherosclerotic CVD, and in diabetic patients are recommended. Patients with chronic kidney disease are considered high risk or very high-risk patients according to the levels of glomerular filtration rate and albumin-to-creatinine ratio. New lifestyle recommendations adapted to the ones published by the Spanish Ministry of Health as well as recommendations focused on the management of lipids, blood pressure, diabetes and chronic renal failure are included.",2023,May-Jun,Nefrologia (Engl Ed),43,3,360-369,,10.1016/j.nefroe.2023.08.001,37635013,#1253,Brotons 2023,,,0
Addressing Patient Requests to Add Dietary Supplements to Their Cancer Care-A Suggested Approach.,Frenkel M; Morse MB; Narayanan S,"Dietary supplements are widely utilized by cancer patients as part of a complementary and integrative approach to their healthcare. However, a significant portion of patients refrain from discussing their supplement use with their physicians, often due to the perceived indifference or negativity of their healthcare providers. This communication gap exposes patients to unreliable information sources and potential risks associated with uninformed supplementation. As the healthcare landscape evolves, there is an increasing recognition of the pivotal role that physicians play in guiding patients' healthcare decisions. A patient-centered perspective prioritizes the provision of evidence-based information tailored to the individual's needs. It advocates for open discussions about potential risks and fosters shared decision making, respecting patient autonomy. Additionally, this approach involves offering alternative options, documenting patient preferences, and ensuring ongoing support while coordinating with the healthcare team. To address these evolving needs, healthcare providers must adopt a transformative perspective, becoming expert guides who engage with their patients as informed and empowered participants. This revised approach emphasizes an open dialogue that balances presenting facts and acknowledging uncertainties surrounding dietary supplement use. Our narrative review of the literature underscores the importance of a practical approach, centered on transparent discussions and respect for patient autonomy. By following this approach, healthcare providers can empower patients to navigate the complexities of dietary supplement use within the context of cancer care, thereby safeguarding patient safety and overall well-being. Notably, our proposed tool highlights the utilization of reliable sources, the risk stratification of supplements, specific recommendations, and subsequent monitoring, providing a structured framework for informed decision making.",2023,Dec,Nutrients,15,24,,,10.3390/nu15245029,38140288,#576,Frenkel 2023,,,0

Quantitative Benefit-Risk Assessment in Medical Product Decision Making: A Good Practices Report of an ISPOR Task Force.,Tervonen T; Veldwijk J; Payne K; Ng X; Levitan B; Lackey LG; Marsh K; Thokala P; Pignatti F; Donnelly A; Ho M,"Benefit-risk assessment is commonly conducted by drug and medical device developers and regulators, to evaluate and communicate issues around benefit-risk balance of medical products. Quantitative benefit-risk assessment (qBRA) is a set of techniques that incorporate explicit outcome weighting within a formal analysis to evaluate the benefit-risk balance. This report describes emerging good practices for the 5 main steps of developing qBRAs based on the multicriteria decision analysis process. First, research question formulation needs to identify the needs of decision makers and requirements for preference data and specify the role of external experts. Second, the formal analysis model should be developed by selecting benefit and safety endpoints while eliminating double counting and considering attribute value dependence. Third, preference elicitation method needs to be chosen, attributes framed appropriately within the elicitation instrument, and quality of the data should be evaluated. Fourth, analysis may need to normalize the preference weights, base-case and sensitivity analyses should be conducted, and the effect of preference heterogeneity analyzed. Finally, results should be communicated efficiently to decision makers and other stakeholders. In addition to detailed recommendations, we provide a checklist for reporting qBRAs developed through a Delphi process conducted with 34 experts.",2023,Apr,Value Health,26,4,449-460,,10.1016/j.jval.2022.12.006,37005055,#1345,Tervonen 2023,,,1
Evaluating Patient and Provider Preferences for a Once-Weekly Basal Insulin in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes.,Kerr D; Rajpura JR; Namvar T,"PURPOSE: The global burden of disease of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is significant, and insulin currently plays a central role in T2D management. This study sought to assess the preferences of patients with T2D and healthcare providers (HCPs) involved in T2D care regarding a hypothetical once-weekly basal insulin in comparison to current basal insulin options. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a survey-based study in the United States that included a discrete choice experiment (DCE), patients with T2D (insulin naïve and current insulin users) and providers who treat individuals with T2D were asked to evaluate current basal insulins and identify attributes of importance regarding a hypothetical once-weekly basal insulin. A regression analysis was conducted to identify drivers of preference by relevant demographics, attitudes, and behaviors. RESULTS: Most respondents (91% of patients with T2D and 89% of HCPs in the base case scenario) would choose a once-weekly basal insulin product over another type of basal insulin. Both patients with T2D and HCPs rated insulin type and delivery method to be attributes of highest importance in the discrete choice exercise. Current basal insulin users (""insulin experienced"") reported higher levels of confidence that a once-weekly insulin would help them to achieve their desired blood sugar levels compared to their current basal insulin (5.7 vs 5.2 on a 7-point Likert scale). Most insulin-experienced respondents (88%) were likely to inquire about once-weekly basal insulin, and most HCPs (85%) indicated willingness to educate patients on management of their T2D using a once-weekly basal insulin. CONCLUSION: Discussing preferences for T2D medication management is important for patients and HCPs to ensure treatments are offered for patients based on their preferences. This study showed that patient and provider preferences are similar towards a once-weekly basal insulin over current basal insulin preparations.",2024,,Patient Prefer Adherence,18,,411-424,,10.2147/PPA.S436540,38375061,#369,Kerr 2024,,,1
Medication Abortion Follow-Up Rates in a Rural Population Before and After Introduction of a Remote Follow-Up Option.,Chong KC; Xiong LY; Petersen TR; Darley CJ; Hofler LG,"Background: Medication abortion (MAB) follow-up historically involves visiting a health care facility for ultrasonography or laboratory testing. In rural states such as New Mexico, many patients travel hours for MAB, making two visits burdensome. Studies demonstrate feasibility, safety, and patient preference for remote follow-up. Materials and Methods: We evaluated whether MAB follow-up by telephone had noninferior loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) rates compared with ultrasonography or laboratory follow-up in a rural population. This was a retrospective chart review of University of New Mexico MAB LTFU rates after changing to telephone follow-up (home group, n = 136). Patients were propensity-matched in a 1:2 ratio to a historical cohort (health care group, n = 272) to eliminate significant differences. We defined LTFU as no contact within 50 days. We evaluated complications requiring intervention, possible ongoing pregnancy, completion of the home follow-up protocol (7- and 30-day calls, high-sensitivity urine pregnancy test [UPT]), follow-up by intended method (home or health care), and number of call attempts. Results: LTFU rates for the home group (n = 23, 17%) were noninferior to the health care group (n = 60, 22%, p = 0.24). Rates of complications requiring intervention (p = 0.83) and possible ongoing pregnancy (p = 0.72) among the home group were similar to the health care group. Ninety-seven (71%) home group patients completed the initial call, 79 (58%) completed the UPT, and 86 (69%) completed the 30-day call. Ninety-five (70%) home group patients followed up by intended method, comparable with the health care group (n = 199, 73%, p = 0.56). Staff made a median of 3 (interquartile range: 2-4) calls per home group patient. Conclusions: Remote MAB LTFU rates were noninferior to in-person LTFU rates.",2023,Dec,J Womens Health (Larchmt),32,12,1346-1350,,10.1089/jwh.2023.0531,37870746,#611,Chong 2023,,,0
Patients' preferences in dental care: A discrete-choice experiment and an analysis of willingness-to-pay.,Felgner S; Henschke C,"INTRODUCTION: Dental diseases are a major problem worldwide. Costs are a burden on healthcare systems and patients. Missed treatments can have health and financial consequences. Compared to other health services, dental treatments are only covered in parts by statutory health insurance (SHI). Using the example of dental crowns for a cost-intensive treatment, our study aims to investigate whether (1) certain treatment attributes determine patients' treatment choice, and (2) out-of-pocket payments represent a barrier to access dental care. METHODS: We conducted a discrete-choice-experiment by mailing questionnaires to 10,752 people in Germany. In presented scenarios the participants could choose between treatment options (A, B, or none) composed of treatment attribute levels (e.g., color of teeth) for posterior (PT) and anterior teeth (AT). Considering interaction effects, we used a D-efficient fractional factorial design. Choice analysis was performed using different models. Furthermore, we analyzed willingness-to-pay (WTP), preference of choosing no and SHI standard care treatment, and influence of socioeconomic characteristics on individual WTP. RESULTS: Out of n = 762 returned questionnaires (response rate of r = 7.1), n = 380 were included in the analysis. Most of the participants are in age group ""50 to 59 years"" (n = 103, 27.1%) and female (n = 249, 65.5%). The participants' benefit allocations varied across treatment attributes. Aesthetics and durability of dental crowns play most important roles in decision-making. WTP regarding natural color teeth is higher than standard SHI out-of-pocket payment. Estimations for AT dominate. For both tooth areas, ""no treatment"" was a frequent choice (PT: 25.7%, AT: 37.2%). Especially for AT, treatment beyond SHI standard care was often chosen (49.8%, PT: 31.3%). Age, gender, and incentive measures (bonus booklet) influenced WTP per participant. CONCLUSION: This study provides important insights into patient preferences for dental crown treatment in Germany. For our participants, aesthetic for AT and PT as well as out-of-pocket payments for PT play an important role in decision-making. Overall, they are willing to pay more than the current out-of-pockt payments for what they consider to be better crown treatments. Findings may be valuable for policy makers in developing measures that better match patient preferences.",2023,,PLoS One,18,2,e0280441,,10.1371/journal.pone.0280441,36848356,#1502,Felgner 2023,,,1
Comparative effectiveness of ice packs versus topical lidocaine-prilocaine mixture for pain control in laser hair removal of the axilla: A rater-blinded randomized controlled trial.,Roongpisuthipong W; Christensen RE; Dirr MA; Anvery N; Geisler A; Schaeffer M; Waldman A; Brieva JC; Alam M,"BACKGROUND: Laser hair removal is associated with moderate acute pain. OBJECTIVE: To compare effectiveness of ice pack to topical lidocaine-prilocaine for pain reduction during axillary laser hair removal. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive topical anesthetic to one axilla and ice packs to the other before each of 3, monthly 810 nm diode laser sessions. The primary endpoint was participant-reported pain on the visual analog scale (VAS) immediately following and 5 minutes after laser session. Posttreatment erythema, overall edema, and perifollicular edema were assessed by 2 blinded photoraters. Skin temperatures, patient preferences, and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: Eighty-eight of 90 (98%) planned laser treatments were delivered and randomized. Participants reported higher VAS scores immediately after laser treatment with lidocaine-prilocaine compared to ice (P = .03). Five minutes after, participants reported higher VAS scores with ice (P = .03). After 53 of the 88 treatments (60.2%), participants reported preferring ice (P = .055). No serious adverse events were reported. LIMITATIONS: All participants were Caucasian or Asian with Fitzpatrick skin type I to III and coarse dark axillary hair, which may limit generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: While pain control with ice and topical anesthesia is associated with time after treatment, the 2 modalities do not differ in terms of degree of pain reduction associated with axillary laser hair removal.",2023,Mar,J Am Acad Dermatol,88,3,617-622,,10.1016/j.jaad.2022.11.022,36410628,#1477,Roongpisuthipong 2023,,,0
Phase III Randomized Non-Inferiority Study of OSS Versus PEG + Electrolyte Colonoscopy Preparation in Adolescents.,Socha P; Posovszky C; Szychta M; Viscogliosi F; Martemucci L; Grzybowska-Chlebowczyk U; Perrot V; Kornowski A; Benninga MA,"OBJECTIVES: Many protocols and preparations are used for bowel cleansing before pediatric colonoscopy but few are based on scientific evidence. We evaluated efficacy, safety, tolerability, and patient preference of oral sulfate solution (OSS) at 75% of the adult dose versus polyethylene glycol (PEG)-electrolyte solution in adolescents presenting for diagnostic colonoscopy. METHODS: Phase III, randomized, evaluator-blinded, non-inferiority study of OSS and PEG in adolescents aged 12-17 years. OSS and PEG were administered in 2 doses on the day before colonoscopy. Primary endpoint included proportion of patients with successful overall preparation (4-point scale). Secondary endpoints included overall and segmental bowel cleansing (Boston Bowel Preparation Scale; BBPS), completed colonoscopies, duration of examination, time to cecal intubation, proportion of nasogastric tubes (NGTs), adverse events (AEs) and acceptability. RESULTS: Successful cleansing was achieved in 71.4% and 79.0% of patients receiving OSS and PEG, respectively [adjusted difference -7.61 (95% confidence interval, CI, -18.45 to 3.24); P = 0.0907]. Segmental BBPS score for the left and transverse colon were similar between treatment groups, but better for the right colon with PEG than OSS [2.2 (95% CI, 2.0-2.4) and 1.9 (95% CI, 1.7-2.1), respectively; P = 0.0015]. Significantly fewer OSS patients needed NGT placement to ingest the whole solution [9/125 (7.2%)] than PEG patients [36/116 (31.0%); P < 0.0001]. Treatment acceptability was significantly higher with OSS than PEG ( P < 0.0001). Duration of examination, completed colonoscopies, and time to cecal intubation were similar between preparations. Gastrointestinal AEs including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and distension were similar in both groups but more patients receiving PEG had AEs assessed as incapacitating. CONCLUSIONS: Non-inferiority of OSS to PEG was not demonstrated, but OSS was associated with a lower requirement for NGT, better acceptability, and less frequent severe AEs than with PEG.",2023,May,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,76,5,652-659,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT03008460,10.1097/MPG.0000000000003745,36821851,#1283,Socha 2023,,,0
Willingness to provide informal care to older adults in Germany: a discrete choice experiment.,de Jong L; Schmidt T; Stahmeyer JT; Eberhard S; Zeidler J; Damm K,"As the German population is continually aging and the majority of older adults still wish to 'age in place', the need for informal care provided by family and friends will correspondingly continue to increase. In addition, while the need for formal (professional) care services is also likely to increase, the supply already does not meet the demand in Germany today. The aim of our study is the elicitation of people's willingness to provide informal care by means of a discrete choice experiment. The self-complete postal survey was disseminated to a random sample of the German general population in Lower Saxony. Data cleansing resulted in a final sample size of 280 participants. A conditional logit and a latent class model were estimated. All attributes were judged as highly relevant by the respondents. The results revealed that an increase in the care hours per day had the greatest negative impact overall on the willingness to provide informal care in our sample. The marginal willingness-to-accept for 1 h of informal care was €14.54 when having to provide informal care for 8 h in reference to 2 h per day. This value is considerably higher than the national minimum wage of €9.82. A three-class latent class model revealed preference heterogeneity. While a monetary compensation is often discussed to increase the willingness and availability of informal care in a country, our results show that this statement could not be generalized within our entire sample.",2023,Apr,Eur J Health Econ,24,3,425-436,,10.1007/s10198-022-01483-5,35689744,#1385,deJong 2023,,,1
A rapid umbrella review of the literature surrounding the provision of patient-centred end-of-life care.,Hatzikiriakidis K; Ayton D; Skouteris H; Patitsas L; Smith K; Dhulia A; Poon P,"BACKGROUND: Patients have reported a broad range of unmet needs in their receipt of clinical care at the end of life. Therefore, enhancing the quality of end-of-life care through patient-centred healthcare interactions is warranted. AIM: The aim of this rapid umbrella review was to synthesise previous literature reviews that have examined: (1) patient preferences for patient-centred end-of-life care; (2) barriers and enablers to patient-centred end-of-life care; (3) interventions designed to enhance patient-centred end-of-life care; and (4) patient-centred models of end-of-life care. DESIGN: A rapid umbrella review was conducted and informed by the Joanna Briggs Institute's methodological guidance for conducting umbrella reviews. DATA SOURCES: Three academic databases were searched for relevant literature in May 2022: MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL Plus. Inclusion criteria encompassed literature reviews that examined the topic of patient-centred care for any adult patients in end-of-life care. RESULTS: A total of 92 literature reviews were identified. Findings suggest that there is often a discrepancy between patient preferences and the provision of care. These discrepancies have been associated with a range of barriers at the patient, staff and system levels. Common interventions included education and training for staff which were often met with improved patient outcomes. Patient-centred models of care were underrepresented across the literature. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlighted a need for healthcare systems to support staff in providing a patient-centred end of life experience through the development of a co-designed patient-centred model of care, supplemented by professional development and a systematic approach to identifying and documenting patient preferences.",2023,Sep,Palliat Med,37,8,1079-1099,,10.1177/02692163231183007,37448148,#918,Hatzikiriakidis 2023,,,0
Impact of Potential Symptoms and Risks Associated with Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency on Patients and Caregivers: A Best-Worst Scaling Study.,Mansfield C; Nalysnyk L; Joshi D; Coulter J; Pulikottil-Jacob R,"PURPOSE: Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is a rare, progressive, and potentially fatal disease affecting major organs; its symptoms present heterogeneously. Data on the most bothersome symptoms for patients with ASMD types B or A/B and their caregivers or parents are limited. We conducted a survey to quantify the relative impact of potential ASMD symptoms and risks for patients and parents/caregivers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty respondents, recruited via National Niemann-Pick Disease Foundation (United States) and Niemann-Pick United Kingdom, took a preference survey: 11 patients who had a self-reported diagnosis of ASMD types B or A/B and 9 parents who had a child with ASMD types B or A/B. Using object-case best-worst scaling, we explored the most and least bothersome among a set of 15 ASMD symptoms/risks selected based on clinical input and qualitative research with patients and caregivers. In 15 experimentally designed questions containing five items each, respondents ranked the symptoms/risks, irrespective of their experiences with them. Data were analyzed using a conditional multinomial logit model. RESULTS: Patients reported constant abdominal pain, severe pain in bones and joints, and severe fatigue to be the most bothersome potential symptoms or risks, followed by a chance of bleeding in the spleen. The next most bothersome potential symptom was constant shortness of breath. Easy bruising and noticeable abdominal enlargement were among the least bothersome symptoms. The most bothersome symptom for parents was bleeding in the spleen. CONCLUSION: Patients and parents had similar perceptions of the most bothersome potential symptoms/risks. Despite the small sample size typical of rare disease studies, understanding patient preferences is important for such diseases and can inform shared decision-making.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,927-939,,10.2147/PPA.S381371,37020662,#1393,Mansfield 2023,,,1
Contributing and limiting factors to guideline-adherent therapy in senior and elderly breast cancer patients: a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study using clinical and cancer registry data in Germany.,Heidenreich A; Fuchshofen R; Elsner S; Gieseler F; Katalinic A; Hübner J,"PURPOSE: Elderly cancer patients are less likely to be treated in accordance with evidence-based guideline recommendations. This study examines patient-related factors associated with deviations from guideline recommendations. METHODS: Using medical documentation and cancer registry data, we investigated the treatment courses of female breast cancer patients aged 50 and older in Germany regarding compliance with German guidelines. Participants completed a questionnaire querying factors hypothesized to be associated with guideline adherence. We conducted univariate analyses to explore the data and select variables for multivariate logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: Of 1150 participants, 206 (17.9%) were treated in deviation from guideline recommendations. Patients 70 years and older were more likely to be treated deviating from guideline recommendations than patients 50-69 years old (OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.52-2.80). Patients aged 50-69 years who reported that quality of life guided their treatment decision were more likely to be treated in deviation from guideline recommendations (AOR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.11-3.92) than the elderly. In older patients, higher age was associated with an increased chance of receiving guideline-discordant care (AOR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01-1.11), as was depression diagnosed prior to cancer (AOR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.00-3.40). CONCLUSION: Reasons for deviations from guideline recommendations in breast cancer patients differ by age. In decision-making concerning elderly patients, particular attention should be paid to those with pre-existing depressive disorders. Adequately addressing their needs and concerns could prevent inappropriate deviations from guideline recommendations.",2023,Dec,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,149,19,17297-17306,,10.1007/s00432-023-05446-y,37815663,#615,Heidenreich 2023,,,0
"A Head-to-Head Comparison of Computed Tomography Colonography, Optical Colonoscopy, and Colon Endoscopic Capsule for the Detection of Polyps After Partial Colectomy or Rectosigmoidectomy for Colorectal Cancer: A Pilot Study.",Sakai CM; Ueda SKN; Caiado AHM; Ribeiro IB; Marinho FRT; de Rezende DT; Bustamante-Lopez LA; Nahas SC; de Moura DTH; de Moura EGH,"Background and objective Optical colonoscopy is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) and it allows for biopsy and resection, as well as documentation of synchronous lesions. CT colonography (CTC) and colon endoscopic capsule (CEC) are also recommended as alternative minimally invasive or non-invasive procedures. Prospective studies comparing these three approaches are scarce in the current literature. In light of this, the aim of this pilot study was to compare the efficacy of polyp detection between these three methods in patients with a history of curative surgical resection of CRC. Methods Patients were consecutively recruited and all procedures were sequentially conducted on the same day. The primary endpoint was the detection rate of polyps, whereas secondary endpoints were the detection of polyps according to size and location, and the adverse events caused by these procedures. Results A total of 21 patients were consecutively included and all of them underwent all three interventions. No adverse events, local recurrences, or metachronous lesions were detected. In two cases with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CTC unveiled distant metastasis. Optical colonoscopy registered a mean of 0.4 polyp >6 mm and 1.3 polyps <6 mm per patient. CTC unveiled only 0.5 polyp >6 mm/patient and no smaller lesions were documented, whereas findings for the colon capsule comprised an average of 0.4 polyps >6 mm and 0.7 polyps <6 mm per patient. Statistical difference was not demonstrated, except for virtual colonoscopy in terms of the total number of polyps detected in comparison to optical colonoscopy. Conclusions Optical colonoscopy showed superior results in comparison to virtual colonoscopy while there was no statistical difference in comparison to colon capsule. Notwithstanding occasional difficulties, all three techniques were well tolerated. Hence, decisions concerning the use of each diagnostic method should be based on their availability, professional expertise, contraindications, and patient preferences.",2023,May,Cureus,15,5,e38410,,10.7759/cureus.38410,37273390,#1254,Sakai 2023,,,0

Mothers' and birthing parents' experiences with 1-day cognitive behavioural therapy-based workshops for postpartum depression: A descriptive qualitative study.,Varambally M; Layton H; Jack SM; Van Lieshout RJ,"WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SUBJECT?: One in five mothers and birthing parents are affected by postpartum depression (PPD), yet only a small proportion of those with PPD receive treatment. Given cost and accessibility barriers to treatment, brief therapies (e.g. 1 day) could help address PPD on a large scale, though understanding participants' unique experiences with this novel treatment will help guide its refinement and use. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This paper describes the experiences, perspectives and satisfaction of participants who attended a 1-day workshop for PPD. Participants appreciate being taught practical techniques and the receipt of social support from facilitators and other attendees in the group setting, while some recommended further 'booster sessions' to enhance effectiveness. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: One-day CBT-based workshops may be an effective, low-intensity treatment option that provides helpful skills and builds social networks for individuals with PPD. Additional post-workshop booster sessions may enhance participant satisfaction with this new treatment by providing a reinforcement of their learning and an opportunity to re-connect with other birthing parents. ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Postpartum depression (PPD) affects up to one in five mothers and birthing parents. Understanding their perceptions of therapeutic interventions is key to their effectiveness and scalability. AIM: The aim of the study was to understand participants' experiences attending an in-person or online 1-day cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based workshop for PPD and compare their experiences participating in either modality. METHOD: This descriptive qualitative study was embedded in two separate randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of 1-day CBT-based workshops for PPD delivered in-person or online. Responses were provided by 94 in-person and 95 online participants about their experiences. Content analysis was used to code and categorize the data. RESULTS: Participants appreciated learning skills to improve PPD symptoms and joining a community of individuals with shared experiences. Integrating practical coping techniques after the workshop was reported to be most useful, though some wanted additional post-workshop support. Online participants identified additional barriers to workshop engagement. DISCUSSION: Participants who attended either workshop found them to be valuable and effective. Participants valued psychoeducation, social connections and applying practical CBT techniques. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: One-day CBT-based workshops may be an accessible treatment option for individuals with PPD, providing new skills and social support, though some prefer to receive additional post-workshop support.",2023,Dec,J Psychiatr Ment Health Nurs,,,,,10.1111/jpm.13007,38078565,#570,Varambally 2023,,,0
"Discrete-Choice Experiment to Understand the Preferences of Patients with Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer in the USA, Canada, and the UK.",Gonzalez JM; Ganguli A; Morgans AK; Tombal BF; Hotte SJ; Suzuki H; Bhadauria H; Oh M; Scales CD Jr; Wallace MJ; Yang JC; George DJ,"BACKGROUND: Treatment options for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) have broadened, and treatment decisions can have a long-lasting impact on patients' quality of life. Data on patient preferences can improve therapeutic decision-making by helping physicians suggest treatments that align with patients' values and needs. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to quantify patient preferences for attributes of chemohormonal therapies among patients with mHSPC in the USA, Canada, and the UK. METHODS: A discrete-choice experiment survey instrument was developed and administered to patients with high- and very-high-risk localized prostate cancer and mHSPC. Patients chose between baseline androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) alone and experimentally designed, hypothetical treatment alternatives representing chemohormonal therapies. Choices were analyzed using logit models to derive the relative importance of attributes for each country and to evaluate differences and similarities among patients across countries. RESULTS: A total of 550 respondents completed the survey (USA, 200; Canada, 200; UK, 150); the mean age of respondents was 64.3 years. Treatment choices revealed that patients were most concerned with treatment efficacy. However, treatment-related convenience factors, such as route of drug administration and frequency of monitoring visits, were as important as some treatment-related side effects, such as skin rash, nausea, and fatigue. Patient preferences across countries were similar, although patients in Canada appeared to be more affected by concomitant steroid use. CONCLUSION: Patients with mHSPC believe the use of ADT alone is insufficient when more effective treatments are available. Efficacy is the most significant driver of patient choices. Treatment-related convenience factors can be as important as safety concerns for patients.",2023,Nov,Patient,16,6,607-623,,10.1007/s40271-023-00638-7,37566214,#729,Gonzalez 2023,,,1

We assessed preference data within a trial of the Genomics ADvISER, (SF decision aid) among adult cancer patients. Participants could choose from five categories of SF: (1) medically actionable; (2) polygenic risks; (3) rare diseases; (4) early-onset neurological diseases; and (5) carrier status. We analyzed preferences using descriptive statistics and drivers of preferences using multivariable logistic regression models. The 133 participants were predominantly European (74%) or East Asian or mixed ancestry (13%), female (90%), and aged > 50 years old (60%). The majority chose to receive SF. 97% (129/133) chose actionable findings with 36% (48/133) choosing all 5 categories. Despite the lack of medical actionability, participants were interested in receiving SF of polygenic risks (74%), carrier status (75%), rare diseases (59%), and early-onset neurologic diseases (53%). Older participants were more likely to be interested in receiving results for early-onset neurological diseases, while those exhibiting lower decisional conflict were more likely to select all categories. Our results highlight a disconnect between cancer patient preferences and professional guidelines on SF, such as ACMG's recommendations to only return medically actionable secondary findings.

Patient Preferences and Perceptions of Provider Diversity in Orthopaedic Surgery.,Chen M; Strony JT; Kroneberger EA; Karns MR; Salata MJ; Voos JE; Gillespie RJ; Brown MC,"BACKGROUND: Orthopaedic surgery in the U.S. historically has been among the least demographically diverse specialties in medicine. Currently, limited data exist on how patients perceive diversity within the field and what patients look for when choosing an orthopaedic surgeon. The purpose of this study was to identify specific patient preferences for surgeon demographics and understand patient perceptions of racial and gender diversity in orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: Nonconsecutive patients from orthopaedic clinics affiliated with a U.S. academic health system voluntarily completed a 39-item questionnaire that surveyed basic demographic information, perception of diversity, racial and gender preferences during surgeon selection, and perception of health-care inequalities. Bivariate analyses were used to test the association between patient-surgeon demographic variables and ratings of diversity. Multiple regression models were used to identify independent predictors of overall perceived diversity ratings. RESULTS: A total of 349 patients (80.6% White, 17.9% Black, and 1.5% other) were analyzed. Black patients were more likely to experience difficulty relating to their surgeon than White patients (11.48% versus 2.29%; odds ratio [OR], 5.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55 to 21.1; p = 0.004). Moreover, Black patients were more likely to perceive racial bias from their surgeon than White patients (5.17% versus 0.37%; OR, 14.44; 95% CI, 1.14 to 766.29; p = 0.02). While the level of racial diversity perceived by White patients (2.57 of 10) was significantly higher than that perceived by Black patients (2.10 of 10) (p = 0.001), the absolute difference between these 2 figures was small, suggesting that both groups perceived racial diversity in orthopaedics to be low. White and Black patients differed in their importance ranking of a surgeon's race (p < 0.0001): Black patients ranked a surgeon's race with higher importance (mean, 3.49 of 10) when selecting a surgeon compared with White patients (1.45 of 10). Both male and female patients gave relatively low importance rankings for a surgeon's gender (mean, 1.58 of 10 and 2.15 of 10, respectively, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients in this study did not perceive orthopaedic surgery as a diverse field (overall diversity rating, <3 of 10). There were significant racial and gender differences in patients' preferences for specific physician characteristics when choosing an orthopaedic surgeon, which may help explain some instances of perceived racial bias and difficulty relating to their orthopaedic surgeon.",2023,Nov,J Bone Joint Surg Am,105,21,1703-1708,,10.2106/JBJS.23.00071,37801560,#714,Chen 2023,,,0
The Impact of Socioeconomic Status on the Presence of Advance Care Planning Documents in Patients With Acute Cervical Spinal Cord Injury.,Issa TZ; McCurdy MA; Lee Y; Lambrechts MJ; Sherman MB; Kalra A; Goodman P; Canseco JA; Hilibrand AS; Vaccaro AR; Schroeder GD; Kepler CK,"INTRODUCTION: Patients presenting with spinal cord injury (SCI) often times have notable deficits or polytrauma and may require urgent decision making for early management. However, their presentation may affect decision-making ability. Although advance care planning (ACP) may help guide spine surgeons as to patient preferences, the rate at which they are available and disparities in ACP completion are still not understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate disparities in the completion of ACP among patients with acute SCI. METHODS: All patients presenting with cervical SCI to the emergency department at an urban, tertiary level I trauma center from 2010 to 2021 were identified from a prospective database of all consults evaluated by the spine service. Each patient's medical record was reviewed to assess for the presence of ACP documents such as living will, power of attorney, or advance directive. Community-level socioeconomic status was assessed using the Distressed Communities Index. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed. RESULTS: We identified 424 patients: 104 (24.5%) of whom had ACP. Patients with ACP were older (64.8 versus 56.5 years, P = 0.001), more likely White (78.8% versus 71.9%, P = 0.057), and present with ASIA Impairment Scale grade A SCI (21.2% versus 12.8%, P = 0.054), although the latter two did not reach statistical significance. On multivariable logistic regression, patients residing in at-risk communities were significantly less likely to have ACP documents compared with those in prosperous communities (odds ratio [OR]: 0.29, P = 0.03). Although patients living in distressed communities were less likely to complete ACP compared with those in prosperous communities (OR 0.50, P = 0.066), this did not meet statistical significance. Female patients were also less likely to have ACP (OR: 0.43, P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Female patients and those from at-risk communities are markedly less likely to complete ACP. Attention to possible disparities during admission and ACP discussions may help ensure that patients of all backgrounds have treatment goals documented.",2024,Apr,J Am Acad Orthop Surg,32,8,354-361,,10.5435/JAAOS-D-23-00763,38271675,#169,Issa 2024,,,0
Patient preferences for pilonidal sinus treatments: a discrete choice experiment survey.,Wickramasekera N; Strong E; Shackley P; Callaghan T; Lee M; Hind D; Brown S,"BACKGROUND: A range of treatments are available for pilonidal sinus disease (PSD), each of which has a different risk/benefit profile. The aim of this study was to collect patient views on which interventions they would rather avoid and which outcomes they most value for PSD. METHOD: We conducted an online survey using the discrete choice experiment (DCE) method. DCE task involved participants choosing the best treatment option when presented with a set of competing hypothetical treatment profiles. Participants with symptomatic PSD, referred for elective surgery were recruited from 33 NHS trusts between 2020 and 2022. Collected DCE data were analysed using regression analyses. RESULTS: One hundred and eleven participants completed the survey. In the overall group, low risk of infection/persistence was the most important characteristic when making a treatment decision (attribute importance score of 70%), followed by treatments with shorter recovery time with an attribute importance score of 30%. The results demonstrated that patients are willing to accept trade-offs between treatment recovery time and risk of infection/persistence. Patients above 30 years old are willing to accept a higher chance of treatment failure in exchange for rapid treatment recovery (risk tolerance between 22.35 - 34.67 percentage points). Conversely, patients in the younger age groups, were risk averse, and were only willing to accept a small risk 1.51-2.15 in exchange for a treatment with faster recovery time. All patient groups appear to the reject the excision and leave open technique due to the need for protracted nursing care. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the need for shared decision making when it comes to surgery for PSD.",2023,Jan,Colorectal Dis,,,,,10.1111/codi.16482,36636796,#1591,Wickramasekera 2023,,,1
What do patients want to know about surgery for low-risk thyroid cancer? A qualitative study.,Underwood HJ; Mott NM; Saucke MC; Roman BR; Voils CI; Pitt SC,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making about treatment for low-risk thyroid cancer requires patients and surgeons to work together to select treatment that best balances risks and expected outcomes with patient preferences and values. To participate, patients must be activated and ask questions. We aimed to characterize what topics patients prioritize during treatment decision-making. METHODS: We identified substantive questions by patients with low-risk (cT1-2, N0) thyroid cancer during audio-recorded consultations with 9 surgeons at 2 unique health care systems. Logistics questions were excluded. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify major themes among patients' questions and surgeon responses. RESULTS: Overall, 28 of 30 patients asked 253 substantive questions, with 2 patients not asking any substantive questions (median 8, range 0-25). Patients were 20 to 71 years old, mostly White (86.7%) and female (80.0%). The questions addressed extent of surgery, hormone supplementation, risk of cancer progression, radioactive iodine, and etiology of thyroid cancer. When patients probed for a recommendation regarding extent of surgery, surgeons often responded indirectly. When patients asked how surgery could impact quality of life, surgeons focused on oncologic benefits and surgical risk. Patients commonly asked about hormone supplementation and radioactive iodine. CONCLUSION: Patient questions focused on the decision regarding extent of surgery, quality of life, and nonsurgical aspects of thyroid cancer care. Surgeon responses do not consistently directly answer patients' questions but focus on the risks, benefits, and conduct of surgery itself. These findings suggest an opportunity to help surgeons with resources to improve shared decision-making by providing information that patients prioritize.",2023,Jan,Surgery,173,1,226-231,,10.1016/j.surg.2022.05.049,36336505,#1644,Underwood 2023,,,0
Adaptation of the WOMAC for Use in a Patient Preference Study.,Stothers Rosenberg S; Ng X; Mansfield C; Poulos C; Peay H; Lee TH; Irony T; Ho M,"OBJECTIVES: To adapt a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure, the Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), into efficacy attributes for a discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey designed to quantify the relative importance of endpoints commonly used in knee osteoarthritis (KOA) trials. METHODS: The adaptation comprised four steps: (1) selecting domains of interest; (2) determining presentation and framing of selected attributes; (3) determining attribute levels; and (4) developing choice tasks. This process involved input from multiple stakeholders, including regulators, health preference researchers, and patients. Pretesting was conducted to evaluate if patients comprehended the adapted survey attributes and could make trade-offs among them. RESULTS: The WOMAC pain and function domains were selected for adaption to two efficacy attributes. Two versions of the discrete choice experiment (DCE) instrument were created to compare efficacy using (1) total domain scores and (2) item scores for ""walking on a flat surface."" Both attributes were presented as improvement from baseline scores by levels of 0%, 30%, 50%, and 100%. Twenty-six participants were interviewed in a pretest of the instrument (average age 60 years; 58% female; 62% had KOA for ≥ 5 years). The participants found both versions of attributes meaningful and relevant for treatment decision-making. They demonstrated willingness and ability to tradeoff improvements in pain and function separately, though many perceived them as inter-related. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the growing literature regarding adapting PRO measures for patient preference studies. Such adaptation is important for designing a preference study that can incorporate a clinical trial's outcomes with PRO endpoints.",2023,Jul,Ther Innov Regul Sci,57,4,702-711,,10.1007/s43441-023-00510-8,37061632,#1122,StothersRosenberg 2023,,,1
Research recruitment and consent methods in a pandemic: a qualitative study of COVID-19 patients' perspectives.,Small SS; Lau E; McFarlane K; Archambault PM; Longstaff H; Hohl CM,"BACKGROUND: Virtual data collection methods and consent procedures adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic enabled continued research activities, but also introduced concerns about equity, inclusivity, representation, and privacy. Recent studies have explored these issues from institutional and researcher perspectives, but there is a need to explore patient perspectives and preferences. This study aims to explore COVID-19 patients' perspectives about research recruitment and consent for research studies about COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory qualitative focus group and interview study among British Columbian adults who self-identified as having had COVID-19. We recruited participants through personal contacts, social media, and REACH BC, an online platform that connects researchers and patients in British Columbia. We analyzed transcripts inductively and developed thematic summaries of each coding element. RESULTS: Of the 22 individuals recruited, 16 attended a focus group or interview. We found that autonomy and the feasibility of participation, attitudes toward research about COVID-19, and privacy concerns are key factors that influence participants' willingness to participate in research. We also found that participants preferred remote and virtual approaches for contact, consent, and delivery of research on COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who had COVID-19 are motivated to participate in research studies and value autonomy in their decision to participate, but researchers must be sensitive and considerate toward patient preferences and concerns, particularly as researchers adopt virtual recruitment and data collection methods. Such awareness may increase research participation and engagement.",2023,May,BMC Med Res Methodol,23,1,113,,10.1186/s12874-023-01933-5,37170077,#1241,Small 2023,,,0
Management reasoning and patient-clinician interactions: Insights from shared decision-making and simulated outpatient encounters.,Cook DA; Hargraves IG; Stephenson CR; Durning SJ,"PURPOSE: To expand understanding of patient-clinician interactions in management reasoning. METHODS: We reviewed 10 videos of simulated patient-clinician encounters to identify instances of problematic and successful communication, then reviewed the videos again through the lens of two models of shared decision-making (SDM): an 'involvement-focused' model and a 'problem-focused' model. Using constant comparative qualitative analysis we explored the connections between these patient-clinician interactions and management reasoning. RESULTS: Problems in patient-clinician interactions included failures to: encourage patient autonomy; invite the patient's involvement in decision-making; convey the health impact of the problem; explore and address concerns and questions; explore the context of decision-making (including patient preferences); meet the patient where they are; integrate situational preferences and priorities; offer >1 viable option; work with the patient to solve a problem of mutual concern; explicitly agree to a final care plan; and build the patient-clinician relationship. Clinicians' 'management scripts' varied along a continuum of prioritizing clinician vs patient needs. Patients also have their own cognitive scripts that guide their interactions with clinicians. The involvement-focused and problem-focused SDM models illuminated distinct, complementary issues. CONCLUSIONS: Management reasoning is a deliberative interaction occurring in the space between individuals. Juxtaposing management reasoning alongside SDM generated numerous insights.",2023,Sep,Med Teach,45,9,1025-1037,,10.1080/0142159X.2023.2170776,36763491,#952,Cook 2023,,,0
Evidence-based review of nonantibiotic urinary tract infection prevention strategies for women: a patient-centered approach.,Stair SL; Palmer CJ; Lee UJ,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is a growing interest in nonantibiotic prevention strategies for recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs). Our objective is to provide a focused, pragmatic review of the latest evidence. RECENT FINDINGS: Vaginal estrogen is well tolerated and effective for preventing rUTI in postmenopausal women. Cranberry supplements at sufficient doses are effective in preventing uncomplicated rUTI. Methenamine, d -mannose, and increased hydration all have evidence to support their use, although the evidence is of somewhat variable quality. SUMMARY: There is sufficient evidence to recommend vaginal estrogen and cranberry as first-line rUTI prevention strategies, particularly in postmenopausal women.

Patient Preferences for Attributes that Characterise Alternative Models of Care in Gastroenterology: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,Mutsekwa RN; Campbell KL; Canavan R; Mulhern B; Angus RL; Byrnes JM,"OBJECTIVES: Increased demand for gastroenterology services has resulted in growing waitlists, with patients at risk of exceeding clinically recommended wait-times. Given limited healthcare resources, expanded scope models of care are an option to help address this demand, but little is known about patient preferences for these models of care. METHODS: Low-risk gastroenterology patients (n = 1198) referred to an outpatient tertiary service in Australia over a 2-year period were invited to participate in an unlabelled discrete choice experiment with seven attributes: primary healthcare professional, wait-time, continuity of care, consultation length, manner and communication skills, reassurance, and cost. These were developed using qualitative research, literature review, and stakeholders' experiences. A d-efficient fractional design was used to construct four blocks of 12 choice sets, with two alternatives. A 13th choice set was included as a data and quality check. Latent class and mixed logit regression were used for analysis. The resulting preference parameters for individual attributes were then used to calculate willingness to pay and willingness to wait. RESULTS: Overall, the model based on the 347 respondents suggested no strong preference for professional background. All other attributes were statistically significant predictors of preference (p < 0.001), with respondents willing to make significant trade-offs (time and cost) before accepting deterioration in attributes. There was strong emphasis on manner and communication skills, with a clinician who listens and provides good explanations overwhelmingly the most important attribute. Latent class analysis identified two patient segments who differed in their preference for the primary treating healthcare professional (doctor or dietitian) based on exposure to either traditional medical or non-medical professional role substitution model. CONCLUSIONS: Patients have strong but varied preferences for gastroenterology services based on whether they have been exposed to expanded scope models of care. Design and implementation of new models of care need to consider strategies to overcome any perceived loss in utility or deterioration in healthcare quality for those unfamiliar with professional role substitution.",2023,Mar,Patient,16,2,165-177,,10.1007/s40271-022-00609-4,36637751,#1456,Mutsekwa 2023,,,1
Patient Preferences for Pharmacy Services: A Systematic Review of Studies Based on Discrete Choice Experiments.,Riboulet M; Clairet AL; Bennani M; Nerich V,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In recent years, the mission of pharmacists has evolved and the model of the caregiver-patient relationship has been challenged by a new patient-centered approach. A challenge to providing personalized care is the assessment of patient preferences. We aimed to systematically identify published discrete choice experiments related to patient preferences for pharmacy services and to assess the quality of the selected articles. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted in two databases (PubMed and Embase, until March 2023) according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. The quality of the selected articles was assessed according to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research conjoint analysis checklist. RESULTS: Among the 421 articles identified, 16 published studies were included and analyzed. They were mostly published in pharmaceutical (n = 6), economic (n = 4), and public health (n = 4) journals. Only two articles concerned the field of hospital pharmacy. Only five presented the specific pharmacy service studied: filling of prescriptions, management of symptoms, treatment delivery, and components of pharmacist counseling. Five articles focused on pharmacy services related to a specific disease. None fully fulfilled the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research checklist, only partially fulfilled. CONCLUSIONS: According to the identified studies, cost, time, logistics (organizational criteria), and pharmacists' courtesy and skills were consistently cited as factors influencing patient preferences for pharmacy services. The disclosure of patient preferences is a complex and under-researched topic, especially in the field of pharmacy, but interest is growing. As the mission of pharmacists evolves to bring them closer to patients, the better understanding of patient preferences in pharmacy services will allow for better targeting and better integration of patient profiles in patient management.",2024,Jan,Patient,17,1,13-24,,10.1007/s40271-023-00652-9,38093090,#508,Riboulet 2024,,,1
Treatment Preferences in Young Adults with Moderate to Severe Psoriasis: A Qualitative Study from the Nordic Countries.,Balieva FN; Catton L; Claréus BW; Danielsen K; Fierens F; Iversen L; Koulu L; Osmanecevic A; Pasternack R; Skov L,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to explore treatment preferences and identify patient characteristics in young bio-naive adults with moderate to severe psoriasis in the Nordic countries (Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Denmark). METHODS: Patients were 18-45 years old and bio-naive but referred for biologic treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. Patients were included at eight Nordic dermatology clinics. Patients with significant comorbidity or psoriatic arthritis were excluded. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) were assessed along with basic patient information. A semistructured interview guide was used in individual qualitative interviews, asking patients about their treatment preferences and reasons, disease journey, and disease management. The interviews were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Twenty-four patients sufficed to reach saturation in this qualitative study. RESULTS: The patient sample characteristics represented a qualitative variation in age, sex, symptoms, duration of disease, and country. We included a total of 12 male and 12 female patients. The mean age was 34 years (range 18-45 years), the mean age at diagnosis was 20 years (range 6-34 years), the mean ± standard deviation (SD) time since diagnosis was 13 ± 8 years, PASI was 9.5 ± 4.7, and DLQI was 15.2 ± 6.4. Interviews suggested that both the burden of disease as well as the burden of treatment influenced patient preferences regarding treatment attributes, hence getting alleviation from symptoms did not alone influence patient preferences. Time, effort, and inconvenience related to psoriasis treatments also influenced patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: This first in-depth, qualitative study in young bio-naive adults with psoriasis suggests that patient preferences are focusing not only on symptom relief but also on alleviating the burden of psoriasis treatment. Understanding the reasons for patient preferences and the perspectives of young adults is needed to guide individual shared decision-making in psoriasis management.",2023,Aug,Dermatol Ther (Heidelb),13,8,1873-1887,,10.1007/s13555-023-00973-5,37452929,#1003,Balieva 2023,,,1
Exploring Patient Adherence to Post-Surgical Follow-Up in Pelvic Endometriosis.,Szabo T; Mitranovici MI; Crisan A; Melinte IM; Cotrus T; Tudorache V; Moraru L; Moraru R; Micu R,"Endometriosis is a significant cause of disability that affects 5-10% of reproductive-aged women. Laparoscopy with histological confirmation is the gold standard in establishing the diagnosis as therapeutic management surgery is addressed to a certain category of patients. The objective of this study was to assess patient adherence to follow-up after surgery for endometriosis as the primary endpoint, pain symptoms, quality of life, mental health, and fertility as the secondary endpoints. We have analyzed patients' adherence to follow-up after surgery for endometriosis after 1, 3, 5, and 7 years. Out of the 2538 total number of surgeries, 453 patients replied just to the first questionnaire (group A), 528 to the first and second (group B), and only 356 carried out the entire follow-up schedule. General health was significantly lower for group A (46.6 vs. 56.4) but with no statistical difference in the post-surgical improvement in both groups. Pain level score improvement was lower for group A (10.5 vs. 18.8), which is statistically significant. In this light, laparoscopy still remains the gold standard in diagnosis only. Furthermore, no malignancy was discovered. The mental component was improved by laparoscopy based on SF-36 in group B.

Adherence to evidence-based implementation of antimicrobial treatment guidelines among prescribers in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Boltena MT; Woldie M; Siraneh Y; Steck V; El-Khatib Z; Morankar S,"BACKGROUND: Adherence to evidence-based standard treatment guidelines (STGs) enable healthcare providers to deliver consistently appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Irrational use of antimicrobials significantly contributes to antimicrobial resistance in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).  The best available evidence is needed to guide healthcare providers on adherence to evidence-based implementation of STGs. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of adherence to evidence-based implementation of antimicrobial treatment guidelines among prescribers in SSA. METHODS: The review followed the JBI methodology for systematic reviews of prevalence data. CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched with no language and publication year limitations. STATA version 17 were used for meta-analysis. The publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed using Egger's test and the I(2) statistics. Heterogeneity and publication bias were validated using Duval and Tweedie's nonparametric trim and fill analysis using the random-effect analysis. The summary prevalence and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of healthcare professionals' compliance with evidence-based implementation of STG were estimated using random effect model. The review protocol has been registered with PROSPERO code CRD42023389011. The PRISMA flow diagram and checklist were used to report studies included, excluded and their corresponding section in the manuscript. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies with a total of 17,017 study participants from 14 countries in sub-Saharan Africa were included. The pooled prevalence of adherence to evidence-based implementation of antimicrobial treatment guidelines in SSA were 45%. The pooled prevalence of the most common clinical indications were respiratory tract (35%) and gastrointestinal infections (18%). Overall prescriptions per wards were inpatients (14,413) and outpatients (12,845). Only 391 prescribers accessed standard treatment guidelines during prescription of antimicrobials. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals' adherence to evidence-based implementation of STG for antimicrobial treatment were low in SSA. Healthcare systems in SSA must make concerted efforts to enhance prescribers access to STGs through optimization of mobile clinical decision support applications. Innovative, informative, and interactive strategies must be in place by the healthcare systems in SSA to empower healthcare providers to make evidence-based clinical decisions informed by the best available evidence and patient preferences, to ultimately improving patient outcomes and promoting appropriate antimicrobial use.",2023,Nov,J Pharm Policy Pract,16,1,137,,10.1186/s40545-023-00634-0,37936215,#691,Boltena 2023,,,0
An Electronic Shared Decision-Making App to Improve Asthma Outcomes: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,Lee DL; Hammond JW; Finkel K; Gardner DD; Nelson B; Baptist AP,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making (SDM) incorporates patient values and preferences to optimize asthma management decisions. Available asthma SDM aids primarily focus on medication selection. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usability, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of an electronic SDM application, the ACTION (Active Conversation in asthma Treatment shared decisION-making) app, that addressed medication, nonmedication, and COVID-19 concerns for asthma. METHODS: In this pilot study, 81 participants with asthma were randomized into the control arm or ACTION app intervention. The ACTION app was completed 1 week before a clinic visit, and responses were shared with the medical provider. The primary outcomes were patient satisfaction and SDM quality. Next, ACTION app users (n = 9) and providers (n = 5) provided feedback through separate virtual focus groups. Sessions were coded by comparative analysis. RESULTS: The ACTION app group scored higher agreement that providers adequately addressed COVID-19 concerns compared with the control group (4.4 vs 3.7, P = .03). Although the ACTION app group had a higher total 9-item Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire score, this did not reach statistical significance (87.1 vs 83.3, P = .2). However, the ACTION app group demonstrated stronger agreement that their physician knew exactly how they wanted to be involved in decision-making (4.3 vs 3.8, P = .05), providers asked about preferences (4.3 vs 3.8, P = .05), and that different options were thoroughly weighed (4.3 vs 3.8, P = .03). Major focus group themes included that the ACTION app was practical and established a patient-centered agenda.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort, we included patients treated with ICI for aUC after having prior ICI treatment. Endpoints included the evaluation of radiographic response and disease control rates with first and second ICI courses, outcomes based on whether there was a change in ICI class (anti-PD-1 vs. anti-PD-L1), and assessment of the reasons for ICI discontinuation. RESULTS: We identified 25 patients with aUC from 9 institutions who received 2 separate ICI courses. ORR with first ICI and second ICI were 39% and 13%, respectively. Most patients discontinued first ICI due to progression (n = 19) or treatment-related toxicity (n = 4). Thirteen patients received non-ICI treatment between the first and second ICI, and 12 patients changed ICI class (anti-PD-1 vs. anti-PD-L1) at rechallenge. Among 10 patients who changed ICI class, 8 (80%) had progressive disease as best response with second ICI, while among 12 patients re-treated with the same ICI class, only 3 (25%) had progressive disease as best response at the time of rechallenge. With second ICI, most patients discontinued treatment due to progression (n = 18) or patient preference (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: A proportion of patients with aUC rechallenged with ICI-based regimens may achieve disease control, supporting clinical trials in that setting, especially with ICI-based combinations.

[Do clothes make the psychiatrist? Psychiatrists and patients on psychiatrists' dress style and form of address].,Van Herzeele T; Vansteelandt K; Bouckaert F,"BACKGROUND: Both the way a psychiatrist dresses and the way he gets addressed can have an impact on the therapeutic relationship. Most psychiatrists have stopped wearing white coats and dress less formally than before. AIM: To identify psychiatrists&rsquo; and patients&rsquo; preferences regarding psychiatrists&rsquo; style of dress and form of address. To test if certain styles of dress are linked to competence or accessibility. METHODS: A total of 143 respondents, of which 35 psychiatrists and 108 patients, filled out structured questionnaires with pictures. RESULTS: Psychiatrists, and both minor and adult patients, preferred psychiatrists to dress formally while elderly patients prefer them to wear white coats. The formal dress style and white coat were perceived as more competent than the informal style. Psychiatrists thought a white coat is regarded less accessible than a formal dress style and a formal dress style less accessible than an informal one. Adult patients regarded a white coat as less accessible than formal and informal dress styles. In elderly and minor patients no differences were seen in perceived accessibility for the three dress styles. Both psychiatrists and patients preferred a psychiatrist to be addressed with &lsquo;doctor&rsquo; and a patient with his/her first name. CONCLUSIONS: It seems a good choice for a psychiatrist to go formally dressed, let them be addressed by their title, and address patients by their first name.",2023,,Tijdschr Psychiatr,65,6,368-375,,,37434577,#1615,VanHerzeele 2023,,,0
In-Hospital Code Status Updates: Trends Over Time and the Impact of COVID-19.,Sahebi-Fakhrabad A; Kemahlioglu-Ziya E; Handfield R; Wood S; Patel MD; Page CP; Chang L,"OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to evaluate if the percentage of patients with missing or inaccurate code status documentation at a Trauma Level 1 hospital could be reduced through daily updates. The secondary objective was to examine if patient preferences for DNR changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective study, spanning March 2019 to December 2022, compared the code status in ICU and ED patients drawn from two data sets. The first was based on historical electronic medical records (EHR), and the second involved daily updates of code status following patient admission. RESULTS: Implementing daily updates upon admission was more effective in ICUs than in the ED in reducing missing code status documentation. Around 20% of patients without a specific code status chose DNR under the new system. During COVID-19, a decrease in ICU patients choosing DNR and an increase in full code (FC) choices were observed. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of regular updates and discussions regarding code status to enhance patient care and resource allocation in ICU and ED settings. The COVID-19 pandemic's influence on shifting patient preferences towards full code status underscores the need for adaptable documentation practices. Emphasizing patient education about DNR implications and benefits is key to supporting informed decisions that reflect individual health contexts and values. This approach will help balance the considerations for DNR and full code choices, especially during health care crises.",2023,Dec,Am J Hosp Palliat Care,,,10499091231222188,,10.1177/10499091231222188,38111223,#560,Sahebi-Fakhrabad 2023,,,0
Pretrichial Brow Lift.,Dunn T; Hohman MH,"Patients commonly present with chief complaints of ""droopy eyes"" or similar phrases, but ""droopy eyes"" often mean different things. In many cases, the anatomical issue in question is upper eyelid dermatochalasis. Sometimes, there may also be pseudoherniated fat in the upper eyelid or even lacrimal gland ptosis. Blepharoptosis commonly occurs with age as well, but what patients frequently overlook is the contribution of brow ptosis to the appearance of aging in the periorbital area and to upper visual field deficits. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the surgeon to evaluate the periorbital area thoroughly and to identify which patients are candidates for brow lifting, which may or may not be performed in conjunction with upper eyelid surgery, and then further to determine the optimal approach for brow lifting in the individual patient. In this article, we discuss the pretrichial brow lift approach, its benefits, and its limitations. Since the first description of surgical brow lifting by Passot in 1919, myriad techniques have evolved to improve results. The traditional coronal approach was the first of the modern approaches developed in 1926 and was followed shortly thereafter by trichophytic and pretrichial variants. Direct, midforehead, temporal, endoscopic, and transblepharoplasty approaches followed over the ensuing 70 years. As technology in facial plastic surgery has advanced and the focus has shifted towards minimally invasive procedures, endoscopic and transblepharoplasty techniques have gained popularity over open approaches. However, the coronal incision and its variants are still commonly employed in the following situations: Revision brow lifting after minimally invasive surgery that did not produce the desired result. Advancing the frontal hairline while simultaneously performing a brow lift for aging face indications. Advancing the frontal hairline while providing access for frontal cranioplasty in gender affirmation surgery for transgender females. Accessing the frontal sinus, naso-orbito-ethmoid (NOE) region, brain, or anterior skull base for post-traumatic reconstruction or oncologic resection. Accessing the frontal pericranium for the development of an osteoplastic flap. The choice of approach between coronal and pretrichial/trichophytic depends on whether any adjustment to the frontal hairline is necessary. A traditional coronal approach across the vertex of the scalp will elevate the hairline commensurately with the width of the scalp strip excised. Pretrichial/trichophytic approaches tend not to elevate the hairline and may even be used to lower it, if necessary. The choice between pretrichial and trichophytic approaches is generally based on surgeon and patient preference. The pretrichial approach places the incision directly anterior to the hairline, whereas the trichophytic approach runs a few millimeters posterior to the hairline in order to hide the scar. In some cases, such as for hairline adjustment, the incision may run partially anterior to the hairline and partially within it.",2024,Jan,,,,,,,34033394,#540,Dunn 2024,,,0
Patient Preferences for Investigating Cancer-Related Symptoms in Australian General Practice: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,Venning B; Pearce A; De Abreu Lourenco R; Hall R; Bergin R; Lee A; Donohoe K; Emery J,"BACKGROUND: Striking the right balance between early cancer diagnosis and the risk of excessive testing for low-risk symptoms is of paramount importance. Patient-centred care must also consider patient preferences for testing. AIM: To investigate diagnostic testing preferences of the Australian public for symptoms associated with oesophagogastric (OG), bowel, or lung cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: One of three discrete choice experiments (DCEs) related to either OG, bowel, or lung cancer were administered to a nationally representative sample of Australians aged 40 and above. METHODS: Each DCE comprised three scenarios with symptom positive predictive values (PPVs) for undiagnosed cancer ranging from 1% to 3%. The numerical risk was concealed from participants. DCE attributes encompassed the testing strategy, GP familiarity, test and result waiting times, travel duration, and test cost. Preferences were estimated using conditional and mixed logit models. RESULTS: A total of 3013 individuals participated in one of three DCEs: OG (n=1004), Bowel (n=1006), and Lung (n=1003). Preferences were chiefly driven by waiting time, test cost followed by the test type. There was preference for more invasive tests. When confronted with symptoms carrying an extremely low risk (symptom PPV of 1% or less), participants were more inclined to abstain from testing. CONCLUSIONS: Access-related factors, particularly waiting times and testing costs, emerged as the most pivotal elements influencing preferences, underscoring the substantial impact of these systemic factors on patient choices regarding investigations.",2024,Feb,Br J Gen Pract,,,,,10.3399/BJGP.2023.0583,38395444,#344,Venning 2024,,,1
Taking a chance: How likely am I to receive my preferred treatment in a clinical trial?,Walter SD; Blaha O; Esserman D,"Researchers should ideally conduct clinical trials under a presumption of clinical equipoise, but in fact trial patients will often prefer one or other of the treatments being compared. Receiving an unblinded preferred treatment may affect the study outcome, possibly beneficially, but receiving a non-preferred treatment may induce 'reluctant acquiescence', and poorer outcomes. Even in blinded trials, patients' primary motivation to enrol may be the chance of potentially receiving a desirable experimental treatment, which is otherwise unavailable. Study designs with a higher probability of receiving a preferred treatment (denoted as 'concordance') will be attractive to potential participants, and investigators, because they may improve recruitment and hence enhance study efficiency. Therefore, it is useful to consider the concordance rates associated with various study designs. We consider this question with a focus on comparing the standard, randomised, two-arm, parallel group design with the two-stage randomised patient preference design and Zelen designs; we also mention the fully randomised and partially randomised patient preference designs. For each of these designs, we evaluate the concordance rate as a function of the proportions randomised to the alternative treatments, the distribution of preferences over treatments, and (for the Zelen designs) the proportion of patients who consent to receive their assigned treatment. We also examine the equity of each design, which we define as the similarity between the concordance rates for participants with different treatment preferences. Finally, we contrast each of the alternative designs with the standard design in terms of gain in concordance and change in equity.",2023,Mar,Stat Methods Med Res,32,3,572-592,,10.1177/09622802221146305,36628522,#1460,Walter 2023,,,0
Outpatient and Minor Burn Treatment.,Chipp E,"Burn injuries are common; most burn injuries may be considered minor and are suitable for outpatient management. Steps should be taken to ensure that patients managed in this way still retain access to the full burns multidisciplinary team, and that admission remains an option if complications develop or according to patient preference.

Factors Important to Patient Decision-Making After Ulnar Collateral Ligament Injury in Competitive High School and Collegiate Baseball Players.,Bixby EC; Ahmed R; Skaggs K; Swindell HW; Fortney TA; Ahmad CS,"BACKGROUND: Patients are faced with several treatment decisions after an ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injury: nonoperative versus operative treatment, repair versus reconstruction, and immediate versus delayed surgery. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to investigate the factors important to patients when deciding which treatment to pursue after a UCL injury. We hypothesized that (1) length of time away from sports and seasonal timing would be important to patients and (2) treatment decision-making would be heavily influenced by how many and which seasons of their baseball career would be missed. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: High school and collegiate baseball players with UCL tears treated at an academic institution were surveyed retrospectively on their sports participation at the time of injury and their UCL injury treatment decisions. Respondents rated the influence of various factors on a 5-point Likert scale, and they selected the top 3 factors and the single most important factor influencing their treatment decisions. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between player characteristics and factors important to their treatment decision. RESULTS: A total of 83 athletes completed the survey; 40 were in high school and 43 were in college at the time of injury; 7 were treated nonoperatively and 76 underwent surgery (66 immediately and 10 in a delayed fashion), 10 with UCL repair and 66 with UCL reconstruction. The ability to play competitive baseball in the long term was very important or extremely important to 90% of players, while the ability to play in the short term was very important or extremely important to 17%. Length of recovery and seasonal timing were also important factors for 53% and 54% of players, respectively, and almost all (90%) highly valued advice from a surgeon. Possible failure of nonoperative treatment leading to increased time away and the possible loss of 2 consecutive baseball seasons heavily influenced decision-making in 41% of respondents. CONCLUSION: Survey respondents were driven by the desire to play baseball in the long term. Treatment decisions were influenced by the length of recovery and by the seasonal timing of their injury, both of which affect how many and which seasons of baseball a player may miss. Patients found advice from their surgeon to be extremely important to decision-making.",2023,Jul,Orthop J Sports Med,11,7,23259671231183486,,10.1177/23259671231183486,37465208,#1060,Bixby 2023,,,0
Effectiveness of a peer educator-coordinated preference-based differentiated service delivery model on viral suppression among young people living with HIV in Lesotho: The PEBRA cluster-randomized trial.,Kopo M; Lejone TI; Tschumi N; Glass TR; Kao M; Brown JA; Seiler O; Muhairwe J; Moletsane N; Labhardt ND; Amstutz A,"BACKGROUND: Southern and Eastern Africa is home to more than 2.1 million young people aged 15 to 24 years living with HIV. As compared with other age groups, this population group has poorer outcomes along the HIV care cascade. Young people living with HIV and the research team co-created the PEBRA (Peer Educator-Based Refill of ART) care model. In PEBRA, a peer educator (PE) delivered services as per regularly assessed patient preferences for medication pick-up, short message service (SMS) notifications, and psychosocial support. The cluster-randomized trial compared PEBRA model versus standard clinic care (no PE and ART refill done by nurses) in 3 districts in Lesotho. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Individuals taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) aged 15 to 24 years at 20 clinics (clusters) were eligible. In the 10 clinics randomized to the intervention arm, participants were offered the PEBRA model, coordinated by a trained PE and supported by an eHealth application (PEBRApp). In the 10 control clusters, participants received standard nurse-coordinated care without any service coordination by a PE. The primary endpoint was 12-month viral suppression below 20 copies/mL. Analyses were intention-to-treat and adjusted for sex. From November 6, 2019 to February 4, 2020, we enrolled 307 individuals (150 intervention, 157 control; 218 [71%] female, median age 19 years [interquartile range, IQR, 17 to 22]). At 12 months, 99 of 150 (66%) participants in the intervention versus 95 of 157 (61%) participants in the control arm had viral suppression (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.79 to 2.03]; p = 0.327); 4 of 150 (2.7%) versus 1 of 157 (0.6%) had died (adjusted OR 4.12; 95% CI [0.45 to 37.62]; p = 0.210); and 12 of 150 (8%) versus 23 of 157 (14.7%) had transferred out (adjusted OR 0.53; 95% CI [0.25 to 1.13]; p = 0.099). There were no significant differences between arms in other secondary outcomes. Twenty participants (11 in intervention and 9 in control) were lost to follow-up over the entire study period. The main limitation was that the data collectors in the control clusters were also young peers; however, they used a restricted version of the PEBRApp to collect data and thus were not able to provide the PEBRA model. The trial was prospectively registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03969030). CONCLUSIONS: Preference-based peer-coordinated care for young people living with HIV, compared to nurse-based care only, did not lead to conclusive evidence for an effect on viral suppression.

Preference for primary care in Chinese homebound patients.,Zhang J; Sun X; Yao A,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the preference for primary healthcare (PHC) and investigate associated factors among homebound residents in both rural and urban areas of China. It provides valuable insights to facilitate the rational allocation of healthcare resources and promote the utilization of PHC. METHODS: In this nationally representative cross-sectional study, we utilized the most recent data (2020) from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). Participants were recruited from 25 provincial-level administrative regions in both rural and urban areas of China. Homebound patients were asked to provide details about their individual characteristics, variables related to family caregiving, and preferences for PHC. Multivariable logistic models were used to analyze potential factors associated with preference for PHC. Estimates of association were reported as odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The study found that 58.43% of rural patients reported a preference for PHC, while 42.78% of urban patients favored PHC. Compared to rural participants who did not received inpatient care in the past year, those who received inpatient care in the past year had 67% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR:0.33, 95% CI:0.19-0.59); Compared to rural participants who did not received family caregiving when ill, those who received family caregiving when ill had 59% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.41, 95% CI:0.21-0.77). Correspondingly, Compared to urban participants who did not received inpatient care in the past year, those who had received inpatient care in the past year had 75% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.10-0.56); Compared to urban participants who did not received family caregiving when ill, those who received family caregiving when ill had 73% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.11-0.63); Compared to urban participants who with agricultural Hukou, those with Non-agricultural Hukou had 61% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.39, 95% CI:0.18-0.83); Compared to urban participants living in the eastern part of mainland China, those living in the central part of China had 188% higher odds of choosing PHC (OR: 2.88, 95% CI: 1.14-7.29). CONCLUSION: Policymakers should focus on tailoring PHC to vulnerable populations and prioritizing family-based public health strategies for enhancing homebound patients' perceptions of PHC. Furthermore, further study is needed on whether the Hukou registration system affects the barriers that homebound patients experience in choosing healthcare providers.",2024,Feb,BMC Public Health,24,1,449,,10.1186/s12889-024-17910-6,38347463,#375,Zhang 2024,,,0
Dutch prostate cancer patients' views about exercise and experience with exercise advice: a national survey.,Joosten MM; Depenbusch J; Samuel T; Aaronson NK; Steindorf K; Stuiver MM,"PURPOSE: To support the development and implementation of exercise programming for people with prostate cancer (PC), we investigated their views on exercise. METHODS: Online survey with open recruitment. We collected data on clinical and sociodemographic variables, experiences with exercise advice, outcome expectations, and preferences. We explored determinants of (1) having been counselled about exercise and (2) preferring supervised exercise. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 171 patients (mean age = 70 years, SD = 6.5) from all PC treatment pathways. Sixty-three percent of the respondents reported never having been informed about the potential benefits of exercise. Forty-nine percent preferred exercise to be supervised. Respondents generally reported a positive attitude towards exercise. Seventy-four percent indicated barriers to exercising, including fatigue and lack of access to specific programmes. Outcome expectations were generally positive but moderately strong. Receiving hormonal therapy and younger age were significantly associated with having received exercise advice. Being insured and having higher fatigue levels contributed significantly to the preference for supervised exercise. CONCLUSION: Dutch people with PC report receiving insufficient effective exercise counselling. Yet, they are open to exercise and expect exercise to improve their health, although they experience various barriers that limit their ability to exercise. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: The moderate outcome expectations for exercise of people with PC and their limited recall of exercise counselling highlight the need for better integration of exercise in clinical pathways. The lack of access to specific programming limits the use of evidence-based exercise programmes for people with PC.",2023,Mar,J Cancer Surviv,,,1-11,,10.1007/s11764-023-01368-3,36995565,#1394,Joosten 2023,,,0

[Analysis of the experience and procedural complications of trans-radial access versus trans-femoral access for hepatic arterial perfusion chemotherapy in patients with advanced hepatic malignancies:a retrospective study].,Lyu TY; Li M; He JA; Sun QF; Wang L; Qin H; Yu HP,"Objective: To analyze the differences between trans-radial access (TRA) and trans-femoral access (TFA) in hepatic arterial perfusion chemotherapy (HAIC) in terms of patient experience, postoperative complications, and patient preferences; explore whether TRA in HAIC is associated with better patient experience and compliance; and determine whether it is safer than TFA. Methods: The study was a retrospective cohort study of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastases from colorectal cancer treated with HAIC. We enrolled a total of 91 patients with advanced liver malignancies treated with HAIC from November 2022 to May 2023 in the Department of Interventional Therapy and Hepatobiliary Medicine at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital. The patients were divided into three groups: group TRA (n=20, receiving TRA HAIC only), group TFA (n=33, receiving TFA HAIC only), and crossover group [n=19, receiving TFA HAIC (Cross-TFA group) first, followed by TRA HAIC (Cross-TRA group)]. Meanwhile, to facilitate the expression of partial results, all patients receiving TRA HAIC were defined as the TRA-HAIC group (n=39, TRA+Cross-TRA group), and all patients receiving TFA HAIC were defined as the TFA-HAIC group (n=52, TFA+Cross-TFA group). The primary research index was the Quality of Life (QOL) visualization scale score. The secondary research index included approach-related and catheter-related adverse events, duration of surgery, and mean length of patient stay. We used various statistical methods such as Mann-Whitney U test, t-test, Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, univariate logistic regression analysis, and multi-factor analysis. Results: TRA patients had significantly lower QOL scores than TFA patients (all P<0.001). The QOL scores of the Cross-TRA group were significantly lower than those of the Cross-TFA group (pain at the puncture site Z=-3.24, P=0.001, others P<0.001). The QOL scores of the Cross-TRA group were compared with those of the TRA group, which showed that the scores of the Cross-TRA group in overall discomfort (Z=-3.07,P=0.002), postoperative toilet difficulty (Z=-2.12, P=0.034), and walking difficulty (Z=-2.58, P=0.010) were significantly lower than those of the TRA group. Satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the Cross-TRA group than in the Cross-TFA group (Z=-3.78, P<0.001), and patients were more likely to receive TRA HAIC as the next procedure (χ(2)=30.42, P<0.001). In terms of mean length of stay, patients receiving TRA HAIC had a significantly lower mean length of stay than those receiving TFA HAIC (50.1±3.2 h vs. 58.4±6.4 h, t=7.98, P<0.001). The incidence of radial artery occlusion (RAO) as an approach-related adverse event was 15.4% (6/39) in the TRA-HAIC group, which was significantly higher than that in the TFA-HAIC group (15.4% vs. 0, χ(2)=8.56, P=0.005). Notably, multifactorial analysis of RAO-related factors showed that intraoperative enoxaparin use and patency of radial artery flow during pressure were significantly associated with a reduced risk of postoperative RAO (P=0.037 for enoxaparin use and P=0.049 for pressure). Conclusions: With respect to procedure approach, TRA was significantly better than TFA in terms of patient satisfaction and mean length of stay. Through further process optimization and prevention of adverse reactions, the incidence of adverse reactions can be maintained at a relatively low level, so that patients can benefit from TRA in future operations in terms of cost-effectiveness and medical efficiency.",2024,Feb,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,63,2,183-191,,10.3760/cma.j.cn112138-20230827-00087,38326045,#402,Lyu 2024,,,0
Treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism in patients under palliative care.,Debourdeau P; Sevestre MA; Bertoletti L; Mayeur D; Girard P; Scotté F; Sanchez O; Mahé I,"Many patients with cancer require palliative care at some stage and the vast majority of people followed in palliative care are cancer patients. Patients with cancer are at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and this is particularly true during the advanced palliative phase when mobility is limited or absent. Patients with cancer in palliative cancer are at higher bleeding risk compared to non-cancer patients. Decisions to treat VTE or withhold anticoagulation for these patients have proven to be difficult and depend largely on an individual clinician's judgment. For this reason, we have developed a consensus proposal for appropriate management of cancer-associated thromboembolism (CAT) in patients in palliative care, which is presented in this article. The proposal was informed by the recent scientific literature retrieved through a systematic literature review. In cancer patients in advanced palliative care, the benefit-risk ratio of anticoagulation seems unfavourable with a higher haemorrhagic risk than the benefit associated with prevention of CAT recurrence and, above all, in the absence of any benefit on quality of life. For this reason, we recommend that patients should be prescribed anticoagulants on a case-by-case basis. The choice of whether to treat, and with which type of treatment, should take into account anticipated life expectancy and patient preferences, as well as clinical factors such as the estimated bleeding risk, the type of VTE experienced and the time since the VTE event.",2024,Jan,Arch Cardiovasc Dis,117,1,94-100,,10.1016/j.acvd.2023.11.008,38072741,#510,Debourdeau 2024,,,0
Treatment patterns and outcomes among adults with immune thrombocytopenia receiving pharmaceutical second-line therapies: a retrospective cohort study using administrative claims data.,Liang Y; Rascati K; Barner JC; Lawson KA; Nair R,"OBJECTIVES: To describe and compare real-world treatment patterns and clinical outcomes among individuals with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) receiving second-line therapies (rituximab, romiplostim, or eltrombopag). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a large administrative claims database (January 2013-May 2020) among continuously enrolled patients ≥18 years prescribed second-line ITP therapies. The index date was the date of the first claim of the study medications. Treatment patterns and outcomes were measured during the 12-month follow-up period. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to balance covariates across treatment groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare treatment patterns and bleeding risk outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 695 patients were included (rituximab, N = 285; romiplostim, N = 212; eltrombopag, N = 198). After IPTW, all baseline covariates were balanced. Compared to eltrombopag, patients in the rituximab cohort were 57% more likely to receive other ITP therapies (systematic corticosteroids or third-line therapies) during the follow-up period (odds ratio [OR] = 1.571, p = .030). There was no significant difference in the odds of receiving a different second-line therapy or experiencing a bleeding-related episode among three groups (p > .050). Patients in the romiplostim cohort were 69% more likely to receive rescue therapy compared to those in the rituximab cohort (OR = 1.688, p = .025). CONCLUSION: Patients with ITP receiving rituximab were more likely to need other ITP therapies but did not experience higher risk of bleeding compared to those receiving eltrombopag or romiplostim. Benefits, risks, cost-effectiveness, and patient preference should all be considered in optimizing second-line therapy for ITP.",2024,Mar,Curr Med Res Opin,,,1-8,,10.1080/03007995.2024.2328653,38465414,#211,Liang 2024,,,0
Hormone Therapy: Testosterone Replacement Therapy.,Snow L,"Testosterone levels decrease as men age. When the testes fail to produce an adequate level of endogenous testosterone, men develop hypogonadism. Although the definition of a low testosterone level varies among guidelines, a serum total testosterone level of less than 300 to 350 ng/dL on two separate morning blood samples is considered a low level. To receive exogenous testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), patients should meet criteria for hypogonadism, which is defined as a low testosterone level and signs or symptoms of hypogonadism. Management discussions should be individualized to address patient needs and goals. Counseling before therapy should include shared decision-making regarding risks, benefits, and expectations. Numerous testosterone formulations are available, ranging from topical gels to intramuscular injections. The choice of formulation depends on factors such as cost and patient preference. Use of TRT is limited by contraindications, adverse effects, and a lack of long-term safety data. Patients receiving this therapy require close monitoring. For patients who wish to avoid use of exogenous hormones, are not candidates for TRT, or are unable to tolerate its adverse effects, several nonhormonal pharmacotherapies are available.",2023,Aug,FP Essent,531,,7-14,,,37603880,#998,Snow 2023,,,0
Self-administered stretching exercises are as effective as motor control exercises for people with chronic non-specific low back pain: a randomised trial.,Turci AM; Nogueira CG; Nogueira Carrer HC; Chaves TC,"QUESTION: In people with chronic non-specific low back pain, what is the effect of self-administered stretching exercises relative to motor control exercises on pain intensity, disability, fear avoidance, global perceived effect and flexibility? DESIGN: Randomised trial with concealed allocation, intention-to-treat analysis and blinding of assessors. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred people with chronic non-specific low back pain. INTERVENTIONS: The self-stretching exercise group performed 6 stretches in 40-minute sessions. The motor control exercise group performed trunk stabilising exercises in 40-minute sessions. Both groups performed weekly supervised sessions for 8 weeks with one or more home sessions/week. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were pain intensity (0 to 10 scale) and disability (Oswestry Disability Index). The secondary outcomes were the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, global perceived effect, and the fingertip-to-floor test. Measures were taken at baseline and at 8, 13 and 26 weeks. RESULTS: On the 0 to 10 scale, the between-group difference in pain intensity was negligible, with a mean difference of roughly 0 (95% CI -1 to 1) at each time point. Similarly, the between-group difference on the 100-point disability scale was negligible: MD -1 (95% CI -3 to 1) at week 8, MD 1 (95% CI -1 to 3) at week 13 and MD 0 (95% CI -1 to 2) at week 26. The two interventions also had similar effects on the secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: In people with chronic non-specific low back pain, self-stretching exercises had very similar effects to motor control exercises on pain intensity, disability, fear avoidance, global perceived effect and flexibility up to 18 weeks beyond the end of an 8-week program. Given the established effectiveness of motor control exercises, either intervention could be recommended to people with chronic low back pain. The choice of intervention might be directed by patient preference.

The aim of the study was to assess the intradialytic tolerance and length of dialysis recovery time (DRT) in these modalities. This is an exploratory, crossover study in maintenance HD patients with low comorbidity and no clinical indications for the use of high-efficiency HD, who were exposed to five intermittent dialyses in random order: high-flux hemodialysis (S-HD), expanded HD (HDx), pre-dilution HDF (PRE-HDF), mix-dilution HDF (MIX-HDF) and post-dilution HDF (POST-HDF). Twenty-four dialysis sessions of each method were included in the analysis. Dialysis parameters, including blood flow rate, dialysis fluid flow rate and temperature, and pharmacological treatment were constant. Average total convection volume for post-HDF, pre-HDF and mix-HDF were 25.6 (3.8), 61.5 (7.2) and 47.1 (11.4) L, respectively. During all therapies, patients were monitored for the similarity of their hydration statuses using bioimpedance spectroscopy, and for similar variability over time in systemic blood pressure and cardiac output, while peripheral resistance was monitored using impedance cardiography. The lowest frequency of all intradialytic adverse events were observed during HDx. Delayed DRT was the shortest during PRE-HDF. Patients were also more likely to report immediate recovery while receiving PRE-HDF. These differences did not reach statistical significance; however, the study results suggest that intradialytic tolerance and DRT may depend on the dialysis method used. This supports the need of taking into account patient preferences and quality of life while individualizing high-efficiency therapy in HD patients.",2024,Jan,J Clin Med,13,2,,,10.3390/jcm13020326,38256460,#492,Zakrzewska 2024,,,0
"""Shared decision-making"" for prostate cancer screening: Is it a marker of quality preventative healthcare?",Golijanin B; Bhatt V; Homer A; Malshy K; Ochsner A; Wales R; Khaleel S; Mega A; Pareek G; Hyams E,"BACKGROUND: ""Shared decision-making"" (SDM) is a cornerstone of prostate cancer (PCa) screening guidelines due to tradeoffs between clinical benefits and concerns for over-diagnosis and over-treatment. SDM requires effort by primary-care-providers (PCP) in an often busy clinical setting to understand patient preferences with the backdrop of patient risk factors. We hypothesized that SDM for PCa screening, given its prominence in guidelines and practical challenges, may be associated with quality preventative healthcare in terms of other appropriate cancer screening and encouragement of other preventative health behaviors. METHODS: From the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, 50-75 year old men who underwent PSA screening were assessed for their participation in SDM, PCa and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, and other preventative health behaviors, like vaccination, exercise, and smoking status. Adjusted odds ratio of likelihood of PSA testing as a function of SDM was calculated. Likelihoods of SDM and PSA testing as a function of preventative health behaviors were also calculated. RESULTS: Screening rates were 62 % for PCa and 88 % for CRC. Rates of SDM were 39.1 % in those with PSA screening, and 16.2 % in those without. Odds of PSA screening were higher when SDM was present (AOR = 2.68). History of colonoscopy was associated with higher odds of SDM (AOR = 1.16) and PSA testing (AOR = 1.94). Health behaviors, like regular exercise, were associated with increased odds of SDM (AOR = 1.14) and PSA testing (AOR = 1.28). History of flu vaccination (AOR = 1.29) and pneumonia vaccination (AOR = 1.19) were associated with higher odds of SDM. Those who received the flu vaccine were also more likely to have PSA testing (AOR = 1.36). Smoking was negatively associated with SDM (AOR = 0.86) and PSA testing (AOR = 0.93). Older age was associated with higher rates of PSA screening (AOR = 1.03, CI = 1.03-1.03). Black men were more likely than white men to have SDM (AOR = 1.6, CI = 1.59 - 1.6) and decreased odds of PSA testing (AOR = 0.94, CI = 0.94 - 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: SDM was associated with higher odds of PSA screening, CRC screening, and other appropriate preventative health behaviors. Racial disparities exist in both SDM and PSA screening usage. SDM may be a trackable metric that can lead to wider preference-sensitive care and improved preventative care.",2024,Feb,Cancer Epidemiol,88,,102492,,10.1016/j.canep.2023.102492,38056246,#419,Golijanin 2024,,,0

Preferences of Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease for Invasive Versus Conservative Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,Wilson TA; Hazlewood GS; Sajobi TT; Wilton SB; Pearson WE; Connolly C; Javaheri PA; Finlay JL; Levin A; Graham MM; Tonelli M; James MT,"Background Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can experience acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with high morbidity and mortality. Early invasive management of ACS is recommended for most high-risk patients; however, choosing between an early invasive versus conservative management approach may be influenced by the unique risk of kidney failure for patients with CKD. Methods and Results This discrete choice experiment measured the preferences of patients with CKD for future cardiovascular events versus acute kidney injury and kidney failure following invasive heart procedures for ACS. The discrete choice experiment, consisting of 8 choice tasks, was administered to adult patients attending 2 CKD clinics in Calgary, Alberta. The part-worth utilities of each attribute were determined using multinomial logit models, and preference heterogeneity was explored using latent class analysis. A total of 140 patients completed the discrete choice experiment. The mean age of patients was 64 years, 52% were male, and mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 37 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). Across the range of levels, risk of mortality was the most important attribute, followed by risk of end-stage kidney disease and risk of recurrent myocardial infarction. Latent class analysis identified 2 distinct preference groups. The largest group included 115 (83%) patients, who placed the greatest value on treatment benefits and expressed the strongest preference for reducing mortality. A second group of 25 (17%) patients was identified who were procedure averse and had a strong preference toward conservative management of ACS and avoiding acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. Conclusions The preferences of most patients with CKD for management of ACS were most influenced by lowering mortality. However, a distinct subgroup of patients was strongly averse to invasive management. This highlights the importance of clarifying patient preferences to ensure treatment decisions are aligned with patient values.",2023,Mar,J Am Heart Assoc,12,6,e028492,,10.1161/JAHA.122.028492,36892063,#1405,Wilson 2023,,,1
QALY-type preference and willingness-to-pay among end-of-life patients with cancer treatments: a pilot study using discrete choice experiment.,Yin Y; Peng Q; Ma L; Dong Y; Sun Y; Xu S; Ding N; Liu X; Zhao M; Tang Y; Mei Z; Shao H; Yan D; Tang W,"PURPOSE: Quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a dominant measurement of health gain in economic evaluations for pricing drugs. However, end-of-life (EoL) patients' preference for QALY gains in life expectancy (LE) and quality of life (QoL) during different disease stages remains unknown and is seldom involved in decision-making. This study aims to measure preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) towards different types of QALY gain among EoL cancer patients. METHODS: We attributed QALY gain to four types, gain in LE and QoL, respectively, and during both progression-free survival (PFS) and post-progression survival (PPS). A discrete choice experiment including five attributes (the four QALY attributes and one cost attribute) with three levels each was developed and conducted with 85 Chinese advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients in 2022. All levels were set with QALY gain/cost synthesised from research on anti-lung cancer drugs recently listed by Chinese National Healthcare Security Administration. Each respondent answered six choice tasks in a face-to-face interview. The data were analysed using mixed logit models. RESULTS: Patients valued LE-related QALY gain in PFS most, with a relative importance of 81.8% and a WTP of $43,160 [95% CI 26,751 ~ 59,569] per QALY gain. Respondents consistently preferred LE-related to QoL-related QALY gain regardless of disease stage. Patients with higher income or lower education levels tended to pay more for QoL-related QALY gain. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a prioritised resource allocation to EoL-prolonging health technologies. Given the small sample size and large individual heterogeneity, a full-scale study is needed to provide more robust results.",2024,Mar,Qual Life Res,33,3,753-765,,10.1007/s11136-023-03562-3,38079024,#306,Yin 2024,,,1
Current status and prospect for future advancements of long-acting antibody formulations.,Tyagi P; Harper G; McGeehan P; Davis SP,"INTRODUCTION: Biologics, especially monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), have become a major class of therapeutics in recent years addressing the needs of millions of patients and becoming one of the best-selling treatments in the pharmaceutical market. A wide range of multifaceted chronic diseases have benefitted from antibody therapeutics. Long-term treatment for chronic diseases with mAb therapies can mean a lifetime of frequent injections. Technologies that can minimize the total number of injections present meaningful value to patients and the companies that develop them. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the challenges encountered during the development of long-acting versions of mAbs. The focus will be on questions addressed during drug product development, delivery device selection, business implications, and understanding the market potential of long-acting presentations. EXPERT OPINION: Long-acting drug delivery systems have reached the market for small molecules and peptides. However, these drug delivery systems, and their development lessons, cannot be extrapolated directly to antibodies. We must develop new delivery technologies suitable for biologics, identify critical attributes to capture dynamic changes in proteins during the encapsulation process, and develop analytical processes to evaluate long-term stability.",2023,Jul-Dec,Expert Opin Drug Deliv,20,7,895-903,,10.1080/17425247.2023.2219445,37249542,#1104,Tyagi 2023,,,0
MK-0616: an oral PCSK9 inhibitor for hypercholesterolemia treatment.,Burnett JR; Hooper AJ,"INTRODUCTION: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lowering LDL-cholesterol, by lifestyle modification or therapeutically, reduces the risk of ASCVD. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a protein which binds to the LDL-receptor and induces degradation, is a clinically validated target to lower LDL-cholesterol. Injectable PCSK9 inhibitor therapies have demonstrated substantial reductions in LDL-cholesterol with associated decreased risk of ASCVD events. AREAS COVERED: MK-0616 is an orally bioavailable, renally excreted, macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of PCSK9. The article provides an understanding of the chemistry and development, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of MK-0616 and insight into its clinical efficacy and safety. In clinical trials, MK-0616 produced dose-dependent reductions in LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein (apo) B levels. Furthermore, MK-0616 modestly lowered lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)]. EXPERT OPINION: MK-0616 is a potent, oral macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of PCSK9 that is not only able to reduce LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol, and apoB, but can also lower Lp(a). Safety and tolerability studies reported to date are promising. MK-0616 may offer advantages over injectable anti-PCSK9 therapies in terms of ease of dosing, patient preference and cost. The results from phase III trials of MK-0616 on cardiovascular outcomes are awaited with interest.",2023,Jul-Dec,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,32,10,873-878,,10.1080/13543784.2023.2267972,37815341,#1083,Burnett 2023,,,0
Intra-gastric balloon with lifestyle modification: a promising therapeutic option for overweight and obese patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,van Dijk AM; de Vries M; El-Morabit F; Bac ST; Mundt MW; van der Schuit LE; Hirdes MMC; Kara M; de Bruijne J; van Meer S; Kaasjager HAH; de Valk HW; Vleggaar FP; van Erpecum KJ,"BACKGROUND: Data on effects of intra-gastric balloon (IGB) on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) are scarce, in part with contradictory results, and mainly obtained in tertiary care patients with diabetes and other comorbidities. We here explore effects of IGB in patients with MASLD referred to a first-line obesity clinic. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, patients with at least significant fibrosis (≥ F2) and/or severe steatosis (S3) according to screening transient elastography (FibroScan®) were offered a second FibroScan® after 6 months lifestyle modification with or without IGB (based on patient preference). RESULTS: 50 of 100 consecutively screened patients (generally non-diabetic) qualified for repeated evaluation and 29 (58%) of those had a second FibroScan®. At baseline, at least significant fibrosis was present in 28% and severe steatosis in 91%. IGB was placed in 19 patients (59%), whereas 10 patients (41%) preferred only lifestyle modification (no differences in baseline characteristics between both groups). After 6 months, liver stiffness decreased markedly in the IGB group (median: from 6.0 to 4.9 kPa, p = 0.005), but not in the lifestyle modification only group (median: from 5.5 to 6.9 kPa, p = 0.477). Steatosis improved in both groups, (controlled attenuation parameter values; IGB, mean ± SD: from 328 ± 34 to 272 ± 62 dB/m, p = 0.006: lifestyle modification only, mean ± SD: from 344 ± 33 to 305 ± 43 dB/m: p = 0.006).

Patient Preferences for Postmastectomy Breast Reconstruction.,Shammas RL; Hung A; Mullikin A; Sergesketter AR; Lee CN; Reed SD; Fish LJ; Greenup RA; Hollenbeck ST,"IMPORTANCE: Up to 40% of women experience dissatisfaction after breast reconstruction due to unexpected outcomes that are poorly aligned with personal preferences. Identifying what attributes patients value when considering surgery could improve shared decision-making. Adaptive choice-based conjoint (ACBC) analysis can elicit individual-level treatment preferences. OBJECTIVES: To identify which attributes of breast reconstruction are most important to women considering surgery and to describe how these attributes differ by those who prefer flap vs implant reconstruction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from March 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023, at Duke University and between June 1 and December 31, 2022, through the Love Research Army with ACBC analysis. Participants were 105 women at Duke University with a new diagnosis of or genetic predisposition to breast cancer who were considering mastectomy with reconstruction and 301 women with a history of breast cancer or a genetic predisposition as identified through the Love Research Army registry. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Relative importance scores, part-worth utility values, and maximum acceptable risks were estimated. RESULTS: Overall, 406 women (105 from Duke University [mean (SD) age, 46.3 (10.5) years] and 301 from the Love Research Army registry [mean (SD) age, 59.2 (11.9) years]) participated. The attribute considered most important was the risk of abdominal morbidity (mean [SD] relative importance [RI], 28% [11%]), followed by chance of major complications (RI, 25% [10%]), number of additional operations (RI, 23% [12%]), appearance of the breasts (RI, 13% [12%]), and recovery time (RI, 11% [7%]). Most participants (344 [85%]) preferred implant-based reconstruction; these participants cared most about abdominal morbidity (mean [SD] RI, 30% [11%]), followed by the risk of complications (mean [SD], RI, 26% [11%]) and additional operations (mean [SD] RI, 21% [12%]). In contrast, participants who preferred flap reconstruction cared most about additional operations (mean [SD] RI, 31% [15%]), appearance of the breasts (mean [SD] RI, 27% [16%]), and risk of complications (mean [SD] RI, 18% [6%]). Factors independently associated with choosing flap reconstruction included being married (odds ratio [OR], 2.30 [95% CI, 1.04-5.08]; P = .04) and higher educational level (college education; OR, 2.43 [95% CI, 1.01-5.86]; P = .048), while having an income level of greater than $75 000 was associated with a decreased likelihood of choosing the flap profile (OR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.21-0.97]; P = .01). Respondents who preferred flap appearance were willing to accept a mean (SD) increase of 14.9% (2.2%) chance of abdominal morbidity (n = 113) or 6.4% (4.8%) chance of complications (n = 115). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides information on how women value different aspects of their care when making decisions for breast reconstruction. Future studies should assess how decision aids that elicit individual-level preferences can help tailor patient-physician discussions to focus preoperative counseling on factors that matter most to each patient and ultimately improve patient-centered care.",2023,Dec,JAMA Surg,158,12,1285-1292,,10.1001/jamasurg.2023.4432,37755818,#619,Shammas 2023,Martina Di Blasio  (2024-08-12 20:23:19)(Select): accesso padova; ,,1
Pharmacists' perspectives on recommending herbal medicines for acute infections: a qualitative study.,Hu XY; Logue M; Maund E; Santer M; Willcox ML; Islam S; Stokes T; Moore M,"BACKGROUND: Community pharmacists have an essential role in antimicrobial stewardship by providing self-care advice for self-limiting infections. AIM: To explore community pharmacists' perceptions and experiences of advising patients on management of acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and urinary tract infections (UTIs), and to explore issues regarding use of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, including herbal medicines. DESIGN & SETTING: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with community pharmacists in England. METHOD: Qualitative interviews with community pharmacists were carried out face to face and by telephone between November 2019 and March 2020. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews, recorded and transcribed. A reflexive thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: In total, 18 community pharmacists were interviewed. Three main themes were identified. Theme 1 was self-management recommendations. Community pharmacists considered patients' preferences when recommending self-management strategies. Some believed that conventional OTC medications had quicker and stronger effects, while others preferred herbal OTCs as a more natural approach, particularly for less severe symptoms. Theme 2 was factors influencing pharmacists' recommendations for acute infections. This included pharmacists' perceptions of patient preferences, nature or severity of illness, research evidence, training, commercial pressures, and patient concerns about medication cost. Theme 3 was pharmacist-patient communication. Pharmacists sometimes experienced challenges with language barriers and patients' expectations of receiving antibiotics. Pharmacists emphasised the importance of being trusted by their patients. There was widespread acceptance of their role in self-management advice for acute illness and interest in the role of herbal medicines, but pharmacists did not feel confident in recommending these. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists are central to the management of self-limiting infections. There is a need to educate the public about appropriate use of antibiotics and provide training and support for pharmacists on self-management strategies including herbal medicine.",2024,Mar,BJGP Open,,,,,10.3399/BJGPO.2023.0138,38086709,#229,Hu 2024,,,0
"Immunotherapy, Chemotherapy, or Both: Options for First-Line Therapy for Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.",Ho AL,"The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice.The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the management of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). The landmark KEYNOTE-048 clinical trial established the programmed death-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab with and without chemotherapy as a new standard first-line treatment for patients with platinum-sensitive R/M HNSCC. Nonetheless, clinical decision making can be challenging when considering the significant morbidity associated with rapidly progressive disease in high-risk locations, patient fitness, and programmed death-ligand 1 expression. Both planned and unplanned subgroup analyses from KEYNOTE-048 provide valuable insights into how therapy for untreated R/M HNSCC may be optimized for individual patients. Given differences in the toxicity profile of pembrolizumab alone versus in combination with chemotherapy, prioritizing patient preference is paramount in this palliative treatment setting. Here, the case of a patient presenting with de novo metastatic HNSCC is discussed to highlight the practical application of KEYNOTE-048 data in clinical practice.",2023,Feb,J Clin Oncol,41,4,736-741,,10.1200/JCO.22.01408,36223554,#1565,Ho 2023,,,0
Studying How Patient Engagement Influences Research: A Mixed Methods Study.,Marshall DA; Suryaprakash N; Lavallee DC; McCarron TL; Zelinsky S; Barker KL; MacKean G; Santana MJ; Moayyedi P; Bryan S,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence supporting the value of patient engagement (PE) in research to patients and researchers. However, there is little research evidence on the influence of PE throughout the entire research process as well as the outcomes of research engagement. The purpose of our study is to add to this evidence. METHODS: We used a convergent mixed method design to guide the integration of our survey data and observation data to assess the influence of PE in two groups, comprising patient research partners (PRPs), clinicians, and researchers. A PRP led one group (PLG) and an academic researcher led the other (RLG). Both groups were given the same research question and tasked to design and conduct an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related patient preference study. We administered validated evaluation tools at three points and observed PE in the two groups conducting the IBD study. RESULTS: PRPs in both groups took on many operational roles and influenced all stages of the IBD-related qualitative study: launch, design, implementation, and knowledge translation. PRPs provided more clarity on the study design, target population, inclusion-exclusion criteria, data collection approach, and the results. PRPs helped operationalize the project question, develop study material and data collection instruments, collect data, and present the data in a relevant and understandable manner to the patient community. The synergy of collaborative partnership resulted in two projects that were patient-centered, meaningful, understandable, legitimate, rigorous, adaptable, feasible, ethical and transparent, timely, and sustainable.

Perinatal mental health and COVID-19: Navigating a way forward.,Smith KA; Howard LM; Vigod SN; D'Agostino A; Cipriani A,"The COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath have increased pre-existing inequalities and risk factors for mental disorders in general, but perinatal mental disorders are of particular concern. They are already underdiagnosed and undertreated, and this has been magnified by the pandemic. Access to services (both psychiatric and obstetric) has been reduced, and in-person contact has been restricted because of the increased risks. Rates of perinatal anxiety and depressive symptoms have increased. In the face of these challenges, clear guidance in perinatal mental health is needed for patients and clinicians. However, a systematic search of the available resources showed only a small amount of guidance from a few countries, with a focus on the acute phase of the pandemic rather than the challenges of new variants and variable rates of infection. Telepsychiatry offers advantages during times of restricted social contact and also as an additional route for accessing a wide range of digital technologies. While there is a strong evidence base for general telepsychiatry, the particular issues in perinatal mental health need further examination. Clinicians will need expertise and training to navigate a hybrid model, flexibly combining in person and remote assessments according to risk, clinical need and individual patient preferences. There are also wider issues of care planning in the context of varying infection rates, restrictions and vaccination access in different countries. Clinicians will need to focus on prevention, treatment, risk assessment and symptom monitoring, but there will also need to be an urgent and coordinated focus on guidance and planning across all organisations involved in perinatal mental health care.",2023,Jul,Aust N Z J Psychiatry,57,7,937-943,,10.1177/00048674221137819,36440619,#1138,Smith 2023,,,0
Survival Outcomes in Older Women with Oestrogen-Receptor-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Primary Endocrine Therapy vs. Surgery by Comorbidity and Frailty Levels.,Wang Y; Steinke D; Gavan SP; Chen TC; Carr MJ; Ashcroft DM; Cheung KL; Chen LC,"Primary endocrine therapy (PET) offers non-surgical treatment for older women with early-stage breast cancer who are unsuitable for surgery due to frailty or comorbidity. This research assessed all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality of PET vs. surgery in older women (≥70 years) with oestrogen-receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer by frailty and comorbidity levels. This study used UK secondary data to analyse older female patients from 2000 to 2016. Patients were censored until 31 May 2019 and grouped by the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and hospital frailty risk score (HFRS). Cox regression models compared all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality between PET and surgery within each group, adjusting for patient preferences and covariates. Sensitivity analyses accounted for competing risks. There were 23,109 patients included. The hazard ratio (HR) comparing PET to surgery for overall survival decreased significantly from 2.1 (95%CI: 2.0, 2.2) to 1.2 (95%CI: 1.1, 1.5) with increasing HFRS and from 2.1 (95%CI: 2.0, 2.2) to 1.4 (95%CI 1.2, 1.7) with rising CCI. However, there was no difference in BCSM for frail older women (HR: 1.2; 0.9, 1.9). There were no differences in competing risk profiles between other causes of death and breast cancer-specific mortality with PET versus surgery, with a subdistribution hazard ratio of 1.1 (0.9, 1.4) for high-level HFRS (p = 0.261) and CCI (p = 0.093). Given limited survival gains from surgery for older patients, PET shows potential as an effective option for frail older women with early-stage breast cancer. Despite surgery outperforming PET, surgery loses its edge as frailty increases, with negligible differences in the very frail.",2024,Feb,Cancers (Basel),16,4,,,10.3390/cancers16040749,38398140,#377,Wang 2024,,,0
Survival rates of systemic interventions for psoriasis in the Western Japan Psoriasis Registry: A multicenter retrospective study.,Yanase T; Tsuruta N; Yamaguchi K; Ohata C; Ohyama B; Katayama E; Sugita K; Kuwashiro M; Hashimoto A; Yonekura K; Higashi Y; Murota H; Koike Y; Matsuzaka Y; Kikuchi S; Hatano Y; Saito K; Takahashi K; Miyagi T; Kaneko S; Ota M; Harada K; Morizane S; Ikeda K; Furue M; Nakahara T; Okazaki F; Sasaki N; Okada E; Yoshida Y; Ito K; Imafuku S,"Psoriasis affects approximately 0.3% of the Japanese population. Recently, various effective systemic drugs have become available, and the continuation of a given treatment has become critical because of the chronic nature of psoriasis. Factors affecting drug survival (the time until treatment discontinuation) in psoriasis treatment include efficacy, safety, ease of use, and patient preference. In the present study, the authors retrospectively surveyed a multifacility patient registry to determine the real-world evidence of the survival rate of systemic interventions for psoriasis treatment. Patients with psoriasis who visited 20 facilities in the Western Japan area between January 2019 and May 2020 and gave written consent were registered as study participants, and their medical history of systemic interventions for psoriasis (starting from 2010) was retrospectively collected and analyzed. The drugs investigated were adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, risankizumab, cyclosporine, and apremilast. When drugs were discontinued, the reasons were also recorded. A total of 1003 patients with psoriasis including 268 with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) were enrolled. In biologics, more recently released drugs such as interleukin 17 inhibitors showed a numerically higher survival rate in the overall (post-2010) analysis. However, in the subset of patients who began treatment after 2017, the difference in the survival rate among the drugs was smaller. The reasons for discontinuing drugs varied, but a loss of efficacy against dermatological or joint symptoms were relatively frequently seen with some biologics and cyclosporine. The stratification of drug survival rates based on patient characteristics such as bio-naive or experienced, normal weight or obese, and with or without PsA, revealed that bio-experienced, obese, and PsA groups had poorer survival rates for most drugs. No notable safety issues were identified in this study. Overall, the present study revealed that the biologics show differences in their tendency to develop a loss of efficacy, and the factors that negatively impact the survival rate of biologics include the previous use of biologics, obesity, and PsA.",2023,Jun,J Dermatol,50,6,753-765,,10.1111/1346-8138.16737,36786158,#1207,Yanase 2023,,,0
Primary prevention of cancer-associated venous thrombosis: Rationale and challenges in clinical practice.,Elalamy I; Cohen-Solal A; Hanon O; Mirabel M; Mismetti P; Spano JP,"Cancer-associated venous thrombosis (CAT) is a common, multifactor event known to complicate the course of cancer and jeopardize a patient's prognosis. The current guidelines regarding the prevention of CAT are sometimes considered insufficiently precise about specific situations, or are poorly applied. The expected benefits of thromboprophylaxis are balanced by the risk of major bleeding induced by anticoagulation, which implies a need to accurately identify ambulatory patients at high risk of thrombosis or hemorrhage. The Khorana score is commonly used for this, but is limited by the non-reproducibility of predicted performance across cancer types, and by the fact that antitumor treatment and cardiovascular risks are not included. The COMPASS-CAT score, which includes those two aspects, was found to be a more accurate predictor of venous thromboembolism in patients with lung cancer, and to better distinguish between patients at low or high risk of thrombosis. The frailty of patients with cancer is also a major issue, and should be taken into account when thromboprophylaxis is considered. According to current guidelines, CAT prophylaxis should be considered for hospitalized patients, those for whom surgery is scheduled, or those with pancreatic cancers. In ambulatory patients, decisions should be made according to patient, cancer and antitumoral treatment characteristics. Low molecular weight heparin is the gold standard of CAT prophylaxis. Despite increased risks of bleeding or drug-drug interactions in cancer patients, direct oral anticoagulants could be alternate options for high-risk ambulatory patients that should be accompanied by a careful global analysis of benefits, harms, and patient preferences.",2023,Jul-Sep,Curr Res Transl Med,71,3,103405,,10.1016/j.retram.2023.103405,37478777,#1091,Elalamy 2023,,,0
"Factors associated to patients' referral to public or private Covid-19 healthcare centers in Tabriz, Iran.",Jafari N; Akbari H; Sarbakhsh P; Dorosti A; Khayatzadeh S; Mohammadpoorasl A,"BACKGROUND: In Iran, tracking of patients and its associated data recording in private healthcare centers are poor, and thus a majority of patients suffering from Covid-19 are treated without any control on the isolation and quarantine processes. The present study aims to investigate the factors contributed to referral to private or public healthcare centers that provide Covid-19 care services. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2021 to January 2022 in Tabriz, Iran. We invited a total of 258 and 202Covid-19 patients from governmental and private healthcare centers, respectively, to participate in the study by convenient sampling method. Applying a self-administered questionnaire, we collected data on the reason of referring to the healthcare centers, patient's waiting time, quality of healthcare services received by the patients, patients' level of satisfaction, accessibility, insurance coverage, perceived severity of the disease, and the level of staff compliance from health protocols. Logistic regression model was used for data analysis by using SPSS-26 software. RESULTS: Adjusted for other variables, higher socio-economic status (AOR (Adjusted Odds Ratio) = 6.64), older age (AOR = 1.02), referral of friends and family members (AOR = 1.52), shorter waiting time (AOR = 1.02) and higher satisfaction (AOR = 1.02) were contributed to referral to private centers. Better accessibility (AOR = 0.98) and wider insurance coverage (AOR = 0.99) were also contributed to referral to governmental centers. CONCLUSION: Providing more appropriate insurance coverage by private healthcare centers, and promoting their level of accessibility seems to promote patients' referral to such centers. Moreover, establishing an accurate system for recording patients' information and follow up in private centers might promote the role of private healthcare centers in managing the overload of patients on healthcare system during such epidemics.",2023,Jun,BMC Health Serv Res,23,1,620,,10.1186/s12913-023-09640-z,37312132,#1164,Jafari 2023,,,0
A Narrative Synthesis of Literature on the Barriers to Timely Diagnosis and Treatment of Cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa.,Mwamba M; Lombe DC; Msadabwe S; Bond V; Simwinga M; Sentoogo Ssemata A; Muhumuza R; Seeley J; Mwaka AD; Aggarwal A,"Poor cancer survival outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have been linked to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Here we present a detailed overview of the qualitative literature evaluating the barriers to receiving timely diagnosis and treatment of cancer in SSA. The PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO databases were searched to identify qualitative studies reporting on barriers to timely diagnosis of cancer in SSA published between 1995 and 2020. A systematic review methodology was applied, including quality assessment and narrative data synthesis. We identified 39 studies, of which 24 focused on breast or cervical cancer. Only one study focused on prostate cancer and one on lung cancer. When exploring factors contributing to delays, six key themes emerged from the data. The first theme was health service barriers, which included: (i) inadequate numbers of trained specialists; (ii) limited knowledge of cancer among healthcare providers; (iii) poor co-ordination of care; (iv) inadequately resourced health facilities; (v) negative attitudes of healthcare providers towards patients; (vi) high cost of diagnostic and treatment services. The second key theme was patient preference for complementary and alternative medicine; the third was the limited understanding of cancer among the population. The fourth barrier was a patient's personal and family obligations; the fifth was the perceived impact of cancer and its treatment on sexuality, body image and relationships. Finally, the sixth was the stigma and discrimination faced by patients following a diagnosis of cancer. In conclusion, health system, patient level and societal factors all influence the likelihood of timely diagnosis and treatment for cancer in SSA. The results provide a focus for targeting health system interventions, particular with regards to awareness and understanding of cancer in the region.",2023,Sep,Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol),35,9,e537-e548,,10.1016/j.clon.2023.05.011,37302880,#932,Mwamba 2023,,,0
Nursing leadership to facilitate patient participation in fundamental care: An ethnographic qualitative study.,Bahlman-van Ooijen W; van Belle E; Bank A; de Man-Van Ginkel J; Huisman-de Waal G; Heinen M,"AIMS: To explore and describe hospital nurses' perceptions of leadership behaviours in facilitating patient participation in fundamental care. DESIGN: An ethnographic interview study. METHODS: Individual semi-structured interviews with 12 nurses with a bachelor's or master's degree working at a university medical centre were conducted between February and April 2021. The interview data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Six themes were derived from the data: (1) nursing leadership; (2) patient participation; (3) using patients' preferences; (4) building relationships; (5) task-focused nursing; (6) need for role modelling. CONCLUSION: Nurses indicated leadership behaviour to facilitate patient participation in fundamental care as inviting patients to participate and eliciting and supporting patients' preferences. Although nurses also regarded leadership as motivating colleagues to act and enhancing evidence-based practice, they appeared not to practise this themselves about patient participation. Role modelling was indicated as a need for improvement. IMPACT: The findings established that not all leadership behaviours mentioned were used in practice about patient participation in fundamental care. Role modelling and the use of evidence-based practice are needed to increase patient participation. Further research will be necessary to develop and test leadership interventions to improve patient participation in fundamental care.",2023,Mar,J Adv Nurs,79,3,1044-1055,,10.1111/jan.15329,35748056,#1495,Bahlman-vanOoijen 2023,,,0
Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Absorbable and Nonabsorbable Sutures in A1 Pulley Release.,Kim YB; Choi YS; Yoon TH; Lee HD,"BACKGROUND: Both absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures are used to correct palmar incisions or lacerations. Nonabsorbable sutures have been used without complications but require removal at a follow-up appointment. Alternatively, the use of absorbable sutures has increased in popularity as postoperative suture removal is not required but is associated with local immunological and inflammatory responses. In this study, we compared the scar quality and outcomes of nonabsorbable and absorbable sutures in A1 pulley release. METHODS: Patients who underwent A1 pulley release were randomized to 1 of 2 suture materials. The Patient Scar Assessment Scale, Observer Scar Assessment Scale, Visual Analogue Scale, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores were collected at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Among the 41 patients included in the study, 23 were randomized to the nonabsorbable suture group, and 18 to the absorbable suture group. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two suture groups in the aforementioned assessments. Complication rates were higher in the nonabsorbable suture group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Notably, 1 case in the absorbable suture group had uncontrolled postoperative bleeding and required reoperation. CONCLUSION: We found no significant difference between the two materials in terms of the Patient or Observer Scar Assessment Scales, overall complication rates, symptom scores, or pain scores. Therefore, the choice using absorbable or nonabsorbable can be guided by other factors such as physician or patient preference, availability, and cost.",2023,Nov,Hand (N Y),,,15589447231210332,,10.1177/15589447231210332,37997760,#661,Kim 2023,,,0
Prevalence and Correlates of Preference-Concordant Care Among Hospitalized People Receiving Maintenance Dialysis.,Kazi BS; Duberstein PR; Kluger BM; Epstein RM; Fiscella KA; Kazi ZS; Dahl SK; Allen RJ; Saeed F,"KEY POINTS: A large proportion of hospitalized patients receiving dialysis report not receiving preference-concordant care. Hospitalized patients on dialysis desiring a comfort-oriented medical plan were likely to report receiving preference-concordant care. BACKGROUND: Preference-concordant care is a cornerstone of high-quality medical decision-making, yet the prevalence and correlates of preference-concordant care have not been well-studied in patients receiving dialysis. We surveyed hospitalized people receiving maintenance dialysis to estimate the prevalence and correlates of preference-concordant care among this population. METHODS: We assessed preference concordance by asking participants (223/380, 59% response rate), “How strongly do you agree or disagree that your current treatment plan meets your preference?” We assessed treatment plan preference by asking whether patients preferred a plan that focused on (1) extending life or (2) relieving pain and discomfort. We assessed shared dialysis decision-making using the 9-item Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire. We examined the differences between those reporting lack of preference-concordant care and those reporting receipt of preference-concordant care using chi-squared analyses. We also studied whether patients' treatment plan preferences or shared dialysis decision-making scores were correlated with their likelihood of receiving preference-concordant care. RESULTS: Of the 213 respondents who provided data on preference concordance, 90 (42.3%) reported that they were not receiving preference-concordant care. Patients who preferred pain and discomfort relief over life extension were less likely (odds ratio, 0.15 [95% confidence interval, 0.08 to 0.28] P = <0.0001) to report receiving preference-concordant care; patients with higher shared decision-making scores were more likely (odds ratio, 1.02 [95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.03], P = 0.02) to report preference-concordant care. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of this sample of hospitalized people receiving maintenance dialysis reported not receiving preference-concordant care. Efforts to improve symptom management and enhance patient engagement in dialysis decision-making may improve the patients' perceptions of receiving preference-concordant care.",2023,Jun,Kidney360,4,6,e751-e758,,10.34067/KID.0000000000000131,37143194,#1195,Kazi 2023,,,0
"Prevalence of Hemorrhoids and Their Risk Factors Among the Adult Population in Jazan, Saudi Arabia.",Oberi IA; Omar Y; Alfaifi AJ; Ayoub RA; Ajeebi Y; Moafa SH; Elhilu AH; Ayoub AH; Gosadi IM,"BACKGROUND: Hemorrhoids are defined as the symptomatic enlargement and distal displacement of the normal anal cushions. They can be either internal, external, or internoexternal, according to their position in relation to the dentate line. They can cause significant financial burdens and personal discomfort. However, the typical symptoms of hemorrhoids include bleeding, pain, skin irritation, fecal leakage, prolapse, mucus secretion, and developing a thrombosed hernia. Nonetheless, research has shown that individuals with and without hemorrhoids equally report these symptoms. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of hemorrhoids and their risk factors among adult subjects in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This investigation was a cross-sectional study targeting adults diagnosed with hemorrhoids in the Jazan region. Data collection was performed via a self-administered questionnaire to measure sociodemographic data of the participants, lifestyle factors associated with hemorrhoids, clinical presentations of the disease, and Rome IV criteria for diagnosis of functional constipation. The chi-squared test was used to assess the frequency of hemorrhoid symptoms according to the participants' sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. RESULTS: In the current study, which recruited 361 participants, 59% (216 individuals) reported experiencing at least one symptom of hemorrhoids. The majority of the sample were females (60%), Saudis (96%), and living in urban areas (59%) and had a university education (77.3%). The most common risk factors identified were lack of regular physical activity (83%), prolonged sitting during office work (51%), and consuming food with saturated fat (50%). A total of 44% (159 participants) had a family history of hemorrhoids, and 40% reported suffering from constipation three times or more per week. Only 34% (123 participants) had been diagnosed with hemorrhoids by a physician. Interestingly, the majority of participants (57%) preferred using home remedies instead of seeking medical care from a healthcare professional. When assessing factors associated with experiencing a minimum of six hemorrhoid symptoms per month, age, lifestyle factors, family history of hemorrhoids, and defecation practices were found to be significantly correlated with a higher occurrence of symptoms (with a p-value of less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: The current study identified a high prevalence of hemorrhoid symptoms and their risk factors among the adult population in the Jazan region of Saudi Arabia. The findings suggest a need to increase the awareness of the public about hemorrhoids risk factors and the importance of seeking healthcare at an early stage of the disease.",2023,Sep,Cureus,15,9,e45919,,10.7759/cureus.45919,37885500,#859,Oberi 2023,,,0
Exercise Therapy for Knee and Hip Osteoarthritis: Is There An Ideal Prescription?,Young JJ; Pedersen JR; Bricca A,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Exercise therapy is the first line treatment for patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) but is consistently underutilized. In this review, we aim to provide health care professionals with an overview of the latest evidence in the areas of exercise therapy for OA, which can serve as a guide for incorporating the ideal exercise therapy prescription in the overall management plan for their patients with OA. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence continues to be produced supporting the use of exercise therapy for all patients with knee or hip OA. Ample evidence exists suggesting exercise therapy is a safe form of treatment, for both joint structures and the patient overall. Several systematic reviews show that exercise therapy is likely to improve patient outcomes, regardless of disease severity or comorbidities. However, no single type of exercise therapy is superior to others. SUMMARY: Health care practitioners and patients should be encouraged to incorporate exercise therapy into treatment plans and can be assured of the safety profile and likelihood of improvement in important patient outcomes. Since no single exercise therapy program shows vastly superior benefit, patient preference and contextual factors should be central to the shared decision-making process when selecting and individualising appropriate exercise therapy prescriptions.",2023,May,Curr Treatm Opt Rheumatol,,,1-17,,10.1007/s40674-023-00205-z,37362069,#1229,Young 2023,,,0
Insomnia and related mental health conditions: Essential neurobiological underpinnings towards reduced polypharmacy utilization rates.,Fornaro M; Caiazza C; De Simone G; Rossano F; de Bartolomeis A,"Insomnia represents a significant public health burden, with a 10% prevalence in the general population. Reduced sleep affects social and working functioning, productivity, and patient's quality of life, leading to a total of $100 billion per year in direct and indirect healthcare costs. Primary insomnia is unrelated to any other mental or medical illness; secondary insomnia co-occurs with other underlying medical, iatrogenic, or mental conditions. Epidemiological studies found a 40-50% comorbidity prevalence between insomnia and psychiatric disorders, suggesting a high relevance of mental health in insomniacs. Sleep disturbances also worsen the outcomes of several psychiatric disorders, leading to more severe psychopathology and incomplete remission, plausibly contributing to treatment-resistant conditions. Insomnia and psychiatric disorder coexistence can lead to polypharmacy, namely, the concurrent use of two or more medications in the same patient, regardless of their purpose or rationale. Polypharmacy increases the risk of using unnecessary drugs, the likelihood of drug interactions and adverse events, and reduces the patient's compliance due to regimen complexity. The workup of insomnia must consider the patient's sleep habits and inquire about any medical and mental concurrent conditions that must be handled to allow insomnia to be remitted adequately. Monotherapy or limited polypharmacy should be preferred, especially in case of multiple comorbidities, promoting multipurpose molecules with sedative properties and with bedtime administration. Also, non-pharmacological interventions for insomnia, such as sleep hygiene, relaxation training and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy may be useful in secondary insomnia to confront behaviors and thoughts contributing to insomnia and help optimizing the pharmacotherapy. However, insomnia therapy should always be patient-tailored, considering drug indications, contraindications, and pharmacokinetics, besides insomnia phenotype, clinical picture, patient preferences, and side effect profile.",2024,Jan,Sleep Med,113,,198-214,,10.1016/j.sleep.2023.11.033,38043331,#514,Fornaro 2024,,,0
Agreement and Reliability of Patient-measured Postvoid Residual Bladder Volumes.,Jalfon M; Gardezi M; Heckscher D; Shaheen D; Maciejewski KR; Li F; Rickey L; Foster H; Cavallo JA,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the reliability, agreement with provider measurement, and patient preferences regarding patient self-measurement of postvoid residual bladder volume (PVR). PVR measurement in the nonhealthcare setting is a valuable opportunity for remote monitoring of voiding dysfunction patients. We hypothesized that patient self-measurement of PVR using a smart-device portable ultrasound system with artificial intelligence would demonstrate high reliability, strong agreement with provider measurement, and be preferred over provider measurements. METHODS: Patients were enrolled during outpatient Urology visits. PVRs were measured in triplicate by providers using each of the following: an FDA-cleared (standard) bladder scanner, the portable ultrasound probe using ultrasound images (Butterfly US image mode), and the portable ultrasound probe using abstract images (Butterfly abstract mode). Subjects self-measured PVRs in triplicate using both imaging modes and reported their experiences via questionnaire. Reliability was assessed via intraclass correlation. Agreement between methods was assessed via Bland-Altman analyses using a clinically acceptable difference threshold of 50 mL. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled. Intraclass correlations ranged from 0.95 to 0.98 for each method. 95% limits of agreement between standard bladder scanner and patient self-measurement were - 71.73 mL and 86.73 mL using Butterfly US image mode and - 93.84 mL and 112.52 mL using Butterfly abstract mode, respectively. Most patients preferred self-measurement over provider measurement (74% vs 26%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Patient self-measurement of PVR using smart-device integrated portable ultrasound probes is feasible, reliable, and preferred by patients. Limits of agreement between patient self-measurement and standard bladder scanner measurements exceeded our clinically acceptable difference threshold, though the inherent error of ultrasound-based bladder volume measurements should be considered. Longitudinal PVR assessments in nonhealthcare settings may facilitate remote monitoring of voiding dysfunction patients.",2024,Feb,Urology,184,,62-68,,10.1016/j.urology.2023.11.026,38092325,#417,Jalfon 2024,,,0
Early safety and efficacy comparison of endoscopic bariatric interventions.,Gudur AR; Geng CX; Podboy A,"BACKGROUND: Intragastric balloon (IGB) placement and endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) are the 2 primary endoscopic bariatric therapies currently performed in the United States. Procedural selection is often based primarily on patient preference. There is a paucity of comparative data between these interventions. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to compare the short-term safety and efficacy of IGB to ESG in the largest, direct comparative analysis to date. SETTING: Accredited bariatric centers across the United States and Canada. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent IGB or ESG from 2016 to 2020 from the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program database. IGB patients were propensity matched (1:1) to ESG patients. We compared readmissions, reinterventions, serious adverse events (SAE), weight loss, procedure time, and length of stay between the 2 interventions. All outcomes were measured within 30 days of the initial procedure. RESULTS: A total of 1998 pairs of patients who underwent IGB and ESG were propensity matched with no difference in baseline characteristics. Patients who underwent ESG had more readmissions within 30 days. Patients who underwent IGB had more outpatient treatments for dehydration and re-interventions, with 3.7% of patients undergoing early balloon removal less than 30 days from implantation. Both procedures had similarly low rates of SAE (P > .05). ESG led to greater total body weight loss at 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: ESG and IGB are both safe procedures with comparably low rates of SAE. Higher rates of dehydration and re-interventions after IGB suggest that ESG is perhaps better tolerated.",2023,Oct,Surg Obes Relat Dis,19,10,1148-1153,,10.1016/j.soard.2023.03.018,37120354,#842,Gudur 2023,,,0
Comparison of a validated decision-support tool to a standard of care triage system for knee osteoarthritis assessment: a proof-of-concept study.,Wagar P; Chahal S; Siddiqui R; Littlefield S; Fanti C; Cullinan C; Droll K; Marion TE; Cooke TD; Puskas D,"BACKGROUND: Patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) in northwestern Ontario are referred by their primary care provider (PCP) to a centralized assessment clinic for evaluation by an advanced practice physiotherapist (APP) to determine if they will require surgical management. However, many patients are found to not require surgical management, resulting in delays for patients who do. A decision-support tool was developed to address this issue and to guide treatment options by determining the need for surgical or nonsurgical approaches. METHODS: We used a proof-of-concept method to assess the use of the decision-support tool in northwestern Ontario. Data from 100 consecutive patients assessed for knee OA management were collected from the Thunder Bay centralized assessment clinic. Two levels of agreement analyses (calculated using Cohen κ statistic) were performed, between the APP assessment decision (surgical or non-surgical) and the decision-support tool recommendation, and between the surgeon's decision (surgical or non-surgical) and the decision-support tool recommendation. RESULTS: We found a near-perfect agreement (κ = 0.870, n = 65) between the APP decision and the decision-support tool recommendation, when controlled for patient preference. There was a substantial level of agreement (κ = 0.618, n = 72) between the decision-support tool recommendation and the surgeon's decision. CONCLUSION: The decision-support tool recommendation showed considerable agreement with the decisions of the APP and surgeon indicating that it could be a valuable tool to guide PCPs caring for patients with knee OA. The applicability of a decision-support tool in northwestern Ontario displayed promising results, but further research is needed to examine the feasibility in a primary care setting.",2023,May-Jun,Can J Surg,66,3,E269-E273,,10.1503/cjs.012322,37169385,#1242,Wagar 2023,,,0
Gene Therapy for Hemophilia A: A Mixed Methods Study of Patient Preferences and Shared Decision-Making.,Limjoco J; Thornburg CD,"PURPOSE: As gene therapies for hemophilia are incorporated into clinical practice, shared decision-making (SDM) is recommended for implementation. SDM tools may facilitate informed decision-making for gene therapy and other novel therapies. OBJECTIVE: To inform the development of SDM tools for hemophilia gene therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Men with severe hemophilia were recruited from the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) Community Voices in Research (CVR). Semi-structured interviews were completed, and the interviews were transcribed verbatim for quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-five men with severe hemophilia A participated. All participants reported treatment with prophylaxis, nine (36%) on continuous prophylaxis with clotting factor, one (4%) on intermittent prophylaxis with clotting factor, and 15 (60%) on continuous prophylaxis with emicizumab. Ten (40%) indicated that they are excited about gene therapy, 12 (48%) indicated that they are hopeful about gene therapy, one (4%) indicated that they are worried or scared about gene therapy, and one (4%) indicated that they do not have strong feelings about gene therapy. Participants reported engaging Hemophilia Treatment Center, family, and the hemophilia community in their decision-making process. The most reported information needs are efficacy, safety, cost/insurance, mechanism of action, and follow-up. In addition, key information themes that emerged were patient testimonials, hard data and statistics, and comparison to other products. Twenty-two (88%) indicated that a SDM tool would be useful when discussing gene therapy with their hemophilia team. Two indicated that they do their own research, and the tool would not add anything. One needed more information to provide an answer. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the utility of a SDM tool for hemophilia gene therapy and key information needs. Data including comparison to other treatments should be provided along with patient testimonials in a transparent format.

"Assessing Medical Ethics Knowledge and Practice Among Healthcare Professionals in Al Majma'ah, Saudi Arabia.",Faraz A; Deyab AA; Alanzan A; Muwayni AM; Al Hodairy MS; Alharbi M; Alruwaili S,"Background The healthcare system is increasingly confronted with ethical challenges, necessitating a thorough exploration of healthcare providers' ethical knowledge and attitudes. This study aims to evaluate the ethical awareness and attitudes of healthcare providers in the Al Majma'ah region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Aim This research focuses on assessing the level of knowledge and practice regarding medical ethics among healthcare providers in a community hospital in Majmaah, KSA. Methods A comprehensive cross-sectional study was undertaken in the Majmaah governorate of Saudi Arabia. Data collection involved distributing a meticulously designed questionnaire to healthcare providers and faculty members affiliated with the College of Medicine. Subsequently, the acquired dataset underwent analysis utilizing SPSS software. Results A total of 183 participants were included in the study. The findings revealed that only 77 respondents (42.1%) considered ethical issues in their profession as extremely important. Moreover, 104 participants (56.8%) were aware of the existence of an ethics committee in their institution. A total of 113 respondents (61.7%) disagreed with the notion that ethical conduct is primarily important to avoid legal consequences, and 120 participants (65.6%) believed in the significance of in-service training on medical ethics for doctors. The study also highlighted that 100 participants (54.6%) believed that healthcare providers' opinions supersede patient preferences. However, a majority, 163 participants (89.1%), agreed that patients should be informed of any wrongdoing, contrasting with only 20 (10.9%) who disagreed. When asked about adhering to patients' wishes despite doctors' opinions, 112 (61.2%) responded affirmatively, while 71 (38.3%) disagreed. There was also a disparity in opinions regarding the necessity of obtaining consent, with 81 (44.3%) agreeing that consent is required not only for surgical procedures but also for medications or investigations. Furthermore, 137 participants (74.9%) recognized the importance of discussing ethical, social, and legal issues during clinical rounds alongside clinical aspects of patient care, while 46 (25.1%) disagreed. Conclusion Although medical ethics were introduced into the Saudi healthcare system more than a decade ago, this study underscores the ethical necessity of obtaining comprehensive informed consent prior to invasive and other medical procedures. It also highlights the significance of engaging patients in the decision-making process regarding their treatment. Well-informed patients typically exhibit higher satisfaction levels and are less inclined to pursue legal action.",2024,Feb,Cureus,16,2,e53676,,10.7759/cureus.53676,38455813,#390,Faraz 2024,,,0
National survey on management of spontaneous pneumothorax from emergency department to specialised treatment: room for improvement.,Skaarup SH; Laursen CB; Hallifax RJ; Iqbal B; Bødtger U,"INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) affects both young, otherwise healthy individuals and older persons with known underlying pulmonary disease. Initial management possibilities are evolving and range from observation to chest tube insertion. SP guidelines suggest an individualized approach based on multiple factors such as symptoms, size of pneumothorax, comorbidity and patient preference. AIM: With this Danish national survey we aimed to map organization of care including involved specialties, treatment choice, training, and follow-up plans to identify aspects, and optimization of spontaneous pneumothorax management. METHOD: A survey developed by the national interest group for pleural medicine was sent to all departments of emergency medicine, thoracic surgery, respiratory medicine, and to relevant departments of abdominal or orthopaedic surgery. RESULTS: The response rate was 75 % (47 of 65). Overall, 21% of responding departments had no guideline for SP management, which was provided by multiple specialties with marked heterogeneity in choice of treatment including tube size, management during admission, and referral procedure to follow-up. Few departments required procedure training, and nearly all of the responders called for improvements in management of pneumothorax. CONCLUSION: This survey suggests that SP management and care is delivered heterogeneously across Danish hospitals with marked difference between respiratory physicians, emergency physicians, general surgeons and thoracic surgeons. It is therefore likely that management is sub-optimal. There is a need for a common Danish SP guideline to ensure optimal treatment across involved specialties.",2024,,Eur Clin Respir J,11,1,2307648,,10.1080/20018525.2024.2307648,38304715,#441,Skaarup 2024,,,0
Preferences in medications for patients seeking treatment for opioid use disorder: A conjoint analysis.,Muthulingam D; Hassett TC; Madden LM; Bromberg DJ; Fraenkel L; Altice FL,"INTRODUCTION: The opioid epidemic continues to be a public health crisis that has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are the most effective way to reduce complications from opioid use disorder (OUD), but uptake is limited by both structural and individual factors. To inform strategies addressing individual factors, we evaluated patients' preferences and trade-offs in treatment decisions using conjoint analysis. METHOD: We developed a conjoint analysis survey evaluating patients' preferences for FDA-approved MOUDs. We recruited patients with OUD presenting to initiate treatment. This survey included five attributes: induction, location and route of administration, impact on mortality, side effects, and withdrawal symptoms with cessation. Participants performed 12 choice sets, each with two hypothetical profiles and a ""none"" option. We used Hierarchical Bayes to identify relative importance of each attribute and part-worth utility scores of levels, which we compared using chi-squared analysis. We used the STROBE checklist to guide our reporting of this cross-sectional observational study. RESULTS: Five-hundred and thirty participants completed the study. Location with route of administration was the most important attribute. Symptom relief during induction and withdrawal was a second priority. Mortality followed by side effects had lowest relative importance. Attribute levels with highest part-worth utilities showed patients preferred monthly pick-up from a pharmacy rather than daily supervised dosing; and oral medications more than injection/implants, despite the latter's infrequency. CONCLUSION: We measured treatment preferences among patients seeking to initiate OUD treatment to inform strategies to scale MOUD treatment uptake. Patients prioritize the route of administration in treatment preference-less frequent pick up, but also injections and implants were less preferred despite their convenience. Second, patients prioritize symptom relief during the induction and withdrawal procedures of medication. These transition periods influence the sustainability of treatment. Although health professionals prioritize mortality, it did not drive decision-making for patients. To our knowledge, this is the largest study on patients' preferences for MOUD among treatment-seeking people with OUD to date. Future analysis will evaluate patient preference heterogeneity to further target program planning, counseling, and decision aid development.",2023,Nov,J Subst Use Addict Treat,154,,209138,,10.1016/j.josat.2023.209138,37544510,#730,Muthulingam 2023,,,1
Elevated end-of-life spending: A new measure of potentially wasteful health care spending at the end of life.,Zhang Y; Gupta A; Nicholson S; Li J,"OBJECTIVE: To construct a new measure of end-of-life (EoL) spending-the elevated EoL spending-and examine its associations with measures of quality of care and patient and physician preferences in comparison with the commonly used total Medicare EoL spending measures. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING: Medicare claims data for a 20% random sample of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients, from the health care quality data for 2015-2016, from the Hospital Compare and the Medicare Geographic Variation public use file, and survey data about patient and physician preferences. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed the elevated EoL spending measure as the differential monthly spending between decedents and survivors with the same one-year mortality risk, where the risk was predicted using machine learning models. We then examined the associations of the hospital referral region (HRR)-level elevated EoL spending with various health care quality measures and with the survey-elicited patient and provider preferences. We also examined analogous associations for monthly total EoL spending on decedents. DATA EXTRACTION METHODS: Medicare FFS patients who were continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A & B in 2015 and were alive as of January 1, 2016. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found a large variation in the elevated EoL spending across HRRs in the United States. There was no evidence of an association between HRR-level elevated EoL spending and established health care quality measures, including those specific to EoL care, whereas total EoL spending was positively associated with certain quality of care measures. We also found no evidence that elevated EoL spending was associated with patient preferences for EoL care. However, elevated EoL spending was positively and significantly associated with physician preferences for treatment intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that elevated EoL spending captures different resource use from conventional measures of EoL spending and may be more valuable in identifying potentially wasteful spending.",2023,Feb,Health Serv Res,58,1,186-194,,10.1111/1475-6773.14093,36303444,#1560,Zhang 2023,,,0
Assessment of the Massachusetts Flexible Services Program to Address Food and Housing Insecurity in a Medicaid Accountable Care Organization.,McCurley JL; Fung V; Levy DE; McGovern S; Vogeli C; Clark CR; Bartels S; Thorndike AN,"IMPORTANCE: Health systems are increasingly addressing health-related social needs. The Massachusetts Flexible Services program (Flex) is a 3-year pilot program to address food insecurity and housing insecurity by connecting Medicaid accountable care organization (ACO) enrollees to community resources. OBJECTIVE: To understand barriers and facilitators of Flex implementation in 1 Medicaid ACO during the first 17 months of the program. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This mixed-methods qualitative evaluation study from March 2020 to July 2021 used the Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance/Practical, Robust Implementation, and Sustainability Model (RE-AIM/PRISM) framework. Two Mass General Brigham (MGB) hospitals and affiliated community health centers were included in the analysis. Quantitative data included all MGB Medicaid ACO enrollees. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 members of ACO staff and 17 Flex enrollees. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reach was assessed by the proportion of ACO enrollees who completed annual social needs screening (eg, food insecurity and housing insecurity) and the proportion and demographics of Flex enrollees. Qualitative interviews examined other RE-AIM/PRISM constructs (eg, implementation challenges, facilitators, and perceived effectiveness). RESULTS: Of 67 098 Medicaid ACO enrollees from March 2020 to July 2021 (mean [SD] age, 28.8 [18.7] years), 38 442 (57.3%) completed at least 1 social needs screening; 10 730 (16.0%) screened positive for food insecurity, and 7401 (11.0%) screened positive for housing insecurity. There were 658 (1.6%) adults (mean [SD] age, 46.6 [11.8] years) and 173 (0.7%) children (<21 years; mean [SD] age, 10.1 [5.5]) enrolled in Flex; of these 831 people, 613 (73.8%) were female, 444 (53.4%) were Hispanic/Latinx, and 172 (20.7%) were Black. Most Flex enrollees (584 [88.8%] adults; 143 [82.7%] children) received the intended nutrition or housing services. Implementation challenges identified by staff interviewed included administrative burden, coordination with community organizations, data-sharing and information-sharing, and COVID-19 factors (eg, reduced clinical visits). Implementation facilitators included administrative funding for enrollment staff, bidirectional communication with community partners, adaptive strategies to identify eligible patients, and raising clinician awareness of Flex. In Flex enrollee interviews, those receiving nutrition services reported increased healthy eating and food security; they also reported higher program satisfaction than Flex enrollees receiving housing services. Enrollees who received nutrition services that allowed for selecting food based on preferences reported higher satisfaction than those not able to select food. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This mixed-methods qualitative evaluation study found that to improve implementation, Medicaid and health system programs that address social needs may benefit from providing funding for administrative costs, developing bidirectional data-sharing platforms, and tailoring support to patient preferences.",2023,Jun,JAMA Health Forum,4,6,e231191,,10.1001/jamahealthforum.2023.1191,37266960,#1171,McCurley 2023,,,0
Healthcare Provider Administration of Biologics for Patients with Plaque Psoriasis: Literature Review and Clinical Considerations.,Brunner M; Holyoak K; DiRuggiero D,"OBJECTIVE: Plaque psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, immune-mediated skin disease. Biologic therapies markedly improve skin disease severity and health-related quality of life for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. All but two of the biologics approved in the United States for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis may be self-administered by adult patients via subcutaneous injection. This review discusses rationales for choosing healthcare provider (HCP) administration over self-administration of biologics for patients with plaque psoriasis, including treatment adherence, patient preference, and practical considerations. METHODS: PubMed was searched for ""psoriasisAND biologic AND administration AND (office OR provider OR profession)."" The most relevant results and additional papers identified from the references were included in the review. RESULTS: Although many patients prefer self-administration, others may benefit from HCP administration. Key considerations in the choice between HCP vs. self-administration of biologics for plaque psoriasis treatment include adherence, patient preferences, and practical concerns. Patient characteristics that may make HCP administration of biologic therapies for treatment of plaque psoriasis preferable to at-home self-administration are discussed. LIMITATIONS: There are few published studies specific to HCP administration of biologics for treatment of psoriasis. CONCLUSION: Administration of biologics by an HCP may improve treatment adherence and clinical outcomes compared to self-administration in selected patients with plaque psoriasis.",2023,Dec,J Clin Aesthet Dermatol,16,12 Suppl 2,S20-S25,,,38464741,#587,Brunner 2023,,,0
Characteristics of international primary care practices and physicians related to advance care planning: a cross-sectional survey study.,Nowels MA; Nowels D; Sheffler J; Lum HD,"BACKGROUND: Primary care providers (PCPs) are well-situated to delivery primary palliative care such as advance care planning (ACP). The aim of this work is to identify practice characteristics, including features found in advanced primary care models (APCMs), that predict PCP engagement of patients in ACP. METHODS: We analyzed characteristics of physician respondents and their practices associated with ACP conversations in older and sicker patients using data from 11 countries who participated in the 2015 Commonwealth Fund International Survey of Primary Care Physicians in 10 Nations. The primary outcome was how routinely these ACP conversations are reported. We used a validated measure to describe practice-level characteristics of advanced primary care models. We conducted bivariate and multivariable analyses to determine PCP and practice characteristics associated with routinely engaging patients in ACP and with documenting patient preferences in medical records. RESULTS: Respondents (N = 12,049) predominantly were older than 45 and did not view their jobs as high stress. PCPs reported routinely engaging patients in ACP work in practices with more APCM features. They are more likely to view their jobs as high stress, to work more hours, to practice in rural areas, and to work in smaller practices. Multivariable analyses showed that older PCP age, higher perceived stress of the job, practice location in rural areas, and increased number of APCM features were associated with more ACP conversations. Increased number of APCM features was also associated with higher odds of routinely recording patient preferences in their medical records. CONCLUSIONS: In this international survey, physician and practice characteristics, including having features associated with APCMs, were associated with whether physicians routinely discuss ACP with patients who are older and sicker. Many features of APCMs may facilitate ACP discussions between PCPs and patients.",2023,Jul,BMC Prim Care,24,1,146,,10.1186/s12875-023-02103-8,37452276,#1061,Nowels 2023,,,0
Scar Ectopic Pregnancy as an Uncommon Site of Ectopic Pregnancy: A Case Report and Literature Review.,Elawad M; Alyousef SZH; Alkhaldi NK; Alamri FA; Bakhsh H,"A cesarean scar pregnancy is a rare type of ectopic pregnancy that occurs when a fertilized egg implants in the scar from a previous cesarean section. It is a serious condition that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality if not managed promptly and appropriately. In this literature review and case report, we discuss the etiology, diagnosis, and management of cesarean scar pregnancy. We conducted a comprehensive search of relevant literature using electronic databases and included studies that reported on the diagnosis and management of cesarean scar pregnancy. We also present a case report of a patient with cesarean scar pregnancy who was managed surgically. The diagnosis of cesarean scar pregnancy is primarily done via transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound, and medical or surgical management can be used depending on the gestational age, hemodynamic status, and patient preferences. The surgical approach, which involves hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, or laparotomy, is usually preferred, since it is associated with fast recovery and lower recurrence rates. However, it is crucial to consider the patient's plans for future fertility when selecting the management approach. In conclusion, cesarean scar pregnancy is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt and appropriate management. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent significant morbidity and mortality, and surgical management is usually preferred due to its higher success rates and lower recurrence rates.",2023,Oct,Life (Basel),13,11,,,10.3390/life13112151,38004291,#755,Elawad 2023,,,0
Using a discrete choice experiment to elicit patients' preferences and willingness-to-pay for knee osteoarthritis treatments in Thailand.,Luksameesate P; Tanavalee A; Ngorsuraches S; Taychakhoonavudh S,"Osteoarthritis is the most common type of joint disease among elderly patients around the world. In response to the need for patient-centered care, patients' and physicians' preferences for knee osteoarthritis treatments have been studied in multiple countries, but not in Thailand. The objective of this study was to investigate Thai patients' preferences and their willingness to pay (WTP) for knee osteoarthritis treatments by using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Six knee osteoarthritis treatment attributes, including pain relief, delayed disease progression, gastrointestinal side effects, kidney side effects, cardiovascular side effects, and cost, were used to develop a paper-based, DCE questionnaire survey. Patients with knee osteoarthritis, who were at least 18 years old and who provided written informed consent, were recruited from the orthopedic department in a tertiary care hospital in Thailand via convenience sampling. The conditional logit model was used to determine patients' preferences and WTP. The Institutional Review Board at Chulalongkorn University approved this study before it started. A total of 232 patients were collected and analyzed in this study. Patients preferred treatments with a higher efficacy (pain relief and delayed disease progression), a lower probability of side effects (gastrointestinal, kidney, and cardiovascular side effects), and a lower cost. Regarding efficacy and side effects, the patients weighted the importance of a 1% change in cardiovascular side effects (- 0.08) more heavily than 1% changes in kidney (- 0.07) and gastrointestinal (- 0.02) side effects, delayed disease progression (0.02), and pain relief (0.01). Patients were willing to pay 29.56 Thai Baht (THB) and 41.84 THB per month for every 1% increase in pain relief and delayed disease progression, respectively. Conversely, patients were willing to pay 52.04 THB, 145.18 THB and 164.23 THB per month for every 1% decrease in gastrointestinal, kidney, and cardiovascular side effects, respectively. In conclusion, pain relief, delayed disease progression, gastrointestinal side effects, kidney side effects, cardiovascular side effects, and the cost of treatment were significant factors among patients undergoing knee osteoarthritis treatment. Additionally, patients had a higher WTP for delayed disease progression than pain relief and a higher WTP for a reduced probability of cardiovascular side effects than gastrointestinal and kidney side effects. These findings could be used to support treatment decisions for knee osteoarthritis patients in Thailand.",2023,Jul,Sci Rep,13,1,12154,,10.1038/s41598-023-39264-6,37500677,#1041,Luksameesate 2023,,,1
Group sequential two-stage preference designs.,Liu R; Li F; Esserman D; Ryan MM,"The two-stage preference design (TSPD) enables inference for treatment efficacy while allowing for incorporation of patient preference to treatment. It can provide unbiased estimates for selection and preference effects, where a selection effect occurs when patients who prefer one treatment respond differently than those who prefer another, and a preference effect is the difference in response caused by an interaction between the patient's preference and the actual treatment they receive. One potential barrier to adopting TSPD in practice, however, is the relatively large sample size required to estimate selection and preference effects with sufficient power. To address this concern, we propose a group sequential two-stage preference design (GS-TSPD), which combines TSPD with sequential monitoring for early stopping. In the GS-TSPD, pre-planned sequential monitoring allows investigators to conduct repeated hypothesis tests on accumulated data prior to full enrollment to assess study eligibility for early trial termination without inflating type I error rates. Thus, the procedure allows investigators to terminate the study when there is sufficient evidence of treatment, selection, or preference effects during an interim analysis, thereby reducing the design resource in expectation. To formalize such a procedure, we verify the independent increments assumption for testing the selection and preference effects and apply group sequential stopping boundaries from the approximate sequential density functions. Simulations are then conducted to investigate the operating characteristics of our proposed GS-TSPD compared to the traditional TSPD. We demonstrate the applicability of the design using a study of Hepatitis C treatment modality.",2024,Jan,Stat Med,43,2,315-341,,10.1002/sim.9962,38010193,#450,Liu 2024,,,0
"Association of Race, Ethnicity, Insurance, and Language and Rate of Breast-Conserving Therapy Among Women With Nonmetastatic Breast Cancer at an Urban, Safety-Net Hospital.",Fefferman A; Beaulieu-Jones BR; Shewmaker G; Zhang T; Sachs T; Merrill A; Ko NY; Cassidy MR,"INTRODUCTION: Breast-conserving therapy (BCT), specifically breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and adjuvant radiation, provides an equivalent alternative to mastectomy for eligible patients. However, previous studies have shown that BCT is underused in the United States, particularly among marginalized demographic groups. In this study, we examine the association between race, ethnicity, insurance, and language and rate of BCS among patients treated at an academic, safety-net hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 520 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer diagnosed and treated at an academic, safety-net hospital (2009-2014). We assessed eligibility for BCT and then differences in the rate of BCT among eligible patients by race, ethnicity, insurance, and language. Reasons for not undergoing BCT were documented. RESULTS: Median age was 60 y; 55.9% were non-White, 31.9% were non-English-speaking, 15.6% were Hispanic, and 47.4% were Medicaid/uninsured. Three hundred seventy one (86.3%) underwent BCS; within this group, 324 (87.3%) completed adjuvant radiation. Among patients undergoing mastectomy, 30 patients (36.7%) were eligible for BCT; within this group, reasons for mastectomy included patient preference (n = 28) and to avoid possible re-excision or adjuvant radiation in patients with significant comorbidities (n = 2). Eligibility for BCT varied by ethnicity (Hispanic [100%], Non-Hispanic [92%], P = 0.02), but not race, language, or insurance. Among eligible patients, rate of BCS varied by age (<50 y [84.9%], ≥50 y [92.9%], P = 0.01) and ethnicity (Hispanic [98.5%], Non-Hispanic [91.3%], P = 0.04), but not race, language, or insurance. CONCLUSIONS: At our safety-net hospital, the rate of BCS among eligible patients did not vary by race, language, or insurance. Excluding two highly comorbid patients, all patients who underwent mastectomy despite being eligible for BCT were counseled regarding BCS and expressed a preference for mastectomy. Further research is needed to understand the value of BCT in the treatment of breast cancer, to ensure informed decision-making, address potential misconceptions regarding BCT, and advance equitable care for all patients.",2023,Nov,J Surg Res,291,,403-413,,10.1016/j.jss.2023.06.009,37517348,#732,Fefferman 2023,,,0
"Access to device-aided therapies in advanced Parkinson's disease: navigating clinician biases, patient preference, and prognostic uncertainty.",Auffret M; Weiss D; Stocchi F; Vérin M; Jost WH,"Device-aided therapies (DAT), which include deep brain stimulation and pump-based continuous dopaminergic stimulation with either levodopa or apomorphine, are among the major advances in the clinical management of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although DAT are being increasingly offered earlier in the disease course, their classical indication remains advanced PD. Theoretically, every patient should be offered transition to DAT when faced with refractory motor and nonmotor fluctuations and functional decline. Worldwide clinical reality is far from these ideal, and, therefore, question the ""real-world"" equal opportunity of access to DAT for PD patients with advanced PD-even within a single health care system. Differences in access to care, referral pattern (timing and frequency), as well as physician biases (unconscious/implicit or conscious/explicit bias), and patients' preferences or health-seeking behaviour are to be considered. Compared to DBS, little information is available concerning infusion therapies, as well as neurologists' and patients' attitudes towards them. This viewpoint aims to be thought-provoking and to assist clinicians in moving through the process of DAT selection, by including in their decision algorithm their own biases, patient perspective, ethical concerns as well as the current unknowns surrounding PD prognosis and DAT-related long-term side effects for a given patient.",2023,Nov,J Neural Transm (Vienna),130,11,1411-1432,,10.1007/s00702-023-02668-9,37436446,#737,Auffret 2023,,,0
Patient Preferences for Adjuvant Treatment in Muscle-Invasive Urothelial Carcinoma: A Multi-Country Discrete Choice Experiment.,King-Concialdi K; Beusterien K; Senglaub SS; Will O; Jaffe DH; Patel MY; Harrison MR,"PURPOSE: The evolving treatment landscape in muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma creates challenges for clinicians and patients in selecting the most appropriate therapy. Here, we aimed to understand adjuvant treatment preferences among patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma who underwent radical resection, including tradeoffs between efficacy outcomes and toxicity risks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional study utilizing a discrete choice experiment was conducted across the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Germany via a web-based survey. Patients ≥18 years of age who self-reported as having been diagnosed with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma were included. Patients indicated their preferences between hypothetical treatment profiles varying in eight attributes relating to efficacy, regimen, and side effects. Preference weights were estimated using hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression; relative attribute importance estimates were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, 207 patients were included (age ≥56 years, 65.7%; male, 54.1%). Patients chose adjuvant treatment 91.2% of the time vs no treatment. Prolonging overall survival from 25 to 78 months was most important, followed by reducing serious side effect risks. Increasing disease-free survival from 12 to 24 months was more important than decreasing risks of fatigue from 54% to 15% and nausea from 53% to 7%. Treatment with the shortest dosing regimen was more important for patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy; prolonging overall survival was more important than reducing the risk of a serious side effect in non-US patients; the opposite was found in the United States. CONCLUSION: Patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma who underwent radical resection preferred adjuvant treatment over no treatment regardless of side effects. Patients prioritized overall survival improvements followed by a reduced side effect profile.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,2237-2248,,10.2147/PPA.S411751,37706208,#883,King-Concialdi 2023,,,1
"The perspective of Polish patients with rheumatoid arthritis - treatment expectations, patient-reported outcomes, and digital literacy (the SENSE study).",Stajszczyk M; Świerkowska G; Smolik K; Domysławska I; Charkiewicz K; Samborski W,"INTRODUCTION: A widely accepted treat-to-target strategy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) requires the patient's perspective in making treatment decisions. However, data on treatment preferences and expectations of Polish patients with RA are scarce. The aim of the study was to determine the satisfaction with treatment and the nature of therapeutic preferences and expectations of Polish patients with moderate to severe RA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-two adult Polish patients with moderately to highly active RA were asked to complete patient-reported outcomes and patient-provided information questionnaires. Additionally, patient sociodemographic and clinical data and information on patient current and planned treatment strategies were collected. RESULTS: The mean global assessment of patient satisfaction with treatment was 64.1 ±24.6, below the level of indicating satisfaction. Rheumatoid arthritis negatively impacted patients' lives, resulting in a 37.8% impairment of work efficiency and 45% impairment of total activity. Primary treatment expectations for patients were lasting relief of RA symptoms, reduced pain and swelling in joints, increased flexibility of joints, and general improvement of arthritis. The most acceptable potential side effect was weight gain and the least acceptable were increases in the risk of cardiovascular disease, infection, and malignancies. The rapid onset of the drug effect (up to 1 week) was a preference of 48.1% of patients. Access to internet health resources was important for 44.2% of patients, but the median total eHealth literacy score in the study population was 24.0 (interquartile range: 20.5-28.0, range 8-37), which means low digital health literacy (DHL). CONCLUSIONS: Understanding these treatment preferences and expectations of patients with RA is essential for clinical practitioners to facilitate shared treatment decision-making. Digital health literacy data suggest the need of further improvement.",2023,,Reumatologia,61,5,331-338,,10.5114/reum/171625,37970121,#1608,Stajszczyk 2023,,,0
A Quantitative Framework for Medication Non-Adherence: Integrating Patient Treatment Expectations and Preferences.,Muiruri C; van den Broek-Altenburg EM; Bosworth HB; Cené CW; Gonzalez JM,"INTRODUCTION: Medication non-adherence remains a significant challenge in healthcare, impacting treatment outcomes and the overall effectiveness of medical interventions. This article introduces a novel approach to understanding and predicting medication non-adherence by integrating patient beliefs, efficacy expectations, and perceived costs. Existing theoretical models often fall short in quantifying the impact of barrier removal on medication adherence and struggle to address cases where patients consciously choose not to follow prescribed medication regimens. In response to these limitations, this study presents an empirical framework that seeks to provide a quantifiable model for both individual and population-level prediction of non-adherence under different scenarios. METHODS: We present an empirical framework that includes a health production function, specifically applied to antihypertensive medications nonadherence. Data collection involved a pilot study that utilized a double-bound contingent-belief (DBCB) questionnaire. Through this questionnaire, participants could express how efficacy and side effects were affected by controlled levels of non-adherence, allowing for the estimation of sensitivity in health outcomes and costs. RESULTS: Parameters derived from the DBCB questionnaire revealed that on average, patients with hypertension anticipated that treatment efficacy was less sensitive to non-adherence than side effects. Our derived health production function suggests that patients may strategically manage adherence to minimize side effects, without compromising efficacy. Patients' inclination to manage medication intake is closely linked to the relative importance they assign to treatment efficacy and side effects. Model outcomes indicate that patients opt for full adherence when efficacy outweighs side effects. Our findings also indicated an association between income and patient expectations regarding the health of antihypertensive medications. CONCLUSION: Our framework represents a pioneering effort to quantitatively link non-adherence to patient preferences. Preliminary results from our pilot study of patients with hypertension suggest that the framework offers a viable alternative for evaluating the potential impact of interventions on treatment adherence.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,3135-3145,,10.2147/PPA.S434640,38077791,#584,Muiruri 2023,,,0
American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Practice Guideline: Pharmacological Management of Chronic Idiopathic Constipation.,Chang L; Chey WD; Imdad A; Almario CV; Bharucha AE; Diem S; Greer KB; Hanson B; Harris LA; Ko C; Murad MH; Patel A; Shah ED; Lembo AJ; Sultan S,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is a common disorder associated with significant impairment in quality of life. This clinical practice guideline, jointly developed by the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology, aims to inform clinicians and patients by providing evidence-based practice recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of CIC in adults. METHODS: The American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that conducted systematic reviews of the following agents: fiber, osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol, magnesium oxide, lactulose), stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, senna), secretagogues (lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide), and serotonin type 4 agonist (prucalopride). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to assess the certainty of evidence for each intervention. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop clinical recommendations based on the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 10 recommendations for the pharmacological management of CIC in adults. Based on available evidence, the panel made strong recommendations for the use of polyethylene glycol, sodium picosulfate, linaclotide, plecanatide, and prucalopride for CIC in adults. Conditional recommendations were made for the use of fiber, lactulose, senna, magnesium oxide, and lubiprostone. DISCUSSION: This document provides a comprehensive outline of the various over-the-counter and prescription pharmacological agents available for the treatment of CIC. The guidelines are meant to provide a framework for approaching the management of CIC; clinical providers should engage in shared decision making based on patient preferences as well as medication cost and availability. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted to help guide future research opportunities and enhance the care of patients with chronic constipation.",2023,Jun,Am J Gastroenterol,118,6,936-954,,10.14309/ajg.0000000000002227,37204227,#1189,Chang 2023,,,0
Structural barriers or patient preference? A mixed methods appraisal of medical abortion use in England and Wales.,Footman K,"Although patient choice of abortion method is a key component of quality care, medical abortion (MA) has become the most common method (87%) in England and Wales, as in many countries worldwide. This research aimed to critically examine factors influencing the growth in MA use in England and Wales. Mixed methods were used, combining multi-level regression analysis of national abortion statistics (2011-2020) and key informant interviews with abortion service managers, commissioners, and providers (n=27). Overall trends have been driven by growth in MA use for abortions under 10 weeks in the private non-profit sector. Variation in MA use between patient sub-groups and regions has narrowed over time. Qualitative findings highlight health system constraints that have influenced the shift towards MA, including workforce constraints, infrastructure requirements, provider policies, cost, and commissioning practices involving under-funding and competition, which have caused the private non-profit sector to limit method choice across their services to remain financially viable. While removal of legal restrictions on MA has expanded choice, similar policy progress has not been seen for surgical methods. The study concludes that abortion method choice has been constrained by structural health system factors, with potential negative consequences for service acceptability, inequalities, and patient-centredness.",2023,Jun,Health Policy,132,,104799,,10.1016/j.healthpol.2023.104799,37001286,#1200,Footman 2023,,,0
Patient Perspectives on the Burden and Prevention of Diabetes-Related Foot Disease.,Crowley B; Drovandi A; Seng L; Fernando ME; Ross D; Golledge J,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to understand patient perspectives about the impact and prevention of diabetes-related foot disease (DFD). METHODS: An online survey was distributed to patients with a history of DFD during 2020. The survey was designed alongside clinical specialists and DFD patients and utilized the health belief model. It asked about the impact of DFD on health, perceptions on preventive strategies, perceived need for additional support, and patient preferences for telehealth in DFD management. Quantitative data were summarized descriptively and compared between groups. Open-text responses were analyzed using conceptual content analysis. RESULTS: Of 80 participants with a history of DFD, foot ulcers were the complication most often experienced, with over two-thirds having been admitted to hospital for a DFD-related issue and over one-third having a DFD-related amputation. Participants had ranging perceptions on the effect of DFD on health, from minimal to crippling. Those with previous severe DFD complications leading to hospital admission found a lack of mobility and independence the consequences of most concern. Using offloading footwear was perceived as very important for preventing DFD complications, although the use of offloading footwear was low, with participants citing issues relating to cost, comfort, appearance, and access to footwear as barriers to better adherence. Perceptions on telehealth were mixed, with many participants not having access to or being comfortable with the use of digital technologies.

Patient preferences for operative versus nonoperative treatment of LC1 pelvis fracture: a discrete choice experiment.,Patterson JT; Parry JA; Working ZM; McKibben NA; Baca J; Duong A; Senior J; Kim A; Marchand LS; O'Hara N,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify how patients with LC1 pelvis fracture value attributes of operative versus nonoperative treatment. METHODS: Design: Discrete choice experiment. SETTING: 3 US Level 1 trauma centers. PATIENT SELECTION CRITERIA: Adult survivors of an LC1 pelvis treated between June 2016 through March 2023 were identified from institutional registries. The choice experiment was administered as a survey from March through August 2023. OUTCOME MEASURES AND COMPARISONS: Participants chose between 12 hypothetical comparisons of treatment attributes including operative or nonoperative care, risk of death, severity of pain, risk of secondary surgery, shorter hospital stay, discharge destination, and independence in ambulation within one month of injury. The marginal utility of each treatment attribute, e.g. the strength of participants' aggregate preference for an attribute as indicated by their survey choices, was estimated by multinomial logit modeling with and without stratification by treatment received. RESULTS: 449 eligible patients were identified. The survey was distributed to 182 patients and collected from 72 (39%) patients at a median 2.3 years after injury. Respondents were 66% female with a median age of 59 years (IQR 34-69). Before injury, 94% ambulated independently and 75% were working. 41% received operative treatment. Independence with ambulation provided the highest relative marginal utility (21%, p<0.001), followed by discharge to home versus skilled nursing (20%, p<0.001), moderate versus severe post-discharge pain (17%, p<0.001), shorter hospital stay (16%, p<0.001), secondary surgery (15%, p<0.001), mortality (10%, p=0.02). Overall, no relative utility for operative versus nonoperative treatment was observed (2%, p=0.54). However, respondents strongly preferred the treatment they received: operative patients valued operative treatment (utility, 0.37 vs. -0.37, p<0.001); nonoperative patients valued nonoperative treatment (utility, 0.19 vs. -0.19, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: LC1 pelvis fracture patients valued independence with ambulation, shorter hospital stay, and avoiding secondary surgery and mortality in the month after their injury. Patients preferred the treatment they received rather than operative versus nonoperative care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic level III.

Association of clinicopathologic variables and patient preference with the choice of surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer: A registry-based study.,Söderberg E; Wärnberg F; Wennstig AK; Nilsson G; Garmo H; Holmberg L; Blomqvist C; Sund M; Wadsten C,"INTRODUCTION: Observational studies suggest that breast conserving surgery (BCS) and radiotherapy (RT) offers superior survival compared to mastectomy. The aim was to compare patient and tumour characteristics in women with invasive breast cancer ≤30 mm treated with either BCS or mastectomy, and to explore the underlying reason for choosing mastectomy. METHODS: Women registered with breast cancer ≤30 mm and ≤4 positive axillary lymph nodes in the Swedish National Breast Cancer Register 2013-2016 were included. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association of tumour and patient characteristics with receiving a mastectomy vs. BCS. RESULTS: Of 1860 breast cancers in 1825 women, 1346 were treated by BCS and 514 by mastectomy. Adjuvant RT was given to 1309 women (97.1 %) after BCS and 146 (27.6 %) after mastectomy. Variables associated with receiving a mastectomy vs. BCS included clinical detection (Odds Ratio (OR) 4.15 (95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 3.35-5.14)) and clinical stage (T2 vs. T1 (OR 3.68 (95 % CI 2.90-4.68)), N1 vs. N0 (OR 2.02 (95 % CI 1.38-2.96)). Women receiving mastectomy more often had oestrogen receptor negative, HER2 positive tumours of higher histological grade.

Interscalene block vs. periarticular liposomal bupivacaine for pain control following reverse shoulder arthroplasty: a randomized trial.,Schumaier A; Kloby M; Hasselfeld K; Grawe B,"BACKGROUND: Interscalene nerve blocks and local anesthetic infiltration are 2 methods commonly used in multimodal analgesia regimens for shoulder arthroplasty. Liposomal bupivacaine is a novel anesthetic that can be detected more than 24 hours following local administration. Studies comparing liposomal bupivacaine with conventional analgesic methods have found mixed results regarding pain and narcotic consumption, and there is little information available regarding patient satisfaction and the role of psychosocial variables. METHODS: This is a randomized study of 76 adult patients undergoing reverse shoulder arthroplasty who were assigned to receive a preoperative interscalene nerve block with ropivacaine (Block = 38) or an intraoperative periarticular injection of liposomal bupivacaine (Local = 38). The primary outcomes were narcotic consumption (MEq, morphine equivalents), visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, and satisfaction (0-10). The secondary outcomes were the effect of patient group preference (Block vs. Local) and psychosocial variables (Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Brief Resilience Scale) on satisfaction. Length of stay, pain-related phone calls, pain-related readmissions, and the number of narcotic refills were tracked from the day of surgery through the first postoperative appointment, which was routinely 7-14 days following surgery. RESULTS: Intraoperative and day 0 narcotic consumption was lower in the Block group by 17.3 and 21.6 MEq (P < .001, P = .035) with no differences on day 1 or 2. There was no difference in VAS pain scores, length of stay, pain-related phone calls, pain-related readmissions, or the number of narcotic refills. Patient satisfaction was higher in the Block group (8.3 vs. 6.8, P = .017). Pain catastrophizing, resilience, and patient group preference did not have any significant relationship with patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing reverse shoulder arthroplasty have higher satisfaction with a conventional interscalene block compared to a periarticular injection of liposomal bupivacaine. There were no clinically important differences in narcotic consumption, VAS pain scores, length of stay, pain-related phone calls, pain-related readmissions, or the number of narcotic refills. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Brief Resilience Scale, and patient preferences did not have any relationship with patient satisfaction.",2023,Jul,J Shoulder Elbow Surg,32,7,1412-1419,,10.1016/j.jse.2023.02.137,37003430,#1127,Schumaier 2023,,,0
Post-operative Surveillance Following Curative Resection of Colorectal Cancer in the Elderly Population in the United Kingdom: An Observational Study.,Shekleton FE; Baker WC; Courtney ED,"Background Colorectal cancer most commonly affects the elderly population. Post-colorectal cancer surveillance aims to reduce cancer incidence and mortality, but its necessity and effectiveness are debated, especially in the elderly population. This study explores the relevance of computer tomography (CT) and colonoscopy surveillance in patients aged 75 and over who have undergone curative resection for colorectal cancer. Methods A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted on patients aged 75 and over who had undergone surgical resection of colorectal cancer between November 2014 and August 2021. Data on demographics, treatment, survival, and surveillance were gathered from electronic patient records. The primary outcome was adherence to follow-up colonoscopy and CT-scan surveillance following surgery. Results A total of 417 patients underwent colorectal cancer surgery, with 334 included for analysis. The cohort had an average age of 81 years, with the majority receiving laparoscopic surgery and primary anastomosis. Twelve-month CT surveillance showed normal results in 281 patients (91.8%), while 24-month CT surveillance demonstrated normal findings in 244 patients (88.7%). Only 175 patients (52.4%) had colonoscopy follow-up, with 94 (53.7%) showing normal results, 74 (42.3%) demonstrating benign polyps, and two patients (1.1%) having histologically proven cancer. Reasons for not undergoing colonoscopy included declining invitations (30 patients, 19.1%) and being too frail (45 patients, 28.7%). Conclusion This study reinforces the notion that colonoscopy surveillance for patients over the age of 75 may have limited benefits. In an ageing population, the benefits of surveillance in terms of early detection of recurrence must be balanced against the risks of harm from the procedure, the availability of further management, cost-effectiveness, and patient preferences. An individualised approach should be adopted, potentially with colonoscopy surveillance only recommended in patients of higher risk (extramural venous invasion (EMVI)) and a low frailty score with a life expectancy over 10 years.",2023,Nov,Cureus,15,11,e49072,,10.7759/cureus.49072,38125234,#672,Shekleton 2023,,,0

Patient preferences in the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain: a systematic review of discrete choice experiments.,Zhu M; Dong D; Lo HH; Wong SY; Mo PK; Sit RW,"Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is a preference-sensitive condition for which numerous treatment options are available, each with benefits and risks. Thus, patient preferences play a critical role in decision making. This study summarized evidence from discrete choice experiments (DCEs) to quantify patient preferences for CMP treatment and identified important treatment attributes. A systematic review of DCEs on patient preferences for CMP treatment was conducted. Studies were included if they used DCE to determine patient preferences for CMP. A previously described methodological assessment tool was used to assess the risk of bias. The treatment attributes were summarized and sorted according to the frequency of citation and relative weight. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the intervention-specific attributes. A total of 15 eligible studies with 4065 participants were included. We identified ""capacity to realize daily life activities,"" ""risk of adverse events,"" ""effectiveness in pain reduction,"" and ""out-of-pocket cost"" as important attributes. Although ""treatment frequency"" and ""onset of treatment efficacy"" were less frequently mentioned, they were also important attributes. The attribute of ""risk of adverse events"" was especially important for drug treatment. The ""out-of-pocket cost"" and ""treatment location and mode"" were important attributes of exercise therapy. The attributes identified in this review will inform the design of future DCE studies, facilitate the translation of measurement-based care to value-based care, and provide the rationale to promote shared decision making and patient-centered care.",2023,Apr,Pain,164,4,675-689,,10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002775,36149784,#1377,Zhu 2023,,,1
Long-term outcomes after plaque excision grafting for Peyronie's disease and subanalysis of patients who undergo the procedure despite preoperative counseling against it.,Langbo WA; Wang V; Bajic P; Levine L,"BACKGROUND: Plaque excision and grafting (PEG) has been recommended for patients with Peyronie's disease (PD) with >60° curvature and/or hinge effect and strong preoperative erections, while placement of an inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) is recommended when rigidity is suboptimal. Nevertheless, many patients counseled to undergo an IPP decline and insist on proceeding with PEG due to personal preference or desire to avoid an implant. AIM: We aim to review long-term outcomes in patients who underwent PEG for PD at our institution and investigate whether there is any difference in long-term outcomes in patients who undergo PEG despite a recommendation to undergo IPP. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review from 2007 to 2021 on PEG surgery performed at a single tertiary care institution in patients ≥18 years old who had >3 months of follow-up. OUTCOMES: Postoperative information was gathered from the electronic medical record, including postoperative erectile function, patient satisfaction, and the ability to engage in penetrative sexual intercourse. RESULTS: An overall 251 patients underwent PEG with a median follow-up of 12 months (IQR, 6-54). Among these, 54 (22%) were initially advised to undergo IPP but elected for PEG. Patients who underwent PEG despite counseling to undergo IPP reported lower postoperative ability to engage in intercourse (51% vs 76%). Seven (13%) patients initially advised to undergo IPP eventually received an IPP, relative to 7 (4%) initially advised to undergo PEG. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Thorough preoperative assessment of erectile function and penile deformity can guide clinician counseling and manage patient expectations during decision making between PEG surgery and IPP implantation for PD. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature, high attrition to follow-up, and risk of recall and selection bias. This is a large study with a median follow-up of 12 months, with a high-volume single surgeon who treats patients in a specialized population of complex cases. CONCLUSION: Patients who were initially counseled to undergo IPP due to suboptimal erectile rigidity but elected for PEG had worse postoperative ability to engage in penetrative intercourse, and a higher proportion of these patients eventually received an IPP.",2024,Jan,J Sex Med,21,2,163-168,,10.1093/jsxmed/qdad164,38087916,#449,Langbo 2024,,,0
"Who Gets to Determine Whether Home Is ""Unsafe"" at the End of Life?",Zuo JX; Ruskin A; Bauer MR,"BACKGROUND: At the end of life, some patients wish to be discharged directly home from the hospital, but health care teams may consider this unsafe, raising concerns for capacity and risk. However, defining risk is subjective and impacted by values, preferences, and clinical status. Accommodating patient preferences in discharge destinations can promote autonomy, dignity, and quality of life at the end of life. OBSERVATIONS: We developed a risk assessment framework to help clinicians objectively identify risk factors and protective factors and develop a comprehensive discharge plan. We applied this framework to a veteran nearing the end of life and he was able to successfully return home from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Approaching end-of-life discharges with a framework can inform discharge planning and lessen the risk of adverse events. Importantly, this framework can help clinicians communicate better and partner with patients and their loved ones in prioritizing patient values and preferences.",2023,Nov,Fed Pract,40,11,368-372,,10.12788/fp.0434,38567121,#701,Zuo 2023,,,0
Using decision support tools for treatment decision making about antidepressants in outpatient psychiatric consultations.,Mat Lazim NH; Syed A; Lee C; Ahmed Abousheishaa A; Chong Guan N,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the use of decision support tools in decision making about antidepressants during conversations between patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and their psychiatrists. METHODS: Theme-oriented discourse analysis of two psychiatric consultation groups: control (n = 17) and intervention (n = 16). In the control group, only a doctor's conversation guide was used; in the intervention group, the conversation guide and a patient decision aid (PDA) were used. RESULTS: Psychiatrists mainly dominated conversations in both consultation groups. They were less likely to elicit patient treatment-related perspectives in the intervention group as they focused more on delivering the information than obtaining patient perspectives. However, using PDA in the intervention group slightly encouraged patients to participate in decisional talk. CONCLUSION: The decision support tools did promote SDM performance. Using the conversation guide in both consultation groups encouraged the elicitation of patient perspectives, which helped the psychiatrists in tailoring their recommendations of options based on patient preferences and concerns. Using the PDA in the intervention group created space for treatment discussion and fostered active collaboration in treatment decision making.

Comparison of dydrogesterone plus progesterone gel with subcutaneous aqueous progesterone plus progesterone gel for luteal phase supplementation of subsequent in vitro cycle in women after previous cycle failure.,Gawron IM; Chrostowski B; Derbisz K; Jach R; Pietrus M,"OBJECTIVES: The luteal phase supplementation (LPS) of the in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle is crucial to increase the chance of a live birth. There is no preferred progestogen for use in the general population. The optimal progestogen regimen in the event of prior IVF failure is unknown. The aim was to compare the live birth rate for dydrogesterone plus progesterone gel versus aqueous progesterone plus progesterone gel in LPS of the IVF cycle in women with at least one previous IVF failure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective randomized single-center study enrolled women with at least one previous IVF failure undergoing another IVF cycle. Women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 2 arms depending on LPS protocol: dydrogesterone (Duphaston®) + progesterone in vaginal gel (Crinone®) vs aqueous progesterone solution in subcutaneous injection (Prolutex®) + progesterone in vaginal gel (Crinone®). All women underwent fresh embryo transfer. RESULTS: The live birth rate with one prior IVF failure was 26.9% for D + PG vs 21.2% for AP + PG (p = 0.54), and with at least two IVF failures: 16% for D + PG vs 31.1% for AP + PG (p = 0.16). There were no significant differences in live birth rates between protocols, regardless of the number of prior IVF failures. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the evidence from this study that neither of the two LPS protocols is more effective in women with prior IVF failure, other factors, such as potential side effects, dosing convenience and patient preference, should be considered when choosing a treatment.",2023,Jul,Ginekol Pol,,,,,10.5603/GP.a2023.0062,37417377,#1072,Gawron 2023,,,0
'Ease of adaptation' predicts preferred spectacle prescriptions better than visual acuity: a retrospective analysis.,Hughes AR; Bullimore M; Elliott D,"CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Factors predicting patient acceptance of a new spectacle prescription need to be determined to make optimal prescribing decisions. BACKGROUND: Clinicians usually prescribe for best visual acuity. However, for some patients, a partial change is prescribed to ease adaptation, despite providing suboptimal visual acuity. This study seeks to develop an understanding of which factors predict patient preference between spectacle prescriptions by using a retrospective analysis to compare ease of adaptation, subjective quality of distance vision and optimal distance visual acuity. METHODS: A retrospective analysis utilised a 196-patient data set in which participants wore two prescriptions, one based on the subjective refraction of an optometrist modified by judgement and one on autorefractor results modified for ease of adaptation by an algorithm. Spectacles were worn for 3 weeks each, and participants responded to questions about which prescription they preferred and their quality of distance vision and ease of adaptation (on a 0-10 scale) with each prescription. A logistic regression analysed which variables predicted whether participants responded yes or no to the question 'If you had purchased these spectacles for $100 (US$200 adjusted to 2023 value), would you be happy with them?' RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the preferred and non-preferred prescriptions for the subjective quality of distance vision rating (medians 9 vs. 8; Z = -7.80, p < 0.0001) and ease of adaptation rating (medians 8 vs. 5; Z = -8.32, p < 0.0001) but the distance binocular visual acuity was not significantly different (both means = -0.09 logMAR; Z = -0.60, p = 0.55). Of all participants, 94% preferred the prescription deemed easier to adapt to but only 59% preferred the prescription with better subjective quality of distance vision and best visual acuity. CONCLUSION: Distance visual acuity was not found to be a useful predictor of participant preference to a new prescription and is likely over-relied upon in practice. The results support the adjustment of the subjective prescription where appropriate to aid patient adaptation and comfort.",2024,Jan,Clin Exp Optom,,,1-8,,10.1080/08164622.2024.2304060,38237266,#464,Hughes 2024,,,0
"Keeping It ""Current"": A Review of Treatment Options for the Management of Supraventricular Tachycardia.",Tednes P; Marquardt S; Kuhrau S; Heagler K; Rech M,"OBJECTIVE: To review treatment options and updates that exist for the management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). DATA SOURCES: A literature search of PubMed was performed including articles from 1974 to June 2023 using the terms: arrhythmias, adenosine, verapamil, diltiazem, esmolol, propranolol, metoprolol, beta-blockers, amiodarone, PSVT, synchronized cardioversion, methylxanthines, dipyridamole, pediatrics, heart transplant, and pregnancy. Primary literature and guidelines were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were considered if they were available in English and conducted in humans. DATA SYNTHESIS: PSVT is a subset of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that presents as a rapid, regular tachycardia with an abrupt onset and termination. Due to frequent emergency department (ED) visits annually with symptoms of PSVT, appropriate and efficient management of these patients is vital. This review provides an overview of the pathophysiology of PSVT, while also describing the literature behind nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of PSVT. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review describes new literature regarding the improved success of the modified Valsalva maneuver as a nonpharmacologic therapy in PSVT. In addition, it describes a new technique in administration of adenosine that has improved outcomes, defines dose adjustments needed for drug interactions with adenosine, compares the utilization of nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with adenosine, and provides management recommendations for patients in special populations.

Patients' perspectives on the relevance of biosimilars' outcomes in oncology: qualitative study with nominal group technique.,Vecoso LVZ; Silva MT; Livinalli A; Barreto JOM; Galvao TF,"PURPOSE: We aimed to rate the importance of outcomes from a systematic review about biosimilars in oncology from patients' perspective. METHODS: This is a qualitative research with nominal group technique. Patients with cancer were selected by convenience sampling and invited for two mediated virtual meetings in 2022. Twelve outcomes from a systematic review on biosimilars for oncology developed following a protocol were explained in plain language to participants who classified them as critical, important, or not important according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. We employed Iramuteq software for lexical categorization of the meeting transcripts, and content analysis for interpretation. RESULTS: Five women participated (three had metastatic cancer, one non-metastatic, one recurrent). Six outcomes were classified as critical: duration of response, progression-free survival, pathological complete response, overall survival, severe adverse events, and quality of life; three as important: mortality, event-free survival, and objective response; and three as non-important: neutralizing anti-drug antibody, any adverse event, and non-neutralizing anti-drug antibody. Duration of response, pathological complete response, severe adverse events, and quality of life were considered secondary in the review protocol, but critical by the patients. The main themes influencing the importance classification were related to the disease (progression and control) and treatment (recognition and healthcare setting). CONCLUSION: Patients rated most outcomes as critical or important, some of them previously regarded as secondary by the researchers, which reinforces the need to include stakeholders' perspectives in oncology research. Aspects of the disease progression and treatment effects influenced participants' judgment on outcomes' relevance.",2023,Nov,Support Care Cancer,31,12,722,,10.1007/s00520-023-08184-6,38008777,#658,VecosoLVZ 2023,,,0
"Latinx attitudes, barriers, and experiences with genetic counseling and testing: A systematic review.",Dron HA; Bucio D; Young JL; Tabor HK; Cho MK,"As genetics is increasingly used across clinical settings, there is a need to understand the impact and experiences of diverse patients. This review systematically examined research literature on Latinx experiences with genetic counseling and genetic testing (GC/GT) in the United States, synthesizing key themes and knowledge gaps pertaining to both patient experience and hypothetical scenarios. Findings were based on a systematic search, inclusion, and thematic analysis of 81 empirical peer-reviewed articles published from January 1990 to July 2019 pertaining to Latinx populations and GC/GT. Studies most commonly addressed Latinas' perspectives on GC/GT in prenatal settings or for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Costs, referrals, and communication were significant barriers to accessing genetic services for many Latinx patients, particularly those with low English proficiency (LEP). Studies highlighted difficulties accessing and communicating in healthcare settings, and how medical context and prior experience with healthcare workers and institutions influenced GC/GT decision-making. Providers' implicit biases about Latinx patients negatively impacted their care and impeded communication. Despite low awareness of cancer GT, Latinx patients often reported interest in learning more about GC/GT or unmet needs for GT discussion and provider involvement. This systematic review identified areas where providers can take action to improve Latinx experiences with GC/GT. Clinicians should elicit and respond to patient preferences about shared decision-making. For patients with low numeracy or LEP, providers should consider tailored educational and communication techniques. Most studies focused on HBOC and prenatal testing, and Latinx patients are heterogeneous, leaving many research questions about Latinx experience with GT/GC in other clinical areas.",2023,Feb,J Genet Couns,32,1,166-181,,10.1002/jgc4.1632,36301246,#1561,Dron 2023,,,0
Factors Influencing Primary Care Practitioners' Cancer Screening Recommendations for Older Adults: a Systematic Review.,Smith J; Dodd RH; Gainey KM; Naganathan V; Cvejic E; Jansen J; McCaffery KJ,"BACKGROUND: Primary care practitioners (PCPs) play a key role in cancer screening decisions for older adults (≥ 65 years), but recommendations vary by cancer type and jurisdiction. PURPOSE: To examine the factors influencing PCPs' recommendations for breast, cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer screening for older adults. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Pre-Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL, searched from 1 January 2000 to July 2021, and citation searching in July 2022. STUDY SELECTION: Assessed factors influencing PCPs' breast, prostate, colorectal, or cervical cancer screening decisions for older adults' (defined either as ≥ 65 years or < 10-year life expectancy). DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently conducted data extraction and quality appraisal. Decisions were crosschecked and discussed where necessary. DATA SYNTHESIS: From 1926 records, 30 studies met inclusion criteria. Twenty were quantitative, nine were qualitative, and one used a mixed method design. Twenty-nine were conducted in the USA, and one in the UK. Factors were synthesized into six categories: patient demographic characteristics, patient health characteristics, patient and clinician psycho-social factors, clinician characteristics, and health system factors. Patient preference was most reported as influential across both quantitative and qualitative studies. Age, health status, and life expectancy were also commonly influential, but PCPs held nuanced views about life expectancy. Weighing benefits/harms was also commonly reported with variation across cancer screening types. Other factors included patient screening history, clinician attitudes/personal experiences, patient/provider relationship, guidelines, reminders, and time. LIMITATIONS: We could not conduct a meta-analysis due to variability in study designs and measurement. The vast majority of included studies were conducted in the USA. CONCLUSIONS: Although PCPs play a role in individualizing cancer screening for older adults, multi-level interventions are needed to improve these decisions. Decision support should continue to be developed and implemented to support informed choice for older adults and assist PCPs to consistently provide evidence-based recommendations.

Patient motivators to use opioids for acute pain after emergency care.,Punches BE; Brown JL; Taul NK; Sall HA; Bakas T; Gillespie GL; Martin-Boone JE; Boyer EW; Lyons MS,"INTRODUCTION: Patients are stakeholders in their own pain management. Factors motivating individuals to seek or use opioids therapeutically for treatment of acute pain are not well characterized but could be targeted to reduce incident iatrogenic opioid use disorder (OUD). Emergency departments (EDs) commonly encounter patients in acute pain for whom decisions regarding opioid therapy are required. Decision-making is necessarily challenged in episodic, unscheduled care settings given time pressure, limited information, and lack of pre-existing patient provider relationship. Patients may decline to take prescribed opioids or conversely seek opioids from other providers or non-medical sources. METHODS: Using a framework analysis approach, we qualitatively analyzed transcripts from 29 patients after discharge from an ED visit for acute pain at a large, urban, academic hospital in the midwestern United States to describe motivating factors influencing patient decisions regarding opioid use for acute pain. A semi-structured interview guide framed participant discussion in either a focus group or interview transcribed and analyzed with conventional content analysis. RESULTS: Four major themes emerged from our analysis including a) pain management literacy, b) control preferences, c) risk tolerance, and d) cues to action.

miRNAs as cornerstones in chronic lymphocytic leukemia pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance- An emphasis on the interaction of signaling pathways.,Doghish AS; Abulsoud AI; Elshaer SS; Abdelmaksoud NM; Zaki MB; El-Mahdy HA; Ismail A; Fathi D; Elsakka EGE,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) accounts for the vast majority of cases of leukemia. Patients of advanced age are more likely to develop the condition, which has a highly varied clinical course. Consideration of illness features and preceding treatment sequence, as well as patient preferences and comorbidities, is necessary for selecting the appropriate treatment for the appropriate patient. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity to detect CLL early, monitor CLL patients, select the treatment responders, and reduce ineffective treatment, unwanted side effects, and unnecessary expenses. In both homeostasis and illness, microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) play a vital role as master regulators of gene expression and, by extension, protein expression. MiRNAs typically reduce the stability of mRNAs, including those encoding genes involved in tumorigenesis processes as cell cycle regulation, inflammation, stress response, angiogenesis, differentiation, apoptosis, and invasion. Due to their unique properties, miRNAs are rapidly being exploited as accurate biomarkers for illness detection, and medicines based on miRNA targets are finding widespread application in clinical practice. Accordingly, the current review serves as a quick primer on CLL and the biogenesis of miRNAs. In addition to providing a brief overview of the miRNAs whose function in the progression of CLL has been established by recent in vitro or in vivo research through articulating the influence of these miRNAs on a wide variety of cellular functions, including increased proliferative potential; support for angiogenesis; cell cycle aberration; evasion of apoptosis; promotion of metastasis; and reduced sensitivity to specific treatments.",2023,Mar,Pathol Res Pract,243,,154363,,10.1016/j.prp.2023.154363,36764011,#1448,Doghish 2023,,,0
Impact of patient choice and hospital competition on patient outcomes after rectal cancer surgery: A national population-based study.,Han L; Boyle JM; Walker K; Kuryba A; Braun MS; Fearnhead N; Jayne D; Sullivan R; van der Meulen J; Aggarwal A,"BACKGROUND: The objective of the current national cohort study was to analyze the correlation between choice and competition on outcomes after cancer surgery in rectal cancer. METHODS: The analysis included all men who underwent rectal cancer surgery in the English National Health Service between March 2015 and April 2019 (n = 13,996). Multilevel logistic regression was used to assess the effect of a rectal cancer surgery center being located in a competitive environment (based on the number of centers within a threshold distance) and being a successful competitor (based on the ability to attract patients from other hospitals) on eight patient-level outcomes: 30- and 90-day emergency readmissions, 30-day re-operation rates, 90-day postoperative mortality, length of stay >14 days, circumferential resection margin status, rates of primary procedure with a permanent stoma, and rates of persistent stoma 18 months after anterior resection. RESULTS: With adjustment for patient characteristics, patients who underwent surgery in centers located in a stronger competitive environment were less likely to have an abdominoperineal excision or a Hartman's procedure (odds ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.97, p = .04). Additionally, individuals who received treatment at hospitals that were successful competitors had a lower risk of a 90-day readmission following rectal cancer surgery (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.97, p = .03) and were less likely to have a persistent stoma at 18 months after anterior resection (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.93, p = .02).

Individualized Net Benefit estimation and meta-analysis using generalized pairwise comparisons in N-of-1 trials.,Giai J; Péron J; Roustit M; Cracowski JL; Roy P; Ozenne B; Buyse M; Maucort-Boulch D,"BACKGROUND: The Net Benefit (Δ) is a measure of the benefit-risk balance in clinical trials, based on generalized pairwise comparisons (GPC) using several prioritized outcomes and thresholds of clinical relevance. We extended Δ to N-of-1 trials, with a focus on patient-level and population-level Δ. METHODS: We developed a Δ estimator at the individual level as an extension of the stratum-specific Δ, and at the population-level as an extension of the stratified Δ. We performed a simulation study mimicking PROFIL, a series of 38 N-of-1 trials testing sildenafil in Raynaud's phenomenon, to assess the power for such an analysis with realistic data. We then reanalyzed PROFIL using GPC. This reanalysis was finally interpreted in the context of the main analysis of PROFIL which used Bayesian individual probabilities of efficacy. RESULTS: Simulations under the null showed good size of the test for both individual and population levels. The test lacked power when being simulated from the true PROFIL data, even when increasing the number of repetitions up to 140 days per patient. PROFIL individual-level estimated Δ were well correlated with the probabilities of efficacy from the Bayesian analysis while showing similarly wide confidence intervals. Population-level estimated Δ was not significantly different from zero, consistently with the previous Bayesian analysis.

Prolonged diversion after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis: Is it safe to wait?,Clancy C; Connelly TM; Jia X; Lipman J; Lightner AL; Hull T; Steele SR; Holubar SD,"AIM: Diverting loop ileostomy reversal (DLI-R) is routinely performed from 2-6 months following ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). The safety of delayed reversal after IPAA is not well-defined. The aim of this study was to determine if prolonged diversion is associated with adverse outcomes compared to routine closure. METHODS: Adult patients undergoing primary IPAA with DLI from 2000 to 2021 were included in this retrospective cohort study from our institutional database. Patients were stratified into tertiles based on timing of reversal: Routine (56-116 days), Delayed (117-180 days), or Prolonged (>6 months). Univariate analysis compared categorical variables between groups. Patients reversed at <8 weeks were excluded. RESULTS: In total, 2615 patients underwent DLI-R following IPAA (3-stage 61%, 2-stage 39%; mean age 39.9 years). DLI-R was performed as Routine, Delayed and Prolonged in 1908 (72.9%), 426 (16.4%) and 281 (10.8%), respectively. Overall, DLI-R related complications occurred in 12.4% (n = 324). The complication rate in the Routine group was 11% (n = 210), in the Delayed group was 12.2% (n = 52) and in the Prolonged group was 22.1% (n = 62). Reasons for prolonged diversion in the Prolonged group were complications at the time of IPAA in 207 (73.9%) or patient preference/scheduling in 73 (26.1%). DLI-R >6 months after IPAA due to complications had higher rates of overall complications following ileostomy reversal (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.85-3.72, p < 0.001) whereas when DLI-R was delayed due to preference/scheduling outcomes were not different than the Routine group (p = 0.28). CONCLUSION: Prolonged time to ileostomy reversal after IPAA is probably safe without increased risk of complications when due to patient preference.",2023,Jun,Colorectal Dis,25,6,1187-1193,,10.1111/codi.16560,36992540,#1201,Clancy 2023,,,0
"Robotic repair of moderate-sized midline ventral hernias reduced complications, readmissions, and length of hospitalization compared to open techniques.",Carter J; Ahamed F; Juprasert J; Anderson M; Lin M; Lebares C; Soriano I,"PURPOSE: To compare outcomes of robotic and open repair for uncomplicated, moderate-sized, midline ventral hernias. METHODS: From 2017 to 2021, patient characteristics and 30 day outcomes for all ventral hernias at our center were prospectively collected. We studied hernias potentially suitable for robotic repair: elective, midline, 3-10 cm rectus separation, no prior mesh, and no need for concomitant procedure. Robotic or open repair was performed by surgeon or patient preference. The primary outcome was any complication using Clavien-Dindo scoring. Secondary outcomes were operative time, length-of-stay, and readmissions. Regression identified predictors of complications. RESULTS: Of 648 hernias repaired, 70 robotic and 52 open repairs met inclusion criteria. The groups had similar patient demographics, co-morbidities, and hernia size, except that there were more immunosuppressed patients in the open group (11 versus 5 patients, p = 0.031). Complications occurred after 7 (13%) open repairs versus 2 (3%) robotic repairs, p = 0.036. Surgical site infection occurred after four open repairs but no robotic repair, p = 0.004. Length-of-stay averaged almost 3 days longer after open repair (4.3 ± 2.7 days versus 1.5 ± 1.4 days, p = 0.031). Readmission occurred after 6 (12%) oppen repairs but only 1 (1%) robotic repair. A long-term survey (61% response rate after mean follow-up of 2.8 years) showed that the HerQLes QOL score was better after robotic repair (46 ± 15 versus 40 ± 17,  = 0.049). In regression models, only open technique predicted complications. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic techniques were associated with fewer complications, shorter hospitalization, fewer infections, and fewer readmissions compared to open techniques. Open surgical technique was the only predictor of complications.",2024,Mar,J Robot Surg,18,1,142,,10.1007/s11701-024-01909-7,38554231,#203,Carter 2024,,,0
Anesthesia and postpartum pain management for placenta accreta spectrum: The healthcare provider perspective.,Bartels HC; Walsh D; Nieto-Calvache AJ; Lalor J; Terlezzi K; Cooney N; Palacios-Jaraquemada JM; O'Flaherty D; MacColgain S; Ffrench-O'Carroll R; Brennan DJ,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the management and experiences of healthcare providers around anesthetic care in placenta accreta spectrum (PAS). METHODS: This descriptive survey study was carried out over a 6-week period between January and March 2023. Healthcare providers, both anesthesiologists and those involved in operative care for women with PAS, were invited to participate. Questions invited both quantitative and qualitative responses. Qualitative responses were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: In all, 171 healthcare providers responded to the survey, the majority of whom were working in tertiary PAS referral centers (153; 89%) and 116 (70%) had more than 10 years of clinical experience. There was variation in the preferred primary mode of anesthesia for PAS cases; 69 (42%) used neuraxial only, but 58 (35%) used a combined approach of neuraxial and general anesthesia, with only 12 (8%) preferring general anesthesia. Ninety-nine (61%) were offering a routine antenatal anesthesia consultation. Content analysis of qualitative data identified three main themes, which were ""variation in approach to primary mode of anesthesia"", ""perspectives of patient preferences"", and ""importance of multidisciplinary team care"". These findings led to the development of a decision aid provided as part of this paper, which may assist clinicians in counseling women on their options for care to come to an informed decision. CONCLUSIONS: Approach to anesthesia for PAS varied between healthcare providers.

Patient and caregiver preferences for haemophilia treatments: A discrete-choice experiment.,Garcia VC; Mansfield C; Pierce A; Leach C; Smith JC; Afonso M,"INTRODUCTION: An evolving haemophilia treatment landscape provides new possibilities for previously unattainable lifestyles. AIM: We sought to understand how people with haemophilia (PwH) and their caregivers value the potential benefits of novel prophylactic treatments. We conducted a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) to quantify preferences for features of haemophilia treatments among adults and caregivers of children with haemophilia. A best-worst scaling (BWS) exercise measured the perceived burden of treatment administration features. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was administered to male adults (≥18 years) and caregivers of male children (≤17 years) living with haemophilia in the United States. Respondents evaluated eight pairs of hypothetical haemophilia treatment profiles defined by six attributes in the DCE and 15 features in the BWS. RESULTS: In the DCE, both adults with haemophilia (n = 151) and caregivers (n = 151) prioritised avoiding the risk of developing inhibitor/ anti-drug antibodies and treatments that allowed for a more active life. They placed a lower priority on reducing the number of spontaneous bleeding episodes, route and frequency of administration, and avoiding the risk of hospitalisation due to adverse events. The BWS documented the burdensomeness of IV infusions and medications that require mixing and refrigeration. CONCLUSION: PwH and caregivers prefer treatments that enable a more active lifestyle with a lower risk of inhibitor development. Both groups valued the ability to lead an active life over reducing spontaneous bleeding, with caregivers placing the most weight on this attribute. As new treatments expand possibilities, healthcare professionals and PwH should continue to share decision-making, incorporating clinical judgment and individual preferences.",2024,Mar,Haemophilia,30,2,375-387,,10.1111/hae.14928,38198352,#294,Garcia 2024,,,1
Effects of decision aids on breast reconstruction: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,Yang S; Yu L; Zhang C; Xu M; Tian Q; Cui X; Liu Y; Yu S; Cao M; Zhang W,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate the effects of decision aids for women facing breast reconstruction decision on decision conflict, decision regret, knowledge, satisfaction, anxiety and depression. BACKGROUND: Breast reconstruction decision is not good or bad and should be guided by clinical evidence and patient preferences. Decision aids can increase the patient's decision-making enthusiasm and ability, improve the quality of decision and promote shared decision-making between patients and medical staff. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Eight databases were conducted from the establishment of the database until October 2021. The PRISMA checklist was selected for analysis in this paper. The meta-analysis was conducted in Review Manager 5.3. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The result is decision conflict, decision regret, knowledge and other secondary outcomes. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were also conducted. RESULTS: A total of twelve randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed that decision aids could significantly reduce decision conflict and decision regret, improve knowledge, satisfaction and depression and had no influence on anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the systematic review and meta-analysis reviewed the positive effect of decision aids on the decision-making of women facing postmastectomy breast reconstruction. In the future, more well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm the effects of decision aids on the decision-making of breast reconstruction and nurses should be encouraged to take part in the development of decision aids in accordance with strict standards and apply them to breast cancer patients considering postmastectomy breast reconstruction.

Long-Term Outcome of Intact Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm After Endovascular or Open Repair.,Epple J; Svidlova Y; Schmitz-Rixen T; Böckler D; Lingwal N; Grundmann RT,"OBJECTIVE: Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) has been established as a standard treatment option for intact abdominal aortic aneurysm (iAAA) and gained importance due to a lower perioperative mortality than open repair (OAR). However, whether this survival advantage can be maintained or if OAR is beneficial in terms of long-term complications and reinterventions remains questionable. DESIGN: In this retrospective cohort study data from patients undergoing elective EVAR or OAR for iAAAs in the years 2010-2016 was analyzed. The patients were followed through 2018. METHODS: In the propensity score matched cohorts the perioperative and long-term outcomes of the patients were assessed. We identified 20 683 patients undergoing elective iAAA repair (76.4% EVAR). The propensity matched cohorts included 4886 pairs of patients. RESULTS: The perioperative mortality was 1.9% for EVAR and 5.9% for OAR (P = <.001). The perioperative mortality was mainly influenced by patients age (Odds-Ratio (OR):1.073, confidence interval (CI):1.058-1.088, P ≤ .001) and OAR (OR:3.242, CI:2.552-4.119, P ≤ .001). The early survival benefit after endovascular repair persisted for approximately 3 years (estimated survival EVAR 82.3%, OAR 80.9%, P = .021). After that time the estimated survival curves were similar. After 9 years the estimated survival was 51.2% after EVAR as compared to 52.8% after OAR (P = .102). The operation method didn't influence long-term survival significantly (Hazard-Ratio (HR): 1.046, CI: .975-1.122, P = .211). The vascular reintervention rate was 17.4% in the EVAR cohort and 7.1% in the OAR cohort (P ≤ .001). CONCLUSION: EVAR has a significantly lower perioperative mortality than OAR, a survival benefit that lasts up to 3 years after intervention. Thereafter, no significant difference in survival was observed between EVAR and OAR. The decision between EVAR or OAR may depend on patient preference, surgeons' experience, and the institutions' ability to handle complications.",2023,Nov,Vasc Endovascular Surg,57,8,829-837,,10.1177/15385744231178130,37224305,#740,Epple 2023,,,0

Expected Health Benefits of SGLT-2 Inhibitors and GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Older Adults.,Dadwani RS; Wan W; Skandari MR; Huang ES,"Background. Older and sicker adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) were underrepresented in randomized trials of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor-agonist (GLP1RA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2I), and thus, health benefits are uncertain in this population. Objective. To assess the impact of age, health status, and life expectancy in older adults with T2D on health benefits of GLP1RA and SGLT2I. Design. We used the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) model to simulate lifetime health outcomes. We calibrated the UKPDS model to improve mortality prediction in older adults using a common geriatric prognostic index. Participants. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013-2018 participants 65 y and older with T2D, eligible for GLP1RA or SGLT2I according to American Diabetes Association guidelines. Interventions. GLP1RA or SGLT2I use versus no additional medication. Main Measures. Lifetime complications and weighted life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) across overall treatment arms and life expectancies. Key Results. The overall older adult population was predicted to experience significant health benefits from GLP1RA (+0.29 LY [95% confidence interval: 0.27, 0.31], +0.15 QALYs [0.14, 0.16]) and SGLT2I (+0.26 LY [0.24, 0.28], +0.13 QALYs [0.12, 0.14]) as compared with no added medication. However, expected benefits declined in subgroups with shorter life expectancies. Participants with <4 y of life expectancy had minimal gains of <0.05 LY and <0.03 QALYs from added medication. Accounting for injection-related disutility, GLP1RA use reduced QALYs (-0.03 QALYs [-0.04, -0.02]). Conclusions. While GLP1RA and SGLT2I have substantial health benefits for many older adults with type 2 diabetes, benefits are not clinically significant in patients with <4 y of life expectancy. Life expectancy and patient preferences are important considerations when prescribing newer diabetes medications. HIGHLIGHTS: On average, older adults benefit significantly from SGLT2I and GLP1RA use. However, the benefits of these drugs are not clinically significant among older patients with life expectancy less than 4 y.There is potential harm in injectable GLP1RA use in the oldest categories of adults with type 2 diabetes.Heterogeneity in life expectancy and patient preferences for injectable versus oral medications are important to consider when prescribing newer diabetes medications.",2023,Jul-Dec,MDM Policy Pract,8,2,23814683231187566,,10.1177/23814683231187566,37492502,#1048,Dadwani 2023,,,0
Patient Preferences in Targeted Pharmacotherapy for Cancers: A Systematic Review of Discrete Choice Experiments.,Jiang S; Ren R; Gu Y; Jeet V; Liu P; Li S,"BACKGROUND: Targeted pharmacotherapy has been increasingly applied in cancer treatment due to its breakthroughs. However, the unmet needs of cancer patients are still significant, highlighting the urgency to investigate patient preferences. It is unclear how patients deliberate their choices between different aspects of targeted therapy, including cost, efficacy, and adverse events. Since discrete choice experiments (DCEs) have been widely applied to patient preference elicitation, we reviewed DCEs on targeted therapy for different cancers. We also synthesized evidence on the factors influencing patients' choices and their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for survival when treated by targeted therapy. METHODS: We searched databases, including PubMed, EMBASE and MEDLINE, up to August 16, 2022, supplemented by a reference screening. The attributes from the selected studies were categorized into three groups: outcomes, costs, and process. We also calculated the relative importance of attributes and WTP for survival whenever possible. The purpose, respondents, explanation, findings, significance (PREFS) checklist was used to evaluate the quality of the included DCE studies. RESULTS: The review identified 34 eligible studies from 13 countries covering 14 cancers, such as breast, ovarian, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers. It also reveals a rising trend of DCEs on this topic, as most studies were published after 2018. We found that patients placed higher weights on the outcome (e.g., overall survival) and cost attributes than on process attributes. On average, patients were willing to pay $561 (95% confidence interval [CI]: $415-$758) and $716 (95% CI $524-$958) out-of-pocket for a 1-month increase in progression-free survival and overall survival, respectively. PREFS scores of the 34 studies ranged from 2 to 4, with a mean of 3.38 (SD: 0.65), suggesting a reasonable quality based on the checklist. However, most studies (n = 32, 94%) did not assess the impact of non-responses on the results. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first systematic review focusing on patient preferences for targeted cancer therapy. We showcased novel approaches for evidence synthesis of DCE results, especially the attribute relative importance and WTP. The results may inform stakeholders about patient preferences toward targeted therapy and their WTP estimates. More studies with improved study design and quality are warranted to generate more robust evidence to assist decision making.",2023,Jan,Pharmacoeconomics,41,1,43-57,,10.1007/s40273-022-01198-8,36372823,#1641,Jiang 2023,,,1
Understanding depression treatment and perinatal service preferences of Kenyan pregnant adolescents: A discrete choice experiment.,Kumar M; Tele A; Kathono J; Nyongesa V; Yator O; Mwaniga S; Huang KY; McKay M; Lai J; Levy M; Cuijpers P; Quaife M; Unutzer J,"BACKGROUND: Understanding mental health treatment preferences of adolescents and youth is particularly important for interventions to be acceptable and successful. Person-centered care mandates empowering individuals to take charge of their own health rather than being passive recipients of services. METHODS: We conducted a discrete choice experiment to quantitatively measure adolescent treatment preferences for different care characteristics and explore tradeoffs between these. A total of 153 pregnant adolescents were recruited from two primary healthcare facilities in the informal urban settlement of Nairobi. We selected eight attributes of depression treatment option models drawn from literature review and previous qualitative work. Bayesian d-efficient design was used to identify main effects. A total of ten choice tasks were solicited per respondent. We evaluated mean preferences using mixed logit models to adjust for within subject correlation and account for unobserved heterogeneity. RESULTS: Respondents showed a positive preference that caregivers be provided with information sheets, as opposed to co-participation with caregivers. With regards to treatment options, the respondents showed a positive preference for 8 sessions as compared to 4 sessions. With regards to intervention delivery agents, the respondents had a positive preference for facility nurses as compared to community health volunteers. In terms of support, the respondents showed positive preference for parenting skills as compared to peer support. Our respondents expressed negative preferences of ANC service combined with older mothers as compared to adolescent friendly services and of being offered refreshments alone. A positive preference was revealed for combined refreshments and travel allowance over travel allowance or refreshments alone. A number of these suggestions were about enhancing their experience of maternity clinical care experience. CONCLUSION: This study highlights unique needs of this population. Pregnant adolescents' value responsive maternity and depression care services offered by nurses. Participants shared preference for longer psychotherapy sessions and their preference was to have adolescent centered maternal mental health and child health services within primary care.",2023,,PLoS One,18,3,e0273274,,10.1371/journal.pone.0273274,36888596,#1418,Kumar 2023,,,1
US Residents' Preferences for Sharing of Electronic Health Record and Genetic Information: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,Wagner AL; Zhang F; Ryan KA; Xing E; Nong P; Kardia SLR; Platt J,"OBJECTIVES: The aim to this study was to assess preferences for sharing of electronic health record (EHR) and genetic information separately and to examine whether there are different preferences for sharing these 2 types of information. METHODS: Using a population-based, nationally representative survey of the United States, we conducted a discrete choice experiment in which half of the subjects (N = 790) responded to questions about sharing of genetic information and the other half (N = 751) to questions about sharing of EHR information. Conditional logistic regression models assessed relative preferences across attribute levels of where patients learn about health information sharing, whether shared data are deidentified, whether data are commercialized, how long biospecimens are kept, and what the purpose of sharing the information is. RESULTS: Individuals had strong preferences to share deidentified (vs identified) data (odds ratio [OR] 3.26, 95% confidence interval 2.68-3.96) and to be able to opt out of sharing information with commercial companies (OR 4.26, 95% confidence interval 3.42-5.30). There were no significant differences regarding how long biospecimens are kept or why the data are being shared. Individuals had a stronger preference for opting out of sharing genetic (OR 4.26) versus EHR information (OR 2.64) (P = .002).

Primary and Specialist Palliative Care in Neurosurgery: A Narrative Review and Bibliometric Analysis of Glioblastoma and Stroke.,Harrison DJ; Wu E; Singh R; Ghaith S; Suarez-Meade P; Brown NJ; Sherman WJ; Robinson MT; Lin MP; Lawton MT; Quinones-Hinojosa A,"OBJECTIVE: Due to the increased demand for palliative care (PC) in recent years, a model has been proposed to divide PC into primary PC and specialist PC. This article aimed to delineate the indications for primary and specialist PC within 2 common neurosurgical conditions-glioblastoma (GBM) and stroke. METHODS: A systematic review and bibliometric analysis was conducted to better appreciate the practice trends in PC utilization for GBM and stroke patients using several databases. RESULTS: There were 70 studies on PC for GBM, the majority of which related to patient preference (22 [31%]). During 1999-2022, there was significant growth in publications per year on this topic at a rate of approximately 0.3 publications per year (P < 0.01). There were 44 studies on PC for stroke, the majority of which related to communication strategies (14 [32%]). During 1999-2022, there was no significant growth in stroke publications per year (P = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: Due to the progressively disabling neurological course of GBM, we suggest that a specialty PC team be used in conjunction with the neurosurgical team early in the disease trajectory while patients are still able to communicate their preferences, goals, and values. In contrast, short-term and long-term stages of management of stroke have differing implications for PC needs, with the short-term stage necessitating adept, time-sensitive communication between the patient, family, and care teams. Thus, we propose that primary PC should be included as a core competency in neurosurgery training, among other stroke specialists.",2023,Dec,World Neurosurg,180,,e250-e257,,10.1016/j.wneu.2023.09.048,37739173,#621,Harrison 2023,,,0
Fix or Replace? Patient Preferences for the Treatment of Geriatric Lower Extremity Fractures: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,Richards JT; O'Hara NN; Healy K; Zingas N; McKibben N; Benzel C; Slobogean GP; O'Toole RV; Sciadini MF,"INTRODUCTION: When considering treatment options for geriatric patients with lower extremity fractures, little is known about which outcomes are prioritized by patients. This study aimed to determine the patient preferences for outcomes after a geriatric lower extremity fracture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We administered a discrete choice experiment survey to 150 patients who were at least 60 years of age and treated for a lower extremity fracture at a Level I trauma center. The discrete choice experiment presented study participants with 8 sets of hypothetical outcome comparisons, including joint preservation (yes or no), risk of reoperation at 6 months and 24 months, postoperative weightbearing status, disposition, and function as measured by return to baseline walking distance. We estimated the relative importance of these potential outcomes using multinomial logit modeling. RESULTS: The strongest patient preference was for maintained function after treatment (59%, P < .001), followed by reoperation within 6 months (12%, P < .001). Although patients generally favored joint preservation, patients were willing to change their preference in favor of joint replacement if it increased function (walking distance) by 13% (SE, 66%). Reducing the short-term reoperation risk (12%, P < .001) was more important to patients than reducing long-term reoperation risk (4%, P = .33). Disposition and weightbearing status were lesser priorities to patients (9%, P < .001 and 7%, P < .001, respectively). DISCUSSION: After a lower extremity fracture, geriatric patients prioritized maintained walking function. Avoiding short-term reoperation was more important than avoiding long-term reoperation. Joint preservation through fracture fixation was the preferred treatment of geriatric patients unless arthroplasty or arthrodesis provides a meaningful functional benefit. Hospital disposition and postoperative weightbearing status were less important to patients than the other included outcomes.

Approach to the Patient with Type 2 Diabetes Requiring Add-On Medication.,Baum HBA,"In the last 20 years, the number of approved agents and agent classes for management of type 2 diabetes has expanded significantly. This more robust armamentarium affords us the opportunity to utilize drugs with complementary modes of action to address progressive hyperglycemia as insulin secretion declines over time. Furthermore, some of these agents provide additional benefits, such as weight loss, prevention of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), and protection against declining renal function. This dramatic increase of treatment options has led to complex published treatment advice which may be challenging for the busy clinician. A critical element in medication selection is awareness of the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) lowering potency of the agent being considered, and the distance of the patient's HbA1c from the individualized goal. Other important factors in choosing medication as diabetes progresses include the recognition that there is a diminishing return of glucose-lowering efficacy as add-on agents are introduced, and that the extent of benefit for cardiac and renal protection is not fully understood. In addition, the availability of newer non-insulin agents may distract the clinician from utilizing insulin, the most potent agent available. This goal of this article is to provide a straightforward approach to add-on medication in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, recognizing the limits of polypharmacy and the importance of employing agents best suited to achieving treatment targets. Proposed is a practical tool which provides stepwise guidance, utilizing available data on medication efficacy, while allowing flexibility based on clinician and patient preference.",2024,Feb,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,,,,,10.1210/clinem/dgae056,38373247,#359,BaumHBA 2024,,,0
Lessons Learned from Telemonitoring in an Outpatient Bariatric Surgery Pathway-Secondary Outcomes of a Patient Preference Clinical Trial.,van Ede ES; Scheerhoorn J; Schonck FMJF; van der Stam JA; Buise MP; Nienhuijs SW; Bouwman RA,"BACKGROUND: Remote monitoring is increasingly used to support postoperative care. This study aimed to describe the lessons learned from the use of telemonitoring in an outpatient bariatric surgery pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were assigned based on their preference to an intervention cohort of same-day discharge after bariatric surgery. In total, 102 patients were monitored continuously for 7 days using a wearable monitoring device with a Continuous and Remote Early Warning Score-based notification protocol (CREWS). Outcome measures included missing data, course of postoperative heart and respiration rate, false positive notification and specificity analysis, and vital sign assessment during teleconsultation. RESULTS: In 14.7% of the patients, data for heart rate was missing for > 8 h. A day-night-rhythm of heart rate and respiration rate reappeared on average on postoperative day 2 with heart rate amplitude increasing after day 3. CREWS notification had a specificity of 98%. Of the 17 notifications, 70% was false positive. Half of them occurred between day 4 and 7 and were accompanied with surrounding reassuring values. Comparable postoperative complaints were encountered between patients with normal and deviated data. CONCLUSION: Telemonitoring after outpatient bariatric surgery is feasible. It supports clinical decisions, however does not replace nurse or physician care. Although infrequent, the false notification rate was high. We suggested additional contact may not be necessary when notifications occur after restoration of circadian rhythm or when surrounding reassuring vital signs are present. CREWS supports ruling out serious complications, what may reduce in-hospital re-evaluations. Following these lessons learned, increased patients' comfort and decreased clinical workload could be expected. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov.

"Cardio4Health Study, a Cardiac Telerehabilitation Pilot Program Aimed at Patients After an Ischemic Event: Cross-sectional Study.",Calvo-López M; Arranz Tolós R; Marin Expósito J; Gruosso D; Andrea R; Roque M; Falces C; Yago G; Saura Araguas J; Pastor N; Sitges M; Sanz-de la Garza M,"BACKGROUND: Center-based cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRPs) reduce morbidity and mortality after an ischemic cardiac event; however, they are widely underused. Home-based CRP has emerged as an alternative to improve patient adherence; however, its safety and efficacy remain unclear, especially for older patients and female patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a holistic home-based CRP for patients with ischemic heart disease and evaluate its safety and impact on functional capacity, adherence to a healthy lifestyle, and quality of life. METHODS: The 8-week home-based CRP included patients of both sexes, with no age limit, who had overcome an acute myocardial infarction in the previous 3 months, had a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≥40%, and had access to a tablet or mobile device. The CRP was developed using a dedicated platform designed explicitly for this purpose and included 3 weekly exercise sessions combining tailored aerobic and strength training and 2 weekly educational session focused on lifestyle habits, therapeutic adherence, and patient empowerment. RESULTS: We initially included 62 patients, of whom 1 was excluded for presenting with ventricular arrhythmias during the initial stress test, 5 were excluded because of incompatibility, and 6 dropped out because of a technological barrier. Ultimately, 50 patients completed the program: 85% (42/50) were male, with a mean age of 58.9 (SD 10.3) years, a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 52.1% (SD 6.72%), and 25 (50%) New York Heart Association functional class I and 25 (50%) New York Heart Association II-III. The CRP significantly improved functional capacity (+1.6 metabolic equivalent tasks), muscle strength (arm curl test +15.5% and sit-to-stand test +19.7%), weekly training volume (+803 metabolic equivalent tasks), adherence to the Mediterranean diet, emotional state (anxiety), and quality of life. No major complications occurred, and adherence was excellent (>80%) in both the exercise and educational sessions. In the subgroup analysis, CRP showed equivalent beneficial effects irrespective of sex and age. In addition, patient preferences for CRP approaches were equally distributed, with one-third (14/50, 29%) of the patients preferring a face-to-face CRP, one-third (17/50, 34%) preferring a telematic CRP, and one-third (18/50, 37%) preferring a hybrid approach. Regarding CRP duration, 63% (31/50) of the patients considered it adequate, whereas the remaining 37% (19/50) preferred a longer program. CONCLUSIONS: A holistic telematic CRP dedicated to patients after an ischemic cardiac event, irrespective of sex and age, is safe and, in our population, has achieved positive results in improving maximal aerobic capacity, weekly training volume, muscle strength, quality of life, compliance with diet, and anxiety symptoms. The preference for a center- or home-based CRP approach is diverse among the study population, emphasizing the need for a tailored CRP to improve adherence and completion rates.",2023,Apr,JMIR Cardio,7,,e44179,,10.2196/44179,37093637,#1315,Calvo-López 2023,,,0
Nonpharmacologic and Pharmacologic Treatments of Adults in the Acute Phase of Major Depressive Disorder: A Living Clinical Guideline From the American College of Physicians.,Qaseem A; Owens DK; Etxeandia-Ikobaltzeta I; Tufte J; Cross JT Jr; Wilt TJ; Crandall CJ; Balk E; Cooney TG; Fitterman N; Hicks LA; Lin JS; Maroto M; Obley AJ; Tice JA; Yost J,"DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this guideline from the American College of Physicians (ACP) is to present updated clinical recommendations on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions as initial and second-line treatments during the acute phase of a major depressive disorder (MDD) episode, based on the best available evidence on the comparative benefits and harms, consideration of patient values and preferences, and cost. METHODS: The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on an updated systematic review of the evidence. AUDIENCE AND PATIENT POPULATION: The audience for this guideline includes clinicians caring for adult patients in the acute phase of MDD in ambulatory care. The patient population includes adults in the acute phase of MDD. RECOMMENDATION 1A: ACP recommends monotherapy with either cognitive behavioral therapy or a second-generation antidepressant as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder (strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence). RECOMMENDATION 1B: ACP suggests combination therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy and a second-generation antidepressant as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The informed decision on the options of monotherapy with cognitive behavioral therapy versus second-generation antidepressants or combination therapy should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences. RECOMMENDATION 2: ACP suggests monotherapy with cognitive behavioral therapy as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of mild major depressive disorder (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). RECOMMENDATION 3: ACP suggests one of the following options for patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder who did not respond to initial treatment with an adequate dose of a second-generation antidepressant: • Switching to or augmenting with cognitive behavioral therapy (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence) • Switching to a different second-generation antidepressant or augmenting with a second pharmacologic treatment (see Clinical Considerations) (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence) The informed decision on the options should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences.",2023,Feb,Ann Intern Med,176,2,239-252,,10.7326/M22-2056,36689752,#1539,Qaseem 2023,,,0
Improving Hands-Free Speech Rehabilitation in Laryngectomized Patients with a Moldable Adhesive.,Leemans M; Longobardi Y; Dirven R; Honings J; D'Alatri L; Galli J; van den Brekel M; Parrilla C; van Sluis KE,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the product performance of a new moldable peristomal adhesive with corresponding heating pad designed to facilitate and improve automatic speaking valve (ASV) fixation for hands-free speech in laryngectomized patients. METHODS: Twenty laryngectomized patients, all regular adhesive users with prior ASV experience, were included. Study-specific questionnaires were used for data collection at baseline and after two weeks of moldable adhesive use. The primary outcome parameters were adhesive lifetime during hands-free speech, use and duration of hands-free speech, and patient preference. Additional outcome parameters were satisfaction, comfort, fit, and usability. RESULTS: The moldable adhesive enabled ASV fixation adequate for hands-free speech in the majority of participants. Overall, the moldable adhesive significantly increased adhesive lifetime and duration of hands-free speech compared to participants' baseline adhesives (p < 0.05), regardless of stoma depth, skin irritation, or regular use of hands-free speech at baseline. The participants who preferred the moldable adhesive (55% of participants) experienced a significant increase in the adhesive lifetime (median of 24 h, range 8-144 h) and improved comfort, fit, and ease of speech. CONCLUSION: The moldable adhesive's lifetime and functional aspects, including the ease of use and custom fit, are encouraging outcomes and enable more laryngectomized patients to use hands-free speech more regularly.

The Rhytidectomy Scar: Analysis of Patient and Surgeon Perspectives.,Kumar AR; Lu GN; Lee E; Kontis TC,"An understanding of patient preference is vital for surgeons to create outcomes that align with the goals of patients undergoing cosmetic surgery. This study analyzes the perception of the rhytidectomy scar from the perspective of cosmetic patients and surgeons. Cross-sectional surveys were administered in-person to cosmetic patients and online to facial plastic and reconstructive surgeons in the United States. Participants were presented with standardized lateral view photographs of preauricular scars for 10 patients at least 12 months post rhytidectomy procedure. A variety of rhytidectomy incisions were chosen to include pre- versus post-tragal incisions, blunted hair tuft, hypopigmentation, narrow versus wide scar healing. Participants were asked to rate the outcome of the preauricular rhytidectomy scar using the Likert scale from 1 to 10. Quantitative analysis indicates that while both surgeons and cosmetic patients viewed hypopigmented scars less favorably, surgeons were more concerned with pre-tragal incision and blunted hair tuft. Furthermore, the number of rhytidectomies performed by surgeons resulted in more critical analysis of the scars presented in this study. Qualitative analysis of the frequent use of ""natural"" in the patient comments suggests the importance of maintaining a sense of ""normalcy"" as well. In contrast, the surgeon comments are most frequently about the relationship between the scar and surrounding anatomical structures, suggesting a descriptive focus on the technicality of scar placement and subsequent anatomical result. Cosmetic patients are primarily concerned about scar appearance while surgeons are more focused on the technical orientation of the scar. An understanding and comparison of the language and perceptions of surgeons and cosmetic patients regarding rhytidectomy scars are vital in creating aesthetic results and managing patient expectations.",2023,Apr,Facial Plast Surg,39,2,105-109,,10.1055/s-0042-1749183,35750195,#1382,Kumar 2023,,,0
"A Randomized, Open-label, Cross-over Phase 2 Trial of Darolutamide and Enzalutamide in Men with Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic Metastatic Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer: Patient Preference and Cognitive Function in ODENZA.",Colomba E; Jonas SF; Eymard JC; Delva R; Brachet PE; Neuzillet Y; Penel N; Roubaud G; Bompas E; Mahammedi H; Longo R; Helissey C; Barthélemy P; Borchiellini D; Hasbini A; Priou F; Saldana C; Voog E; Narcisso B; Ladoire S; Berdah JF; Aisenfarb JB; Foulon S; Fizazi K,"BACKGROUND: Darolutamide and enzalutamide are second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors with activity in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and different toxicity profiles. OBJECTIVE: ODENZA is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, cross-over, phase 2 trial designed to assess preference between darolutamide and enzalutamide in men with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC (mCRPC). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either darolutamide 1200 mg/d for 12 wk followed by enzalutamide 160 mg/d for 12 wk or enzalutamide followed by darolutamide. In both arms, the second treatment was given in absence of cancer progression. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was patient preference between the two drugs, as assessed by a preference questionnaire (p value calculated with the Prescott test). After week 24, patients entered an extension period during which they received their preferred treatment until progression or toxicity. The main secondary objectives included reasons for patient preference, response at week 12, tolerance of each drug, and measurement compared with baseline of cognitive outcomes assessed using tablet questionnaires. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 249 patients, with a median age of 72 yr, were randomized. Among the 200 patients who fulfilled the preplanned criteria for the evaluation of the primary endpoint of preference, 97 (49% [41; 56]), 80 (40% [33; 47]), and 23 (12% [7; 16]) chose darolutamide, chose enzalutamide, and had no preference, respectively (p = 0.92). Reduced fatigue, easier administration, and better quality of life were the main criteria that influenced patient choice. A moderate benefit in episodic memory from darolutamide was observed for the acquisition of new information (least square [LS] means difference = 2.2, effect size = 0.5) and for the recall of that information after a brief delay (LS means difference = 0.7, effect size = 0.3). Using the Brief Fatigue Inventory questionnaire, patients reported greater fatigue with enzalutamide (3.3 [3.0; 3.6]) than with darolutamide (2.7 [2.4; 3.0]). There was no difference in terms of depression, seizures, and falls. CONCLUSIONS: The study did not show a difference in preference between the two treatments. In men with mCRPC, darolutamide was associated with a clinically meaningful benefit in episodic memory and less fatigue compared with enzalutamide. PATIENT SUMMARY: Preference between darolutamide and enzalutamide was well balanced in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Darolutamide was associated with a significant benefit in verbal learning and less fatigue compared with enzalutamide.",2024,Mar,Eur Urol,85,3,274-282,,10.1016/j.eururo.2023.05.009,37271630,#323,Colomba 2024,,,0
Barriers to Optimal Clinician Guideline Adherence in the Management of Markedly Elevated Blood Pressure: A Qualitative Content Analysis of Electronic Health Records.,Lu Y; Arowojolu O; Qiu X; Liu Y; Curry L; Krumholz HM,"IMPORTANCE: Hypertension poses a significant public health challenge. Despite clinical practice guidelines for hypertension management, clinician adherence to these guidelines remains suboptimal. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a taxonomy of suboptimal adherence scenarios for severe hypertension and identify barriers to guideline adherence. DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative content analysis using electronic health records (EHRs) of Yale New Haven Health System who had at least two consecutive visits between January 1, 2013, and October 31, 2018. SETTING: This was a thematic analysis of EHR data to generate a real-world taxonomy of scenarios of suboptimal clinician guideline adherence in the management of severe hypertension. PARTICIPANTS: We identified patients with markedly elevated blood pressure ([BP]; defined as at least 2 consecutive readings of BP ≥160/100 mmHg) and no prescription for antihypertensive medication within a 90-day of the 2(nd) BP elevation (n=4,828). We randomly selected 100 records from the group of all eligible patients for qualitative analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The scenarios and influencing factors contributing to clinician non-adherence to the guidelines for hypertension management. RESULTS: Thematic saturation was reached after analyzing 100 patient records. Three content domains emerged: clinician-related scenarios (neglect and diffusion of responsibility), patient-related scenarios (patient non-adherence and patient preference), and clinical complexity-related scenarios (diagnostic uncertainty, maintenance of current intervention and competing medical priorities). Through a metareview of literature, we identified several plausible influencing factors, including a lack of protocols and processes that clearly define the roles within the institution to implement guidelines, infrastructure limitations, and clinicians' lack of autonomy and authority, excessive workload, time constraints, clinician belief that intervention was not part of their role, or perception that guidelines restrict clinical judgment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study illuminates reasons for suboptimal adherence to guidelines for managing markedly elevated BP. The taxonomy of suboptimal adherence scenarios, derived from real-world EHR data, is pragmatic and provides a basis for developing targeted interventions to improve clinician guideline adherence and patient outcomes.",2024,Jan,medRxiv,,,,,10.1101/2024.01.12.24301223,38260693,#473,Lu 2024,,,0
Multidisciplinary Guidelines for the Rational Use of Topical Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs for Musculoskeletal Pain (2022).,Shi C; Ye Z; Shao Z; Fan B; Huang C; Zhang Y; Kuang X; Miao L; Wu X; Zhao R; Chen X; Zhang B; Tong R; Hu X; Fu Z; Lin J; Li X; Sun T; Liu G; Dai H; Guo C; Xu T; Wen A; Zuo X; Liu J; Li H; Wang J; Luo M; Fan T; Qian Y; Qiu W; Lin X; Pang Y; Hou Y; Yao D; Kou W; Sun B; Hu C; Xia Y; Zhao M; Zhu C; Li Q,"(1) Background: Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the primary drugs for treating musculoskeletal pain. However, there are currently no evidence-based recommendations about drug selection, drug administration, drug interactions, and use in special populations or other pharmacology-related content of such medications. To this end, the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association Hospital Pharmacy Professional Committee developed multidisciplinary guidelines on using topical NSAIDs to treat musculoskeletal pain. (2) Methods: The guidelines development process followed the World Health Organization guideline development handbook, the GRADE methodology, and the statement of Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare. The guideline panel used the Delphi method to identify six clinical questions to be addressed in the guidelines. An independent systematic review team conducted a systematic search and integration of evidence. (3) Results: Based on the balance between the benefits and harms of an intervention, the quality of the evidence, patient preferences and values, and resource utilization, the guideline panel developed 11 recommendations and nine expert consensuses on using topical NSAIDs to treat acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain. (4) Conclusions: Based on the effectiveness and overall safety of topical NSAIDs, we recommend patients with musculoskeletal pain use topical NSAIDs and suggest high-risk patients use topical NSAIDs, such as those with other diseases or receiving other concurrent treatments. The evidenced-based guidelines on topical NSAIDs for musculoskeletal pain incorporated a pharmacist perspective. The guidelines have the potential to facilitate the rational use of topical NSAIDs. The guideline panel will monitor the relevant evidence and update the recommendations accordingly.",2023,Feb,J Clin Med,12,4,,,10.3390/jcm12041544,36836078,#1515,Shi 2023,,,0
Patients' choice preferences for specialist outpatient online consultations: A discrete choice experiment.,Wu M; Li Y; Ma C,"BACKGROUND: Internet hospitals are multiplying with solid support from the Chinese government. In internet hospitals, specialist outpatient online consultations (SOOC) are the primary services. However, the acceptance and utilization rates of this service are still low. Thus, the study of patients' choice preferences for SOOC is needed. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the choice preference of patients' SOOC via a discrete choice experiment, understand the influence of each factor and promote the development of internet hospitals. METHODS: Via a discrete selection experiment, a total of 162 patients from two general hospitals and three specialized hospitals in Beijing were selected for the questionnaire survey. The choice preferences were analyzed by conditional logit regression. RESULTS: From high to low, patients' willingness to pay (WTP) for the attributes of SOOC is as follows: doctors' recommendation rate (β (highly recommend) = 0.999), the convenience of applying SOOC services (β (Convenient) = 0.760), the increasing ratio of medical insurance payment for online services compared to offline (β (Increase by 10%) = 0.545), and the disease's severity (β (severe) = -3.024). The results of the subgroup analysis showed differences in patient choice preference by age, whether the patients had chronic diseases, income, and medical insurance types. CONCLUSION: Both price and nonprice attributes influence the choice preference of SOOC for patients. Among them, patients are more inclined to choose SOOC when doctors highly recommend it, when it is convenient to apply, when medical insurance increases by 10%, and when disease severity is mild. The current findings show the government and medical institutions formulate auxiliary policies and welfare strategies by clarifying core attributes and adjusting the levels of different attributes to improve patients' acceptance of SOOC. The utility of SOOC and the further development of internet hospitals are radically promoted.",2022,,Front Public Health,10,,1075146,,10.3389/fpubh.2022.1075146,36684861,#1600,Wu 2022,,,1
Method for Calculating the Simultaneous Maximum Acceptable Risk Threshold (SMART) from Discrete-Choice Experiment Benefit-Risk Studies.,Fairchild AO; Reed SD; Gonzalez JM,"BACKGROUND: Medical decisions require weighing expected benefits of treatment against multiple adverse outcomes under uncertainty (i.e., risks) that must be accepted as a bundle. However, conventional maximum acceptable risk (MAR) estimates derived from discrete-choice experiment benefit-risk studies evaluate the acceptance of individual risks, assuming other risks are fixed, potentially leading decision makers to misinterpret levels of risk acceptance. DESIGN: Using simulations and a published discrete-choice experiment, we demonstrate a method for identifying multidimensional risk-tolerance measures given a treatment level of benefit. RESULTS: Simultaneous Maximum Acceptable Risk Thresholds (SMART) represents combinations of risks that would be jointly accepted in exchange for specific treatment benefits. The framework shows how the expectation of utility associated with treatments that involve multiple risks are related even when preferences for potential adverse events are independent. We find that the form of the marginal effects of adverse-event probabilities on the expected utility of treatment determines the magnitude of differences between SMART and conventional single-outcome MAR estimates. LIMITATIONS: Preferences for potential adverse events not considered in a study or preferences for adverse-event attributes held constant in risk-tolerance calculations may affect estimated risk tolerance. Further research is needed to understand the right balance between realistically reflecting clinical treatments with many potential adverse events and the cognitive burden of evaluating risk-risk tradeoffs in research and in practice. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: SMART analysis should be considered in preference studies evaluating the joint acceptance of multiple potential adverse events. HIGHLIGHTS: Conventional approaches to calculate maximum-acceptable risk (MAR) using discrete-choice experiment data account for 1 adverse-event risk at a time, requiring that decision makers infer the acceptability of treatments when patients are exposed to multiple risks simultaneously.The Simultaneous Maximum Acceptable Risk Threshold (SMART) maps combinations of adverse-event risks that would be jointly acceptable given a specific treatment benefit and provides a transparent and precise portrayal of acceptance of multiple risks.Risk levels that would be accepted using individual MAR estimates might not be acceptable when simultaneous risks are considered, especially when marginal expected disutility of risk is decreasing nonlinearly with risk probabilities.Preference researchers should calculate SMARTs in any discrete-choice study in which 2 or more adverse-event risks are presented, particularly if risk preferences are nonlinear.",2023,Feb,Med Decis Making,43,2,227-238,,10.1177/0272989X221132266,36326189,#1559,Fairchild 2023,,,1

Patient perceptions and experiences with medication-related activities in the emergency department: a qualitative study.,Zahl-Holmstad B; Garcia BH; Johnsgård T; Ofstad EH; Lehnbom EC; Svendsen K; Risør T; Holis RV; Elenjord R,"BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED) pharmacists reduce medication errors and improve quality of medication use. Patient perceptions and experiences with ED pharmacists have not been studied. The aim of this study was to explore patients' perceptions of and experiences with medication-related activities in the ED, with and without an ED pharmacist present. METHODS: We conducted 24 semistructured individual interviews with patients admitted to one ED in Norway, 12 before and 12 during an intervention, where pharmacists performed medication-related tasks close to patients and in collaboration with ED staff. Interviews were transcribed and analysed applying thematic analysis. RESULTS: From our five developed themes, we identified that: (1) Our informants had low awareness and few expectations of the ED pharmacist, both with and without the pharmacist present. However, they were positive to the ED pharmacist. (2) Our informants expressed a variation of trust in the healthcare system, healthcare professionals and electronic systems, though the majority expressed a high level of trust. They believed that their medication list was automatically updated and assumed to get the correct medication. (3) Some informants felt responsible to have an overview of their medication use, while others expressed low interest in taking responsibility regarding their medication. (4) Some informants did not want involvement from healthcare professionals in medication administration, while others expressed no problems with giving up control. (5) Medication information was important for all informants to feel confident in medication use, but the need for information differed. CONCLUSION: Despite being positive to pharmacists, it did not seem important to our informants who performed the medication-related tasks, as long as they received the help they needed. The degree of trust, responsibility, control and information varied among ED patients. These dimensions can be applied by healthcare professionals to tailor medication-related activities to patients' individual needs.",2023,May,BMJ Open Qual,12,2,,,10.1136/bmjoq-2022-002239,37217242,#1258,Zahl-Holmstad 2023,,,0
Preferences of People Living with HIV for Long-Acting Antiretroviral Treatment in Germany: Evidence from a Discrete Choice Experiment.,Emmert M; Rohrbacher S; Jahn J; Fernando K; Lauerer M,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elicit preferences for attributes of current and novel long-acting antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus treatment. METHODS: Primary survey data were collected (July-October 2022) on a sample of 333 people living with human immunodeficiency virus in Germany from a patient recruitment agency. Respondents were invited by e-mail to respond to a web-based questionnaire. After performing a systematic literature review, we conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews to identify and select the key attributes of drug therapy for patients' preferences for human immunodeficiency virus treatment. Based on this, a discrete choice experiment survey elicited preferences for long-acting antiretroviral therapy characteristics, including the type of medication, frequency of dosing, the location of treatment, the risk of both short-term and long-term side effects, as well as possible interactions with other medications or (party) drugs. A statistical data analysis was performed using multinomial logit models. An additional latent class multinomial logit was performed to evaluate subgroup differences. RESULTS: Overall, 226 respondents (86% male, mean age 46.1 years) were included in the analysis. The frequency of dosing (36.1%) and the risk of long-term side effects (28.2%) had the greatest influence on preferences. The latent class analysis identified two patient groups. While the first class (n = 135; 87% male, mean age 44.4 years) found the frequency of dosing (44.1%) to be most important, the second class (n = 91; 85% male, mean age 48.6 years) focused on the risk of long-term side effects (50.3%). The evaluation of structural variables showed that male respondents, those living in small cities or villages, and those with better health status results were significantly more likely to be assigned to the second class (p < 0.05 each). CONCLUSIONS: All attributes included in our survey were important to participants when choosing an antiretroviral therapy. We found evidence that the frequency of dosing as well as the risk of long-term side effects have a particular impact on the acceptance of novel therapy regimens and should be considered in order to optimize adherence and satisfaction.",2023,Sep,Patient,16,5,537-553,,10.1007/s40271-023-00641-y,37436659,#919,Emmert 2023,,,1
Patient and clinician perspectives of information needs concerning oral epithelial dysplasia.,Alsoghier A; Riordain RN; Fedele S; Porter S,"OBJECTIVES: Individuals diagnosed with a chronic oral disease that increase the risk of mouth cancer, such as oral epithelial dysplasia (OED), require appropriate knowledge to make informed decisions. The present study aimed to assess whether patient information needs of a group of patients concerning dysplasia were met and to what degree clinicians agree with patients on 'important' topics. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This represented secondary analyses of a cross-sectional study to assess the information needs of 86 patients diagnosed with dysplasia compared with those of 77 clinicians using the validated OED Information Needs Questionnaire. Descriptive, concordance and regression analyses were performed for the collected data. RESULTS: The mean and median total scores for all items in the amount of information received subscale were 2.33 and 2.44, indicating overall unmet needs concerning dysplasia. Clinicians were generally able to predict topics of greatest importance to patients, although their scores were mainly lower than those of patients (k = 0.06). There was a higher agreement between patients (k = 0.25) than clinicians (k = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Clinicians are encouraged to assess a patient's information needs to ensure tailored and patient-centred communication concerning OED during all clinical consultations.",2023,Jul,Oral Dis,,,,,10.1111/odi.14668,37455497,#1058,Alsoghier 2023,,,0
"Treatment preferences of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France, and Spain: results from a discrete choice experiment.",Thomas C; Ailawadhi S; Popat R; Kleinman D; Ross MM; Gorsh B; Mulnick S; O'Neill A; Paka P; Hanna M; Krucien N; Molinari A; Gelhorn HL; Perera S,"INTRODUCTION: Newer treatment options for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) with efficacy and safety profiles that differ from traditional therapies have facilitated personalized management strategies to optimize patient outcomes. In the context of such personalized management, understanding how treatment characteristics influence patients' preferences is essential. This study assessed patients' preferences for RRMM treatment attributes and determined trade-offs between potential benefits, administration procedures, and adverse effects. METHODS: Patients' preferences were evaluated using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Patients with RRMM who reported failing two lines of anti-myeloma treatment (immunomodulatory agent and a proteasome inhibitor [PI]) or ≥ 3 lines (including ≥1 PI, immunomodulatory agent, or anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody), were recruited across the US, UK, Italy, Germany, France, and Spain. DCE attributes and levels were identified using a targeted literature review, a review of clinical data for relevant RRMM treatments, qualitative patient interviews, and input from clinical and myeloma patient experts. The DCE was administered within an online survey from February-June 2022. Preference data were analyzed using an error-component logit model and willingness to make trade-offs for potential benefits, and relative attribute importance scores were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, 296 patients from the US (n = 100), UK (n = 49), Italy (n = 45), Germany (n = 43), France (n = 39), and Spain (n = 20) participated in the DCE. Mean (standard deviation) age was 63.8 (8.0) years, 84% had a caregiver, and patients had a median of 3 (range: 2-8) prior lines of therapy. Efficacy attributes most influenced patients' preferences, with increasing overall response rate (25-85%) and overall survival (6 months to 2 years) contributing to ~50% of treatment decision-making. Administration procedures were also considered important to patients. Avoiding individual side effects was considered relatively less important, with patients willing to tolerate increases in side effects for gains in efficacy. Patient characteristics such as rate of disease progression, sociodemographics, or clinical characteristics also influenced treatment preferences. CONCLUSION: Patients with RRMM were willing to tolerate increased risk of side effects for higher efficacy. Preferences and risk tolerance varied between patients, with preference patterns differing by certain patient characteristics. This highlights the importance of shared decision-making for optimal treatment selection and patient outcomes.",2023,,Front Med (Lausanne),10,,1271657,,10.3389/fmed.2023.1271657,38076274,#662,Thomas 2023,,,1
"Effectiveness of telehealth-based exercise interventions on pain, physical function and quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis: A meta-analysis.",Yang Y; Li S; Cai Y; Zhang Q; Ge P; Shang S; Han H,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of telehealth-based exercise intervention on pain, physical function and quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Six databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PEDro and Web of Science Core Collection) were searched for relevant randomised controlled trials published from database inception to 3 June 2021. Reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted data and used the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool for quality assessment. A meta-analysis and subgroup analyses, stratified by control condition, intervention duration and delivery type, were conducted by Revman 5.4. The study was reported in compliance with PRISMA statement. RESULTS: A total of 9 independent RCTs with 861 participants were included. The meta-analysis showed that the telehealth-based exercise interventions significantly reduced pain in KOA patients (SMD = -0.28, 95% CI [-0.49, -0.08], p < .01) and produced similar effects to controls in terms of physical function and quality of life. Subgroup analysis revealed that telehealth-based exercise interventions were superior to the use of exercise booklet and usual care in terms of pain and physical function and were similar to face-to-face exercise treatment; a long-term (>3 months) intervention and the use of web and smartphone APPs to deliver exercise interventions were associated with better pain relief and physical function. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth-based exercise intervention is an effective strategy for KOA management during the COVID-19 epidemic, and it is significantly better than usual care in reducing knee pain and improving physical function and was able to achieve the effects of traditional face-to-face exercise treatment. Although the duration and type of delivery associated with the effect of the intervention have been identified, patient preference and acceptability need to be considered in practice.",2023,Jun,J Clin Nurs,32,11-12,2505-2520,,10.1111/jocn.16388,35872635,#1221,Yang 2023,,,0

Interrelationship between dental clinicians and laboratory technicians: a qualitative study.,Ismail EH; Al-Moghrabi D,"BACKGROUND: Effective communication among members of the dental team is essential for the delivery of high-quality dental care. However, an in-depth understanding of issues concerning the interrelationship between dental clinicians and laboratory technicians has not been previously undertaken. Therefore, the aim of the study was to explore factors influencing the interrelationship between dental clinicians and laboratory technicians. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with dental clinicians and laboratory technicians using purposeful snowball sampling. Two trained researchers conducted the interviews based on a pre-piloted topic guide. The interviews were conducted via video conferencing platform, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Field notes were taken during the interviews. Framework Methodology was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 20 dental clinicians and laboratory technicians were interviewed. The average interview duration was 37 min. Participants mainly reported negative encounters and highlighted the importance of training and exposure, collaborative learning, and alignment of expectations of both parties in terms of cost of laboratory work, turnaround time, and patient preferences. The relationship between dental clinicians and laboratory technicians depends largely on effective teamwork dynamics and open communication channels. Increased workload, workforce shortage, availability of digital systems, management policies, and financial challenges were emphasized as organizational factors affecting the interrelationship between both groups. Participants highlighted the importance of shadowing, mentorship, education courses, joint discussions, patient-technician rapport, and adoption of digital technology for fostering collaborative practices between the professions. CONCLUSIONS: A multitude of factors influencing the dental clinician-laboratory interrelationship at individual, interpersonal and organizational levels were identified. This study highlights the need to build a transformative relationship underpinned by mutual trust and respect. Such a collaborative relationship will facilitate optimal patient care and successful treatment outcomes. The outcome of this study can help stakeholders identify solutions for enhancing the interrelationship among the dental team, to ultimately improve patient care and efficiency of dental services.",2023,Sep,BMC Oral Health,23,1,682,,10.1186/s12903-023-03395-z,37730593,#869,Ismail 2023,,,0
Eliciting preferences for cancer screening tests: Comparison of a discrete choice experiment and the threshold technique.,Valentine KD; Shaffer VA; Hauber B,"OBJECTIVE: To compare results of three preference elicitation methods for a cancer screening test. METHODS: Participants (undergraduate students) completed a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and a threshold technique (TT) task. Accuracy (false positives, false negatives), benefits (lives saved), and cost for a cancer screening test were used as attributes in the DCE and branching logic for the TT. Participants were also asked a direct elicitation question regarding a hypothetical screening test for breast (women) or prostate (men) cancer without mortality benefit. Correlations assessed the relationship between DCE and TT thresholds. Thresholds were standardized and ranked for both methods to compare. A logistic regression used the thresholds to predict results of the direct elicitation. RESULTS: DCE and TT estimates were not meaningfully correlated (max ρ = 0.17). Participant rankings of attributes matched only 20% of the time (58/292). Neither method predicted preference for being screened (ps > 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: The DCE and TT yielded different preference estimates (and rank orderings) for the same participant. Neither method predicted patients' desires for a screening test. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians, patients, policy makers, and researchers should be aware that patient preference results may be sensitive to the method of eliciting preferences.",2023,Oct,Patient Educ Couns,115,,107898,,10.1016/j.pec.2023.107898,37467593,#824,Valentine 2023,,,1
Ageism scale for dental students (ASDS): A focus group review of content validity.,Elliott K; Dukes KC; Barlow PB; Kossioni A; Marchini L,"PURPOSE/AIM: Improve content validity of the Ageism Scale for Dental Students (ASDS) and identify barriers to using the scale. METHODS: Thematic analysis of transcripts of three purposively sampled focus groups of 1) geriatric dentistry specialists, 2) older adult dental patients, and 3) dental students. RESULTS: Twenty-five participants engaged in focus groups. No new concepts to define ageism were identified. Experts found the scale acceptable and appropriate, yet they raised specific potential revisions to scale questions. Commonly reported themes already addressed by ASDS included the importance of tailoring decision-making to patient preference and not making assumptions about older adults' capacity or preferences for dental care. Barriers to identifying ageism or using the scale included experiential differences in interpreting scale items, cultural differences in attitudes towards older adults, and potential overlap with social determinants of health. Secondary findings include recommendations for older-adult focused training for dental students to provide positive, concrete guidance on caring for older adults. CONCLUSION: There are opportunities to refine the Ageism Scale for Dental Students and to allow tailoring of the scale for specific national or cultural contexts.",2024,Jan,Spec Care Dentist,,,,,10.1111/scd.12960,38217073,#477,Elliott 2024,,,0
Conceptualizing Person-Centered Care in Elder Mistreatment Intervention: Use of a Well-Being Framework.,Martinez JM; Homeier DC; Fowler C; Wilber KH,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Person-centered care (PCC) applied to elder mistreatment interventions is an approach to include victim priorities. Although PCC may improve outcomes by supporting choice, victim preferences are often difficult to support, especially in high-risk situations. We studied the adaptation of PCC structures and process to a pilot intervention, aimed at including client preferences in a multidisciplinary team's plans to address complex elder mistreatment. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Case study analysis was used to examine the process of integrating client priorities into a risk-reduction plan. A well-being framework was used to understand the relationship between safety and preferences. Purposive sampling identified a case study of a high-risk victim with history of refusing help who agreed to work with the Service Advocate, a member of a multidisciplinary team. RESULTS: PCC required a relationship of trust, honed over several weeks by prioritizing the clients' perspective. Client preferences included remaining at home, continuing the relationship with the abuser, and maintaining a sense of mastery. Individualized definitions of ""safety"" were unrelated to elder mistreatment risk. Assistance included working with the suspected perpetrator, which is not offered by most elder mistreatment interventions, and resulted in some risk reduction. Reasons for refusing help were a desire for control and fear of loss of well-being assets. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Individualized definitions of well-being should be considered in measuring intervention success. Future research could determine guidelines on what levels of elder mistreatment risk are acceptable, and how to monitor clients for safety while supporting autonomy.",2023,Jul,Gerontologist,63,6,973-982,,10.1093/geront/gnac170,36434169,#1054,Martinez 2023,,,0
Preferences for accessing sexual health services among middle-aged and older adults in the UK: a study protocol for a discrete choice experiment using mixed methods.,Kpokiri E; Pan SW; Ong JJ; Greaves E; Khan J; Bowen S; Jannaway T; Terris-Prestholt F; Tanton C; Kuper H; Shakespeare T; Tucker JD; Wu D,"INTRODUCTION: Sexual health is essential for general health and well-being. Sexual health services for middle-aged and older adults are not prioritised and optimising available services for this population is often overlooked. Not much is known about preferences for accessing sexual health services among middle-aged and older people or level of satisfaction with current services. The aim of this study is to explore preferences for seeking sexual health services among middle-aged and older adults in the UK. This study will use discrete choice experiments (DCEs) including initial qualitative interviews followed by the survey, which have been used as a tool to explore preferences in various health service delivery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The project will be carried out in two phases. First, we will conduct in-depth semi-structured interviews with 20-30 adults (aged 45+), including disabled people, and those from sexual minority groups resident in the UK. Interviews will explore indications, preferences and factors related to accessing sexual health services. Themes and subthemes emerging from the analysis of the interviews will then be used to design the choice sets and attribute level for the DCEs. For the second phase, for the DCEs, we will design choice sets composed of sexual health service delivery scenarios. The software Ngene will be used to develop the experimental design matrix for the DCE. We will use descriptive statistics to summarise the key sociodemographic characteristics of the study population. Multinomial logit, latent class and mixed logit models will be explored to assess sexual health service preferences and preference heterogeneity. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for both parts of this study was granted by the Research and Ethics Committee at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Findings from this study will be disseminated widely to relevant stakeholders via scheduled meetings, webinars, presentations and journal publications.",2023,May,BMJ Open,13,5,e066783,,10.1136/bmjopen-2022-066783,37156584,#1247,Kpokiri 2023,,,1
Preference of acromegaly patients for treatment attributes in Spain.,Fajardo C; Álvarez-Escola C; Biagetti B; Garcia-Centeno R; Ciriza R; Sánchez-Cenizo L; Díaz-Muñoz M,"OBJECTIVE: Acromegaly is a rare disease caused by increased growth hormone secretion and a subsequent increase in insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels. Patients display multiple comorbidities that affect their quality of life (QoL). Treatment aims to maintain good biochemical control, tumour control and reduce the risk of comorbidities; however, their impact on QoL has been overlooked until recently. We interviewed patients to explore their preferences with regard to treatment attributes. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study based on interviews and a discrete choice experiment (DCE) in a Spanish cohort. METHODS: Adult patients diagnosed with acromegaly ≥1 year before the start of the study and under treatment were included. Treatment attributes were collected from patient testimony during face-to-face interviews. Then, a DCE was performed to elicit patient preferences for certain treatment attributes. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients completed the study. QoL improvement was the most important treatment attribute (37%), followed by IGF-I control (20%), blood sugar control (17%) and tumour control (13%). Secondary attributes were pain associated with the route of administration (7%), diarrhoea (2%), administration method (2%) and storage conditions (2%). We then calculated the theoretical share of preference for existing treatments, based on the individual preference utility for each attribute and level. Pegvisomant obtained the highest share of preference overall, and the highest preference as a second-line treatment (53 and 95%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: QoL greatly influences patient treatment preference. Since acromegaly patients are informed and aware of their disease, treatment choices should always be shared with patients.",2023,Nov,Endocrine,82,2,379-389,,10.1007/s12020-023-03462-z,37507554,#733,Fajardo 2023,,,1
Primary health care during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative exploration of the challenges and changes in practice experienced by GPs and GP trainees.,Grut M; de Wildt G; Clarke J; Greenfield S; Russell A,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly changed general practice in the UK. Research is required to understand how General Practitioners (GPs) and GP trainees adjusted to these changes, so that beneficial changes might be sustained, and Primary Health Care (PHC) can be prepared for future challenges. This study explored the experiences and perspectives of GP and GP trainees during the pandemic. METHODS: Remote, semi-structured interviews (n = 21) were conducted with GPs (n = 11) and GP trainees (n = 10), recruited from across the UK using convenience and purposive sampling. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interview data were analysed with an inductive thematic approach. RESULTS: Five overarching themes were identified: (1) 'Thrown in at the deep end'; (2) Telemedicine: 'it needs to be a happy balance'; (3) Delayed referrals and 'holding' patients; (4) The Covid Cohort-training in Covid; (5) Suggestions and lessons for the future of general practice'. GPs reported a turbulent and uncertain time of major changes to PHC. They described the benefits of technology in general medicine, particularly telemedicine, when used in a balanced manner, highlighting the need for accompanying teaching and guidelines, and the importance of patient preferences. Key tools to help GPs manage patients with delayed referrals to Secondary Care were also identified. CONCLUSION: Several key changes to general practice occurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including a rapid uptake of telemedicine. The pandemic exposed the strengths and limitations of normal general practice and highlighted the importance of workplace camaraderie. These findings contribute to the evidence base used to adapt PHC infrastructures as we emerge from the pandemic.",2023,,PLoS One,18,2,e0280733,,10.1371/journal.pone.0280733,36758002,#1520,Grut 2023,,,0
Comparative analysis of algorithm-guided treatment and predefined duration treatment programmes for depression: exploring cost-effectiveness using routine care data.,Li F; Visser E; Brilman M; Vries SO; Goeree B; Feenstra T; Jörg F,"BACKGROUND: More knowledge on the cost-effectiveness of various depression treatment programmes can promote efficient treatment allocation and improve the quality of depression care. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the real-world cost-effectiveness of an algorithm-guided programme focused on remission to a predefined duration, patient preference-centred treatment programme focused on response using routine care data. METHODS: A naturalistic study (n=6295 in the raw dataset) was used to compare the costs and outcomes of two programmes in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and depression-free days (DFD). Analyses were performed from a healthcare system perspective over a 2-year time horizon. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated, and the uncertainty of results was assessed using bootstrapping and sensitivity analysis. FINDINGS: The algorithm-guided treatment programme per client yielded more DFDs (12) and more QALYs (0.013) at a higher cost (€3070) than the predefined duration treatment programme. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were around €256/DFD and €236 154/QALY for the algorithm guided compared with the predefined duration treatment programme. At a threshold value of €50 000/QALY gained, the programme had a probability of <10% of being considered cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm-guided programme led to larger health gains than the predefined duration treatment programme, but it was considerably more expensive, and hence not cost-effective at current Dutch thresholds. Depending on the preferences and budgets available, each programme has its own benefits. CLINICAL IMPLICATION: This study provides valuable information to decision-makers for optimising treatment allocation and enhancing quality of care cost-effectively.",2023,Nov,BMJ Ment Health,26,1,,,10.1136/bmjment-2023-300792,37967994,#705,Li 2023,,,0
Hybrid Cardiac Rehabilitation Program in a Low-Resource Setting: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,Seron P; Oliveros MJ; Marzuca-Nassr GN; Morales G; Román C; Muñoz SR; Gálvez M; Latin G; Marileo T; Molina JP; Navarro R; Sepúlveda P; Lanas F; Saavedra N; Ulloa C; Grace SL,"IMPORTANCE: While effective, cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR) as traditionally delivered is not well implemented in lower-resource settings. OBJECTIVE: To test the noninferiority of hybrid CR compared with traditional CR in terms of cardiovascular events. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pragmatic, multicenter, parallel arm, open-label randomized clinical trial (the Hybrid Cardiac Rehabilitation Trial [HYCARET]) with blinded outcome assessment was conducted at 6 referral centers in Chile. Adults aged 18 years or older who had a cardiovascular event or procedure, no contraindications to exercise, and access to a mobile telephone were eligible and recruited between April 1, 2019, and March 15, 2020, with follow-up until July 29, 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 1:1 in permuted blocks to the experimental arm, which received 10 center-based supervised exercise sessions plus counseling in 4 to 6 weeks and then were supported at home via telephone calls and text messages through weeks 8 to 12, or the control arm, which received the standard CR of 18 to 22 sessions with exercises and education in 8 to 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was cardiovascular events or mortality. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, return to work, and lifestyle behaviors measured with validated questionnaires; muscle strength and functional capacity, measured through physical tests; and program adherence and exercise-related adverse events, assessed using checklists. RESULTS: A total of 191 participants were included (mean [SD] age, 58.74 [9.80] years; 145 [75.92%] male); 93 were assigned to hybrid CR and 98 to standard CR. At 1 year, events had occurred in 5 unique participants in the hybrid CR group (5.38%) and 9 in the standard CR group (9.18%). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the hybrid CR group had 3.80% (95% CI, -11.13% to 3.52%) fewer cardiovascular events than the standard CR group, and relative risk was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.20-1.68) for the primary outcome. In the per-protocol analysis at different levels of adherence to the intervention, all 95% CIs crossed the noninferiority boundary (eg, 20% adherence: absolute risk difference, -0.35% [95% CI, -7.56% to 6.85%]; 80% adherence: absolute risk difference, 3.30% [95% CI, -3.70% to 10.31%]). No between-group differences were found for secondary outcomes except adherence to supervised CR sessions (79.14% [736 of 930 supervised sessions] in the hybrid CR group vs 61.46% [1201 of 1954 sessions] in the standard CR group). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results suggest that a hybrid CR program is noninferior to standard center-based CR in a low-resource setting, primarily in terms of recurrent cardiovascular events and potentially in terms of intermediate outcomes. Hybrid CR may induce superior adherence to supervised exercise. Clinical factors and patient preferences should inform CR model allocation.

Perceptions and drivers of healthcare provider and drug dispenser practices for the treatment of malaria in pregnancy in the context of multiple first-line therapies in western Kenya: a qualitative study.,Osoro CB; Dellicour S; Ochodo E; Young T; Ter Kuile FO; Gutman JR; Hill J,"BACKGROUND: Emergence of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemether-lumefantrine in Africa prompted the pilot introduction of multiple first-line therapies (MFT) against malaria in Kenya, potentially exposing women-of-childbearing-age (WOCBAs) to anti-malarials with unknown safety profiles in the first trimester. This qualitative study explored knowledge and perceptions among healthcare providers providing malaria treatment to WOCBAs and pregnant women. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with purposively selected public and private health facility (HF) and drug outlet (DO) providers within and outside the pilot-MFT area. County health managers were interviewed about their knowledge of the national treatment guidelines. Transcripts were coded by content analysis using the World Health Organization health system building blocks (leadership/governance, financing, health workforce, health information systems, access to medicines, and service delivery). RESULTS: Thirty providers (HF:21, DO:9) and three health managers were interviewed. Eighteen providers were from HFs in the pilot-MFT area; the remaining three and all nine DOs were outside the pilot-MFT area. The analysis revealed that providers had not been trained in malaria case management in the previous twelve months. DO providers were unfamiliar with national treatment guidelines in pregnancy and reported having no pregnancy tests. Health managers were unable to supervise DOs due to resource limitations. Providers from HFs and DOs noted poor sensitivity of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and hesitancy among patients who associated malaria-RDTs with HIV testing. Almost all providers reported anti-malarial stock-outs, with quinine most affected. Patient preference was a major factor in prescribing anti-malarials. Providers in HFs and DOs reported preferentially using artemether-lumefantrine in the first trimester due to the side effects and unavailability of quinine. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of malaria case management in drug outlets and health facilities remains poor. Improved regulation of DO providers is warranted. Optimizing treatment of malaria in pregnancy requires training, availability of malaria commodities, and pregnancy tests.",2023,Sep,Malar J,22,1,274,,10.1186/s12936-023-04698-w,37710229,#877,Osoro 2023,,,0
The heterogeneity of public preferences for the first healthcare visit: A discrete choice experiment in the context of Vietnam.,Nguyen HTT; Vo TQ; Tran HTB; Nguyen BT; Nguyen HT; Nguyen TD; Anuratpanich L,"Primary healthcare is critical in addressing the main health problems of communities. In Vietnam, the increasing healthcare demands cause major challenges, especially overcrowding. This study identified public preferences regarding the selection of healthcare facilities for first visit. A discrete choice online survey was generated from five attributes including visit duration, travel time, personal connection with medical staff, doctors' experience, and health insurance. A D(z) -efficient design constructed 36 choice sets, divided into three blocks of 12 choice sets. Each block formed one version of the questionnaire, which was randomly distributed to the participants. Heterogeneity in participant preferences was analysed by a latent class model with socio demographic characteristics and experiences of the last visit. 822 participants valued doctors' experience for both minor and severe symptoms. Preference heterogeneity for minor symptoms was quick service provision, highly experienced doctors, and payment through health insurance for the first (44.18%), second (32.17%), and third classes (23.66%), respectively. Regarding severe symptoms, they favoured all five attributes, quick health service, and reduced travel time for the first, second, and third classes, respectively (heterogeneities of 58.16%, 27.79%, and 14.05%, respectively). Predictions of choice from the worst to optimal healthcare facility scenario were 8.91%-61.91% and 10.16%-69.83% for minor and severe symptoms, respectively.

Advances in Human-Centered Care to Address Contemporary Unmet Needs in Chronic Dialysis.,Jayanti S; Rangan GK,"Advances in the treatment of kidney failure with chronic dialysis have stagnated over the past three decades, with over 50% of patients still managed by conventional in-hospital haemodialysis. In parallel, the demands of chronic dialysis medical care have changed and evolved due to a growing population that has higher frailty and multimorbidity. Thus, the gap between the needs of kidney failure patients and the healthcare capability to provide effective overall management has widened. To address this problem, healthcare policy has increasingly aligned towards a human-centred approach. The paradigm shift of human-centred approach places patients at the forefront of decision-making processes, ensuring that specific needs are understood and prioritised. Integration of human-centred approaches with patient care has been shown to improve satisfaction and quality of life. The aim of this narrative is to evaluate the current clinical challenges for managing kidney failure for dialysis providers; summarise current experiences and unmet needs of chronic dialysis patients; and finally emphasise how human-centred care has advanced chronic dialysis care. Specific incremental advances include implementation of renal supportive care; home-assisted dialysis; hybrid dialysis; refinements to dialysis methods; whereas emerging advances include portable and wearable dialysis devices and the potential for the integration of artificial intelligence in clinical practice.",2024,,Int J Nephrol Renovasc Dis,17,,91-104,,10.2147/IJNRD.S387598,38525412,#224,Jayanti 2024,,,0

The Relative Importance of Factors That Applicants Weigh When Ranking Adult Reconstruction Fellowships as Well as Their Perspectives on Robotic-Assisted Arthroplasty.,Grant AR; Zvi YS; Michalowski AK; Mattingly DA; Smith EL,"BACKGROUND: Orthopedic Surgery Fellowship programs offer highly specialized training that varies based on the training environment and surgical experience. Additionally, for Adult Reconstruction programs, robotic-assisted surgery exposure has been a widely discussed topic. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative value of various factors to Adult Hip and Knee Fellowship applicants, and their perceptions of robotic-assisted arthroplasty. METHODS: We surveyed 780 applicants who applied to our fellowship to matriculate in 2020 to 2024. We received 158 responses (20.3% response rate). We assessed factors concerning people and perceptions, logistics, salary and benefits, program reputation and curriculum, and surgical experience. Additionally, we surveyed fellows' attitudes toward using robotic surgery and its impact on patient outcomes. RESULTS: The highest-rated factors were Level of Hands-On Operative Experience (4.83), Revision Hip Volume (4.72), Revision Knee Volume (4.71), Multiple Surgical Exposures to the Hip (4.59), and Clinical Case Variety (4.59). Respondents who were postfellowship matriculation placed significantly more value on Exposure to Multiple Attendings with Surgical Diversity (P = .01), and Anterior Hip Volume (P = .04), and less value on Geographic Location (P = .04) and Patient-Specific Instrumentation (P = .02) than prematriculates. Overall, 65% of applicants plan to or currently use robotics, 7.6% do not, and 27.2% said ""Maybe"". Those who plan to or currently use robotics most cited procedure fidelity, patient-preference, and marketability as reasons to use robotics. CONCLUSIONS: Hands-on surgical experience and revision volume were the most important factors for fellowship applicants. Applicants placed lower importance on robotics exposure and their perspectives on robotics in their future practice were highly variable. Our results will inform fellowship programs and future applicants what previous applicants have valued in their training to help guide fellowship program structure, resource management, as well as recruitment.",2023,Dec,J Arthroplasty,,,,,10.1016/j.arth.2023.12.016,38103804,#565,Grant 2023,,,0
Associations of Air Pollution and Serum Biomarker Abnormalities in Individuals with Hemodialysis-Dependent Kidney Failure.,Xi Y; Richardson DB; Kshirsagar AV; Flythe JE; Whitsel EA; Wade TJ; Rappold AG,"BACKGROUND: Ambient particles with a median aerodynamic diameter of <2.5 µm (PM2.5) is a ubiquitous air pollutant with established adverse health consequences. While postulated to promote a systemic inflammatory response, limited studies have demonstrated changes in serum biomarkers related to PM2.5 exposure. We aim to examine associations between short-term PM2.5 exposure and commonly measured biomarkers known to be affected by inflammation among patients receiving maintenance in-center hemodialysis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective open cohort study from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2014. Adult hemodialysis patients were identified from the United States Renal Data System and linked at the patient level to laboratory data from a large dialysis organization. Daily ambient PM2.5 was estimated on a 1-km grid and assigned to cohort patients based on the ZIP codes of dialysis clinics. Serum albumin, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), and serum hemoglobin were ascertained from the dialysis provider organization database. Mixed-effect models were used to assess the changes in biomarker levels associated with PM2.5 exposure. RESULTS: The final cohort included 173,697 hemodialysis patients. Overall, the daily ZIP-level ambient PM2.5 averages were 8.4-8.5 µg/m3. A 10-µg/m3 increase in same-day ambient PM2.5 exposure was associated with higher relative risks of lower albumin (relative risk [RR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01 to 1.02) and lower hemoglobin (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.03). Associations of same-day ambient PM2.5 exposure and higher ferritin and lower TSAT did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term PM2.5 exposure was associated with lower serum hemoglobin and albumin among patients receiving in-center hemodialysis.

The purpose of this study was to investigate real-world experiences of patients with HA treated with N8-GP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 25-minute online survey was completed by adults (≥18 years) and caregivers of adolescents (12-16 years) with HA receiving N8-GP across six countries (Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, UK and US). Patients were recruited using a multichannel approach through recruitment panels, referrals from healthcare professionals and patient associations. The survey comprised a questionnaire with metrics including satisfaction and preferences for N8-GP, quality of life (QoL) and long-term impact. RESULTS: A total of 62 participants (98% male [n=61], mean age 29 years) comprising 46 patients and 16 caregivers completed the survey. Patients (60% non-severe [n=37] and 40% severe [25]) were on N8-GP for a mean period of 1.4 years. Patients expressed satisfaction (95% vs 42%, p<0.001) and preference (91% vs 9%, p<0.001) for N8-GP vs their previous treatments. Most patients with severe HA (87%, p=0.038) and patients on prophylaxis (84%, p<0.001) stated lower frequency of injections as their main reason for satisfaction, while improved QoL drove satisfaction for non-severe patients (81%, p=0.053). Overall, patients perceived that QoL score improved (74.8 vs 65.9, p=0.01) with N8-GP treatment compared with previous treatments. Flexibility to store at room temperature was one of the key convenience factors driving satisfaction. Patients believed that N8-GP can offer a long-term impact in areas such as ability to perform day-to-day activities (68%), independence to live like a person without hemophilia (63%), ability to travel (60%) with a feeling of optimism and hopefulness (82%). CONCLUSION: Lower frequency of injections, storage flexibility and improved QoL drove satisfaction and preference for N8-GP over previous treatments among patients with HA.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,3001-3014,,10.2147/PPA.S394216,38027080,#678,Eichler 2023,,,0
Preferences of women in difficult life situations for a physical activity programme: protocol of a discrete choice experiment in the German NU-BIG project.,Pedron S; Herbert-Maul A; Sauter A; Linder S; Sommer R; Vomhof M; Gontscharuk V; Abu-Omar K; Thiel A; Ziemainz H; Holle R; Laxy M,"INTRODUCTION: The BIG project ('Bewegung als Investition in die Gesundheit', ie, 'Movement as Investment in Health') was developed in 2005 as a community-based participatory research programme to offer accessible opportunities for physical activity to women in difficult life situations. Since then, the programme has been expanded to eight sites in Germany. A systematic evaluation of BIG is currently being conducted. As part of this effort, we strive to understand the preferences of participating women for different aspects of the programme, and to analyse their willingness to pay. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this protocol, we describe the development and analysis plan of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to investigate participants' preferences for a physical activity programme for women in difficult life situations. The experiment will be embedded in a questionnaire covering several aspects of participation in the programme (eg, reach, efficacy and further effects) and the socioeconomic characteristics of all active participants. After a thorough search of the literature, BIG documents review and expert interviews, we identified five important attributes of the programme: course times, travel time to the course venue, additional social activities organised by BIG, consideration of wishes and interests for the further planning of courses and costs per course unit. Thereafter, we piloted the experiment with a sample of participants from the target group. After data collection, the experiment will be analysed using a conditional logit model and a latent class analysis to assess eventual heterogeneity in preferences. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Understanding women's preferences will provide useful insights for the further development of the programme and ultimately increase participation and retention. The questionnaire, the included DCE and the pretest on participants received ethical approval (application no. 20-247_1-B). We plan to disseminate the results of the DCE in peer-reviewed journals, national conferences and among participants and programme coordinators and organisers.",2023,Jul,BMJ Open,13,7,e067235,,10.1136/bmjopen-2022-067235,37460258,#1057,Pedron 2023,,,1
Considering patient perspectives in economic evaluations of health interventions.,Fu R; Ng V; Liu M; Wells D; Yurga E; Nauenberg E,"Current guidelines for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of health interventions commonly recommend the use of a payer and/or a societal perspective. This raises the concern that the resulting reimbursement decision may overlook the full spectrum of impacts and equity considerations. In this paper, we argue that a potential solution is to supplement a societal- or payer-perspective economic evaluation with an additional evaluation accounting for exclusively the patient perspective. We present five categories of health interventions for which a patient-perspective analysis may be informative including those (1) that cross the definitional boundary between drugs and non-drug technologies; (2) affect patient adherence to protocol; (3) represent revolutionary treatments for genetic disorders; (4) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio involving slightly less effective, but substantially less costly, than the current standard; and (5) have been previously approved for funding but now being targeted for potential delisting or disinvestment.

Ethics of the algorithmic prediction of goal of care preferences: from theory to practice.,Ferrario A; Gloeckler S; Biller-Andorno N,"Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are quickly gaining ground in healthcare and clinical decision-making. However, it is still unclear in what way AI can or should support decision-making that is based on incapacitated patients' values and goals of care, which often requires input from clinicians and loved ones. Although the use of algorithms to predict patients' most likely preferred treatment has been discussed in the medical ethics literature, no example has been realised in clinical practice. This is due, arguably, to the lack of a structured approach to the epistemological, ethical and pragmatic challenges arising from the design and use of such algorithms. The present paper offers a new perspective on the problem by suggesting that preference predicting AIs be viewed as sociotechnical systems with distinctive life-cycles. We explore how both known and novel challenges map onto the different stages of development, highlighting interdisciplinary strategies for their resolution.",2023,Mar,J Med Ethics,49,3,165-174,,10.1136/jme-2022-108371,36347603,#1482,Ferrario 2023,,,0

Cancer patients' expectations of advance care planning: A typological content analysis of qualitative interviews.,Pedrosa AJ; Demel L; Riera Knorrenschild J; Seifart C; von Blanckenburg P,"BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) can help to elicit cancer patients' preferences in a discussion process to promote person-centred medical decision-making. Expectations are known to be highly relevant determinants of decisional processes. So far, however, little is known about cancer patients' expectations of ACP that lead to acceptance or refusal of the programme. The presented study, therefore, aims to explore cancer patients' expectations of ACP. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposeful sample of 27 cancer patients consenting to or refusing a newly implemented ACP programme in a German university hospital. Data were analysed using typological content analysis. RESULTS: We identified five different expectation clusters in relation to ACP. Consenting participants held expectations about the impact of ACP that were either 'ego-centred' or 'family-centred'. Refusers had expectations based on ignorance and misinformation, or-if they had already completed an advance directive-expectations to avoid unpleasant redundancy, perceiving no additional benefit but a burden from ACP. Finally, refusers in particular expressed expectations of delegated responsibility at the end of life, including anticipation of proxy decision-making. CONCLUSION: Our study results suggest that expectation-modifying measures could be taken to positively influence cancer patients' expectations and thus the acceptance of ACP. In this respect, reducing ignorance and misguided expectations plays a decisive role. Especially in family constellations with expected delegation of responsibility and dependence at the end of life, it might be important to promote ACP as a family-intervention to improve family outcomes.",2023,Dec,Psychooncology,32,12,1867-1875,,10.1002/pon.6234,37905904,#606,Pedrosa 2023,,,0
Outcomes of Operative Versus Nonoperative Management for Hallux Rigidus: A Tertiary Care Center Experience.,Alshehri AS; Alzahrani FA; Alqahtani LS; Alhadlaq KH; Alshabraqi HA; Aljaafri ZA,"Background This study aims to investigate and report the outcomes of various management modalities used for hallux rigidus, a common form of degenerative joint disease affecting the foot and ankle. The research focuses on understanding the pathophysiology, classification systems, and nonoperative approaches such as medical therapy, intra-articular injections, shoe modifications, and physical therapy. Surgical techniques, including joint-sparing and joint-sacrificing procedures, are explored, considering factors such as disease stage and patient preferences. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), Riyadh. The study included all patients who were diagnosed with hallux rigidus from the period 2016 to 2022. Data were collected through the BESTCare system at KAMC. All the data were collected through Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) and transferred for analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25 (Released 2017; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York). Frequencies and percentages were used to detail categorical variables, whereas continuous variables were examined by the mean and standard deviation. A p-value of <0.05 was considered to report the statistical significance. Results A total of 84 patients were included. The majority were women (60.7%). Diabetes and hypertension were prevalent comorbidities, affecting 21.4% and 35.7% of patients, respectively. Nonoperative management was the most common approach (66.7%). Complications were minimal (2.4% infections, 1.2% metatarsalgia), and 67.9% of patients reported no persistence of symptoms after treatment. Conclusion The low complication rates and the lack of significant associations between treatment modalities and outcomes suggest the generally safe and effective nature of the employed interventions. These findings can guide clinicians in making informed decisions regarding the management of hallux rigidus, while also highlighting areas for further research to improve treatment strategies and outcomes.",2023,Oct,Cureus,15,10,e46991,,10.7759/cureus.46991,38022308,#776,Alshehri 2023,,,0
Fast-Track Pathway: An Effective Way to Boost Diabetic Foot Care.,Lashkarbolouk N; Mazandarani M; Mohajeri Tehrani MR; Aalaa M; Sanjari M; Mehrdad N; Reza Amini M,"Diabetes is a chronic disease that challenges global health issues in many aspects. Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is one of the most common causes of reduced quality of life and increased hospitalization, amputation, treatment costs, and mortality in patients. Improper patients' knowledge, unsatisfactory education and training of healthcare workers, and limited facilities are the major cause of delayed referral and downscale management in DFUs. The diabetic foot clinical pathway is pivotal in providing best practices based on the latest standards and patient preferences. In the diabetic foot clinical pathway provided by the Iran Ministry of Health, the common concepts and grading systems are well defined for diabetic foot specialists so that patients can be diagnosed correctly and referred properly. Based on clinical examination guidelines, patients with diabetes are classified into low-risk, moderate-risk, high-risk, and active diabetic foot ulcer groups. One of this Pathway's main objectives is to prevent the patient from getting the first ulcer, prevent frequent recurrence ulcers, and most importantly, prevent minor and major amputation.",2023,,Clin Med Insights Endocrinol Diabetes,16,,11795514231189048,,10.1177/11795514231189048,37529303,#1039,Lashkarbolouk 2023,,,0
Very early medical abortion: treatment with mifepristone and misoprostol before ultrasonographic visualisation of an intrauterine pregnancy.,Tai NQR; Reynolds-Wright JJ; Cameron S,"INTRODUCTION: Abortion providers may be reluctant to commence abortion before ultrasound evidence of intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) due to concerns of missed ectopic pregnancy. In 2017, very early medical abortion (VEMA) was introduced at an abortion service in Edinburgh, UK. Following ultrasound, patients without confirmed IUP, and without symptoms or risk factors for ectopic pregnancy, could commence treatment immediately after baseline serum-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) measurement, and return for follow-up serum-hCG a week later to determine treatment success (≥80% decline from baseline). This study aimed to compare clinical outcomes between two pathways: (1) VEMA; and (2) standard-of-care delayed treatment where treatment is only commenced on IUP confirmation by serial serum-hCG monitoring and/or repeat ultrasound. METHODS: A retrospective database review was conducted of VEMA eligible patients from July 2017 to December 2021. Study groups were determined by patient preference. Records were searched for abortion outcomes, duration of care, number of appointments (clinic visits, ultrasounds, serum-hCG) and clinical data entries. RESULTS: Of 181 patients included, 77 (43%) chose VEMA and 104 (57%) chose delayed treatment. 11/181 (6.1%) were lost to follow-up. Cohort ectopic prevalence was 4.4% and was not statistically different between groups (2.6% vs 5.8%, VEMA vs delayed group, respectively, p=0.305), as with complete abortion rates (93.3% vs 97.6%, p=0.256). All VEMA group ectopics were detected on the seventh day (from initial visit) while time-to-diagnosis for delayed group ectopics ranged from 7 days to 3 weeks. VEMA patients had significantly reduced duration of care (12 vs 21 days, p<0.001), number of visits (2 vs 3, p<0.001), ultrasounds (1 vs 2, p<0.001) and data entries (6 vs 9, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: VEMA is safe, effective and reduces the duration of care, number of appointments and clinical administrative time. It should be offered to medically eligible patients.",2023,Apr,BMJ Sex Reprod Health,49,2,97-104,,10.1136/bmjsrh-2022-201677,36351785,#1376,TaiNQR 2023,,,0
"Getting to know our patients and what matters: exploring the elicitation of patient values, preferences, and circumstances in neurological rehabilitation.",Vingerhoets C; Hay-Smith J; Graham F,"PURPOSE: Patient values, preferences, and circumstances are critical to decision-making in both patient-centred and evidence-based practice models of healthcare. Despite the established importance of integrating these patient attributes, the ways they are elicited in rehabilitation remain unclear. This study aimed to explore how health professionals elicit and share patients' 'values', 'preferences', and 'circumstances', and what they understand by the terms. METHODS: This exploratory qualitative descriptive study used interviews with 13 clinicians from interprofessional teams in inpatient neurological rehabilitation. Data were analysed using a general inductive approach. RESULTS: Participants understood 'values' to mean what is important and meaningful; 'preferences' as likes/dislikes and choices; and 'circumstances' as the social, physical, and environmental context surrounding the person. Formal and informal strategies were used to gather information directly from patients or indirectly from other sources. The processes of eliciting and communicating this information were influenced by relationships and relied on contributions from many people. Elicitation involved a flexible approach tailored to the individual and considering each unique context. CONCLUSION: The strategies used and the approach used to implement these strategies were both essential to eliciting patient values, preferences, and circumstances in neurological rehabilitation. These findings offer insights into the practices of interprofessional rehabilitation clinicians. Implications for rehabilitationEliciting patient values, preferences, and circumstances involves a combination of strategies and approaches that are applied gradually throughout the continuum of rehabilitation.These processes are flexible, and strategies should be tailored to individual patients/families and phases of rehabilitation.Clinicians should be attentive to informal opportunities to gather valuable information throughout rehabilitation.Establishing positive relationships and using effective communication is foundational to these processes.",2023,May,Disabil Rehabil,45,9,1444-1452,,10.1080/09638288.2022.2063416,35476588,#1303,Vingerhoets 2023,,,0
Preference of young adults for COVID-19 vaccination in the United Kingdom: a discrete choice experiment.,Böger S; van Bergen I; Beaudart C; Cheung KL; Hiligsmann M,"OBJECTIVES: To determine preferences for COVID-19 vaccinations in the young adult population in the United Kingdom (UK). METHOD: A discrete choice experiment survey was conducted in UK young adults. Participants were asked to choose between two hypothetical vaccines the one they preferred the most. Vaccines were defined by five attributes (effectiveness, risk of side effects, duration of protection, number of doses, confidence in available evidence), identified following a systematic literature review and qualitative interviews with 13 young adults. A random parameters logit model, a latent class model, and subgroup analyses were used to identify preferences. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-nine respondents were included (70% women, mean age 23 years). All five attributes significantly influenced respondents' vaccination decisions. Respondents valued higher effectiveness, lower risk of side effects, longer protection duration, and a smaller number of doses. Based on the range of levels of each attribute, vaccine effectiveness was the most important attribute (relative importance 34%), followed by risk of side effects (32%), and duration of vaccine protection (22%). CONCLUSIONS: The five investigated vaccine attributes appear to play an important role in young adults' decision-making process.

Inter-hospital Transfer Decision-making During the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Qualitative Study.,Harlan EA; Mubarak E; Firn J; Goold SD; Shuman AG,"BACKGROUND: Inter-hospital patient transfers to hospitals with greater resource availability and expertise may improve clinical outcomes. However, there is little guidance regarding how patient transfer requests should be prioritized when hospital resources become scarce. OBJECTIVE: To understand the experiences of healthcare workers involved in the process of accepting inter-hospital patient transfers during a pandemic surge and determine factors impacting inter-hospital patient transfer decision-making. DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative study consisting of semi-structured interviews between October 2021 and February 2022. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible participants were physicians, nurses, and non-clinician administrators involved in the process of accepting inter-hospital patient transfers. Participants were recruited using maximum variation sampling. APPROACH: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with healthcare workers across Michigan. KEY RESULTS: Twenty-one participants from 15 hospitals were interviewed (45.5% of eligible hospitals). About half (52.4%) of participants were physicians, 38.1% were nurses, and 9.5% were non-clinician administrators. Three domains of themes impacting patient transfer decision-making emerged: decision-maker, patient, and environmental factors. Decision-makers described a lack of guidance for transfer decision-making. Patient factors included severity of illness, predicted chance of survival, need for specialized care, and patient preferences for medical care. Decision-making occurred within the context of environmental factors including scarce resources at accepting and requesting hospitals, organizational changes to transfer processes, and alternatives to patient transfer including use of virtual care. Participants described substantial moral distress related to transfer triaging. CONCLUSIONS: A lack of guidance in transfer processes may result in considerable variation in the patients who are accepted for inter-hospital transfer and in substantial moral distress among decision-makers involved in the transfer process. Our findings identify potential organizational changes to improve the inter-hospital transfer process and alleviate the moral distress experienced by decision-makers.",2023,Aug,J Gen Intern Med,38,11,2568-2576,,10.1007/s11606-023-08237-w,37254008,#1014,Harlan 2023,,,0
Quantifying Benefit-Risk Trade-Offs Toward Prophylactic Treatment Among Adult Patients With Hemophilia A in China: Discrete Choice Experiment Study.,Wang L; Liu S; Jiang S; Li C; Lu L; Fang Y; Li S,"BACKGROUND: Hemophilia A is a chronic condition that requires meticulous treatment and management. Patient preferences for prophylactic treatment can substantially influence adherence, outcomes, and quality of life, yet these preferences remain underexplored, particularly in China. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the preferences for prophylactic treatment among Chinese adult patients with hemophilia A without inhibitors, considering clinical effectiveness, side effects, dosing mode, and dosing frequency. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was used to elicit patient preferences for prophylactic treatment of hemophilia. The study was conducted across 7 provinces in China with socioeconomic and geographical diversity. Subgroup analysis was performed according to education level, geographic location, and treatment type, alongside the exploration of benefit-risk trade-offs. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients completed the discrete choice experiment questionnaire, and we included 102 responses for analysis based on predetermined exclusion criteria. The study found that patients prioritized reducing annual bleeding times and avoiding the risk of developing inhibitors over treatment process attributes. Subgroup analysis revealed that lower-educated patients and those from rural areas attached more importance to the dosing mode, likely due to barriers to self-administration. Patients demonstrated a clear understanding of benefit-risk trade-offs, exhibiting a willingness to accept an increased risk of developing inhibitors for improved clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides valuable insights into the preferences of patients with hemophilia A for prophylactic treatment in China. Understanding these preferences can enhance shared decision-making between patients and clinicians, fostering personalized prophylactic treatment plans that may optimize adherence and improve clinical outcomes.",2023,Jul,JMIR Public Health Surveill,9,,e45747,,10.2196/45747,37494098,#1043,Wang 2023,,,1

Acne characteristics in Latin American patients and the potential role of trifarotene.,da Rocha MAD; Fierro-Arias L; Cohen Sabban EN; Castillo RS; Chavda R; Almeida LM,"BACKGROUND: Individualization of treatment based on acne type and severity, location, disease burden, and patient preference is required to maximize efficacy, safety, and adherence to therapy. Latin American populations have unique attributes that must be considered as part of this process to improve clinical success and achieve patient goals. Acne is more common among patients with darker skin phototypes, in whom it is often associated with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring-the most important acne sequelae-potentially due to more frequent and more severe underlying inflammatory processes in this population. DISCUSSION: These data argue for an early and proactive approach to managing acne in these patients with agents that target the inflammatory processes that underlie acne and its sequelae. As a class, retinoids offer a spectrum of activity that may be useful in addressing the unique needs of Latin American populations.

A discrete choice experiment to understand public preferences and priorities for risk-stratified bowel cancer screening programmes in the UK.,Dennison RA; Thomas CV; Morris S; Usher-Smith JA,"OBJECTIVE: Public acceptability of bowel cancer screening programmes must be maintained, including if risk stratification is introduced. We aimed to describe and quantify preferences for different attributes of risk-stratified screening programmes amongst the UK population, focussing on who to invite for bowel screening. METHODS: We conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) including the following attributes: risk factors used to estimate bowel cancer risk (age plus/minus sex, lifestyle factors and genetics); personalisation of risk feedback; risk stratification strategy plus resource implications; default screening in the case of no risk information; number of deaths prevented by screening; and number experiencing physical harm from screening. We used the results of conditional logit regression models to estimate the importance of each attribute, willingness to trade-off between the attributes, and preferences for different programmes using contemporary risk scores and models. RESULTS: 1196 respondents completed the survey, generating 21,528 DCE observations. Deaths prevented was the most influential attribute on respondents' decision-making (contributing to 58.8% of the choice), followed by harms experienced (15.9%). For every three additional deaths prevented, respondents were willing to accept an additional screening harm per 100,000 people. Risk factors and risk stratification strategy contributed to just 11.1% and 3.6% of the choice, respectively. Although the influence on decision-making was small, respondents favoured more personalised feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Bowel cancer screening programmes that improve cancer outcomes, particularly by preventing more deaths amongst those screened, are most preferred by the public. Optimising risk prediction models, developing public communication, and readying infrastructure should be prioritised for implementation.",2023,Dec,Prev Med,177,,107786,,10.1016/j.ypmed.2023.107786,37984646,#599,Dennison 2023,,,1
How surgeons use risk calculators and non-clinical factors for informed consent and shared decision making: A qualitative study.,Panton J; Beaulieu-Jones BR; Marwaha JS; Woods AP; Nakikj D; Gehlenborg N; Brat GA,"BACKGROUND: The discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery with patients is a defining component of informed consent. As shared-decision making has become central to surgeon-patient communication, risk calculators have emerged as a tool to aid communication and decision-making. To optimize informed consent, it is necessary to understand how surgeons assess and communicate risk, and the role of risk calculators in this process. METHODS: We conducted interviews with 13 surgeons from two institutions to understand how surgeons assess risk, the role of risk calculators in decision-making, and how surgeons approach risk communication during informed consent. We performed a qualitative analysis of interviews based on SRQR guidelines. RESULTS: Our analysis yielded insights regarding (a) the landscape and approach to obtaining surgical consent; (b) detailed perceptions regarding the value and design of assessing and communicating risk; and (c) practical considerations regarding the future of personalized risk communication in decision-making. Above all, we found that non-clinical factors such as health and risk literacy are changing how surgeons assess and communicate risk, which diverges from traditional risk calculators. CONCLUSION: Principally, we found that surgeons incorporate a range of clinical and non-clinical factors to risk stratify patients and determine how to optimally frame and discuss risk with individual patients. We observed that surgeons' perception of risk communication, and the importance of eliciting patient preferences to direct shared-decision making, did not consistently align with patient priorities. This study underscored criticisms of risk calculators and novel decision-aids - which must be addressed prior to greater adoption.",2023,Nov,Am J Surg,226,5,660-667,,10.1016/j.amjsurg.2023.07.017,37468387,#736,Panton 2023,,,0
Hospital Culture and Intensity of End-of-Life Care at 3 Academic Medical Centers.,Dzeng E; Batten JN; Dohan D; Blythe J; Ritchie CS; Curtis JR,"IMPORTANCE: There is substantial institutional variability in the intensity of end-of-life care that is not explained by patient preferences. Hospital culture and institutional structures (eg, policies, practices, protocols, resources) might contribute to potentially nonbeneficial high-intensity life-sustaining treatments near the end of life. OBJECTIVE: To understand the role of hospital culture in the everyday dynamics of high-intensity end-of-life care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative ethnographic study was conducted at 3 academic hospitals in California and Washington that differed in end-of-life care intensity based on measures in the Dartmouth Atlas and included hospital-based clinicians, administrators, and leaders. Data were deductively and inductively analyzed using thematic analysis through an iterative coding process. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Institution-specific policies, practices, protocols, and resources and their role in the everyday dynamics of potentially nonbeneficial, high-intensity life-sustaining treatments. RESULTS: A total of 113 semistructured, in-depth interviews (66 women [58.4%]; 23 [20.4%] Asian, 1 [0.9%] Black, 5 [4.4%] Hispanic, 7 [6.2%] multiracial, and 70 [61.9%] White individuals) were conducted with inpatient-based clinicians and administrators between December 2018 and June 2022. Respondents at all hospitals described default tendencies to provide high-intensity treatments that they believed were universal in US hospitals. They also reported that proactive, concerted efforts among multiple care teams were required to deescalate high-intensity treatments. Efforts to deescalate were vulnerable to being undermined at multiple points during a patient's care trajectory by any individual or entity. Respondents described institution-specific policies, practices, protocols, and resources that engendered broadly held understandings of the importance of deescalating nonbeneficial life-sustaining treatments. Respondents at different hospitals reported different policies and practices that encouraged or discouraged deescalation. They described how these institutional structures contributed to the culture and everyday dynamics of end-of-life care at their institution. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this qualitative study, clinicians, administrators, and leaders at the hospitals studied reported that they work in a hospital culture in which high-intensity end-of-life care constitutes a default trajectory. Institutional structures and hospital cultures shape the everyday dynamics by which clinicians may deescalate end-of-life patients from this trajectory.

Experiences of and recommendations on clinical trial design in Alzheimer's disease from the participant's point of view: a mixed-methods study in two clinical trial centers in the Netherlands.,Ottenhoff L; Vijverberg EGB; Visser LNC; Verijp M; Prins ND; Van der Flier WM; Sikkes SAM,"INTRODUCTION: In the context of the development of pharmaceutical interventions, expectations and experiences of participants are essential. Their insights may be particularly helpful to address the challenges of recruiting and retaining participants for Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. We examined clinical trial participants' experiences to optimize trial design in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHOD: In this mixed-methods study, we included adults who participated in sponsor-initiated AD trials at Brain Research Center, a clinical trial organization in the Netherlands. Participants (N = 71, age 69 ± 6.5, 54%F, 19 cognitively normal (CN), 19 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 33 AD dementia) first completed an online survey. Diagnostic group differences were investigated using chi-square tests or one-way ANOVAs. Next, a subsample (N = 12; 8 = CN, 4 = MCI) participated in focus groups to gain in-depth insight into their opinions on optimizing trial design from a participants' point of view. Audio recordings from focus group interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by thematic content analysis by two independent researchers. RESULTS: Most reported motives for enrolment included ""to benefit future generations"" (89%), followed by ""for science"" (66%) and ""better monitoring"" (42%). Frequent suggestions for increasing willingness to participate included a smaller chance to receive placebo (n = 38, 54%), shorter travel times (n = 27, 38%), and sharing individual results of different assessments (n = 57, 80%), as well as receiving trial results (n = 52, 73). Highest visual analogue burden scores (0-100) were found for the lumbar puncture (M = 47.2, SD = 38.2) and cognitive assessments (M = 27.2, SD = 25.7). Results did not differ between diagnostic groups, nor between patient and caregiver participants (all p-values>.05). Two additional themes emerged from the focus groups: ""trial design,"" such as follow-up visit(s) after participating, and ""trial center,"" including the relevance of a professional and empathic staff. CONCLUSION: Relevant factors include expectation management and careful planning of high-burden assessments, provision of individual feedback, and prioritizing professionalism and empathy throughout conduct of the trial. Our findings provide insight into participants' priorities to increase willingness to participate and can be used to optimize trial success.",2023,Apr,Alzheimers Res Ther,15,1,72,,10.1186/s13195-023-01190-0,37016435,#1335,Ottenhoff 2023,,,0
Genetic counseling and testing for females at elevated risk for breast cancer: Protocol for the randomized controlled trial of the Know Your Risk intervention.,Sweet K; Reiter PL; Schnell PM; Senter L; Shane-Carson KP; Aeilts A; Cooper J; Spears C; Brown J; Toland AE; Agnese DM; Katz ML,"BACKGROUND: Genetic counseling and testing have an important role in the care of patients at elevated risk for breast cancer. However, conventional pre- and post-test genetic counseling is labor and time intensive, less accessible for patients living outside major urban centers, and impractical on a large scale. A patient-driven approach to genetic counseling and testing may increase access, improve patients' experiences, affect efficiency of clinical practice, and help meet workforce demand. The objective of this 2-arm randomized controlled trial is to determine the efficacy of Know Your Risk (KYR), a genetic counseling patient preference intervention. METHODS: Females (n = 1000) at elevated risk (>20% lifetime) for breast cancer will be randomized to the KYR intervention or conventional genetic counseling. The study will provide comprehensive assessment of breast cancer risk by multigene panel testing and validated polygenic risk score. Primary outcome is adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for a clinical encounter every 6-12 months and an annual mammogram (breast MRI if recommended) determined by medical record review. Secondary outcomes include adherence to other recommended cancer screening tests determined by medical record review and changes in breast cancer knowledge, perception of risk, post-test/counseling distress, and satisfaction with counseling by completion of three surveys during the study. Study aims will be evaluated for non-inferiority of the KYR intervention compared to conventional genetic counseling. CONCLUSION: If efficacious, the KYR intervention has the potential to improve patients' experience and may change how genetic counseling is delivered, inform best practices, and reduce workforce burden.

Virtual multidisciplinary pain treatment: Experiences and feedback from children with chronic pain and their caregivers.,Ruskin D; Tremblay M; Szczech K; Rosenbloom BN; Mesaroli G; Sun N; D'Alessandro LN,"BACKGROUND: The onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) necessitated a rapid transition to virtual care for chronic pain treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study examined experiences of patients and caregivers who received virtual multidisciplinary pain treatment (MDT) for pediatric chronic pain between March 2020 and August 2021. METHODS: A mixed methods design was implemented using qualitative interviews and quantitative satisfaction surveys. Satisfaction surveys were administered to a convenience sample of patients (aged 8 to 18; N = 20) and their caregivers (N = 20) who received MDT through an outpatient hospital pediatric chronic pain program. Interviews were conducted with a subset of these patients and their caregivers (n = 6). RESULTS: Analysis of interviews revealed four themes: 1) benefits of virtual care; 2) challenges of virtual care; 3) recommendations and evaluation of virtual care; and 4) patient preferences. Analysis of the satisfaction survey data revealed that while patients and caregivers were satisfied with many aspects of virtual care, 65% (n = 13) of patients reported a preference for in-person appointments, with caregivers showing equal preference for in-person and virtual appointments, though this was a non-significant difference (p = .37). Overall, both patients and caregivers stated a stronger preference for in-person physiotherapy sessions but were willing to have psychology sessions provided virtually. Finally, the most reported preference was for a hybrid model of care incorporating at least some in-person contact with providers. CONCLUSION: This study provides a rich exploration of virtual care for multidisciplinary pediatric chronic pain treatment. The current results may inform the future development of guidelines for virtual care delivery with pediatric chronic pain populations.",2023,Feb,Physiother Theory Pract,,,1-21,,10.1080/09593985.2023.2171750,36748713,#1522,Ruskin 2023,,,0
Surgical service and distance traveled drive patient preference for Care Hotel: a retrospective cohort study.,Maniaci MJ; Chadha RM; Fazio JR; Maita KC; Love EA; Boyle VL; Heckman MG; Johnson PW; Paulson MR; Forte AJ,"Mayo Clinic's Care Hotel is a virtual hybrid care model which allows postoperative patients to recover in a comfortable environment after a low-risk procedure. Hospitals need to understand the key patient factors that promote acceptance of the Care Hotel if they are to benefit from this innovative care model. This study aims to identify factors that can predict whether a patient will stay at Care Hotel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective chart review of 1065 patients was conducted between 23 July 2020, and 31 December 2021. Variables examined included patient age, sex, race, ethnicity, Charlson comorbidity index, distance patient travelled to hospital, length of surgery, day of the week of surgery, and surgical service. Associations of patient and surgery characteristics with the primary outcome of staying at the Care Hotel were assessed using unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of the 1065 patients who met criteria for admission to the Care Hotel during the study period, 717 (67.3%) chose to stay at the Care Hotel while 328 (32.7%) choose to be admitted to the hospital. In multivariable analysis, there was a significant association between surgical service and staying at the Care Hotel (P<0.001). Specifically, there was a higher likelihood of staying at the Care Hotel for patients from Neurosurgery [odds rato (OR)=1.86, P=0.004], Otorhinolaryngology (OR=2.70, P<0.001), and General Surgery (OR=2.75, P=0.002). Additionally, there was a higher likelihood of staying at the Care Hotel with distance travelled over 110 miles [OR (per each doubling)=1.10, P=0.007]. CONCLUSION: When developing a post-surgical care model for patients following outpatient procedures, the referring surgical service is a primary factor to consider in order to ensure patient acceptance, along with patient distance. This study can assist other healthcare organizations considering this model, as it provides guidance on which factors are most indicative of acceptance.",2023,May,Ann Med Surg (Lond),85,5,1578-1583,,10.1097/MS9.0000000000000704,37229076,#1256,Maniaci 2023,,,0
Patient and Public Acceptance of Digital Technologies in Health Care: Protocol for a Discrete Choice Experiment.,Fischer AK; Mühlbacher AC,"BACKGROUND: Strokes pose a particular challenge to the health care system. Although stroke-related mortality has declined in recent decades, the absolute number of new strokes (incidence), stroke deaths, and survivors of stroke has increased. With the increasing need of neurorehabilitation and the decreasing number of professionals, innovations are needed to ensure adequate care. Digital technologies are increasingly used to meet patients' unfilled needs during their patient journey. Patients must adhere to unfamiliar digital technologies to engage in health interventions. Therefore, the acceptance of the benefits and burdens of digital technologies in health interventions is a key factor in implementing these innovations. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the development of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to weigh criteria that impact patient and public acceptance. Secondary study objectives are a benefit-burden assessment (estimation of the maximum acceptable burden of technical features and therapy-related characteristics for the patient or individual, eg, no human contact), overall comparison (assessment of the relative importance of attributes for comparing digital technologies), and adherence (identification of key attributes that influence patient adherence). The exploratory objectives include heterogeneity assessment and subgroup analysis. The methodological aims are to investigate the use of DCE. METHODS: To obtain information on the criteria impacting acceptance, a DCE will be conducted including 7 attributes based on formative qualitative research. Patients with stroke (experimental group) and the general population (control group) are surveyed. The final instrument includes 6 best-best choice tasks in partial design. The experimental design is a fractional-factorial efficient Bayesian design (D-error). A conditional logit regression model and mixed logistic regression models will be used for analysis. To consider the heterogeneity of subgroups, a latent class analysis and an analysis of heteroscedasticity will be performed. RESULTS: The literature review, qualitative preliminary study, survey development, and pretesting were completed. Data collection and analysis will be completed in the last quarter of 2023. CONCLUSIONS: Our results will inform decision makers about patients' and publics' acceptance of digital technologies used in innovative interventions. The patient preference information will improve decisions regarding the development, adoption, and pricing of innovative interventions. The behavioral changes in the choice of digital intervention alternatives are observable and can therefore be statistically analyzed. They can be translated into preferences, which define the value. This study will investigate the influences on the acceptance of digital interventions and thus support decisions and future research.

Co-creation of the Global Patient Experience Data Navigator: a multi-stakeholder initiative to ensure the patient voice is represented in health decision-making.,Willgoss T; Escontrias OA; Scrafton C; Oehrlein E; Livingstone V; Chaplin FC; Benivento M; Chapman H; Brooke N,"BACKGROUND: Putting patients' needs and priorities at the forefront of healthcare initiatives and medical product development is critical to achieve outcomes that matter most to patients. This relies on the integration of early, meaningful patient engagement (PE) to learn what is important to patients, and collection of representative patient experience data (PXD). The increased number of PE/PXD efforts across global regulatory, health technology assessment, and healthcare systems is an important step forward to deliver improved health outcomes for patients. However, these initiatives are fragmented and lack integration, which is necessary to maximize efforts and reduce burden on patients. To overcome these challenges, the Global Patient Experience Data Navigator has been co-created by Patient Focused Medicines Development to provide practical resources that can facilitate and optimize PXD generation, collection, analysis, and dissemination for patient benefit and aims to be applicable across all therapeutic areas for all stakeholders. METHODS: Co-creation of the Navigator took place through an iterative process of validation and formalization driven by a diverse, multi-stakeholder working group with individuals who have varying knowledge/experience in PE/PXD. RESULTS: A series of workshops took place to conduct a gap analysis, develop a taxonomy model, and integrate existing frameworks. The collective insights led to the development of the Navigator consisting of four specific tools in the form of downloadable templates, which can be used to: (1) prioritize outcomes that matter most to patients and their caregivers; (2) select appropriate measurement methods for these outcomes; (3) identify when and why PXD is used throughout the product development cycle for each stakeholder; (4) identify when and why PXD is used throughout the healthcare process for each stakeholder. A public consultation was carried out to collect user feedback before the Navigator was made publicly available in December 2022. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, the Global Patient Experience Data Navigator is the only publicly available toolkit developed with a multi-stakeholder and disease-agnostic approach providing taxonomically grouped resources to optimize the collection and collation of PXD for patient benefit. Future work will aim to further engage patients by adding a PE dimension to the Navigator.",2023,Oct,Res Involv Engagem,9,1,92,,10.1186/s40900-023-00503-9,37828617,#779,Willgoss 2023,,,0
What drives poor quality of care for child diarrhea? Experimental evidence from India.,Wagner Z; Mohanan M; Zutshi R; Mukherji A; Sood N,"Most health care providers in developing countries know that oral rehydration salts (ORS) are a lifesaving and inexpensive treatment for child diarrhea, yet few prescribe it. This know-do gap has puzzled experts for decades. Using randomized experiments in India, we estimated the extent to which ORS underprescription is driven by perceptions that patients do not want ORS, provider's financial incentives, and ORS stock-outs (out-of-stock events). Patients expressing a preference for ORS increased ORS prescribing by 27 percentage points. Eliminating stock-outs increased ORS provision by 7 percentage points. Removing financial incentives did not affect ORS prescribing on average but did increase ORS prescribing at pharmacies. We estimate that perceptions that patients do not want ORS explain 42% of underprescribing, whereas stock-outs and financial incentives explain only 6 and 5%, respectively.",2024,Feb,Science,383,6683,eadj9986,,10.1126/science.adj9986,38330118,#379,Wagner 2024,,,0
The Impact of Experience Versus Decision Aids on Patient Preference Toward Virtual Care.,Prater AR; McConnell JT; Yedulla NR; Peterson EL; Banka TR; Day CS,"INTRODUCTION: Virtual care utilization has increased in recent years bringing questions of how to best inform patients regarding their use. Decision aids (DAs) are tools created to assist patients in making informed decisions about their health care. This study seeks to determine whether a DA or previous experience could better educate and influence patient's preference on virtual care. METHODS: One hundred fifty participants from an orthopedic clinic of a multi-hospital system were divided into three groups. Group 1 (Virtual Care Cohort) had at least one previous virtual care visit and was surveyed with the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ). Group 2 (In-person with Decision Aid) and Group 3 (In-person without Decision Aid) had no virtual care experience. Group 2 received a validated virtual care DA with a knowledge test. Both groups were also administered the TSQ. RESULTS: After the DA, patients improved their score on 3 of 4 virtual care knowledge questions. Each cohort demonstrated a positive perception of virtual care; however, the specific reasons for their favorable views varied. The DA cohort did not show increased preference toward virtual care compared with the non-DA group and only responded significantly higher regarding encounter comfort. Patients with previous experience in virtual care responded most favorably to the majority of survey questions regarding their virtual care preferences when compared with both virtual care naive cohorts. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We found that patient experience was the most important factor in influencing patient preference toward virtual care. Although the DA increased their virtual care knowledge it did not increase their preference; therefore, efforts should be placed at encouraging patient to experience virtual care.",2024,,Telemed Rep,5,1,59-66,,10.1089/tmr.2024.0001,38558954,#219,Prater 2024,,,0
Combining Gluteal Shaping with High-Definition Liposuction: New Concepts and Techniques.,Hoyos Ariza AE; Perez Pachon M,"Gluteal contouring has been subject to numerous publications in aesthetic plastic surgery.

PRO Hair Safe Study: The Patient's Perspective on the Effects of Scalp Cooling on Hair Preservation.,Brunner C; Egle D; Ritter M; Kofler R; Giesinger JM; Schneitter L; Sztankay M; Emmelheinz M; Abdel Azim S; Wieser V; Oberguggenberger A,"PURPOSE: Alopecia has been reported a distressing side-effect of chemotherapy for breast cancer patients (BCP) that is highly relevant for quality of life during treatment. For the prevention of chemotherapy-induced alopecia, scalp cooling (SC) has been reported to be an effective and safe intervention. However, data on the patient's perspective on effectiveness and applicability of SC in a clinical routine setting are scarce. In this comparative study, we aimed at a longitudinal assessment of patient-reported outcome (PRO) data on the effect of SC on alopecia and its effect on symptoms and functional health when applied in clinical routine in BCP receiving taxane or anthracycline-based chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study participants were allocated either to the intervention group receiving SC or to the control group based on patient preference (non-randomized study). All patients completed PRO-measures on hair preservation (EORTC Item Library items on hair loss), symptom and functional health measures (EORTC QLQ-C30 and -BR23) and the Body Image Scale (BIS). Outcomes were assessed at chemotherapy start (baseline), mid-chemotherapy, last chemotherapy cycle, 3 months follow-up and 6-9 months follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, we included 113 patients: 75 patients underwent SC (mean age = 51.3 years, 52.7% premenopausal); 38 patients standard care (mean age = 55.6 years, 39.5% premenopausal). A total of 53 patients (70.7%) discontinued SC, with 39 patients (73.5%) stating alopecia as the primary reason. On average, BCP stayed on treatment with the cooling cap for 40.2% of the duration of their chemotherapy (SD 25.3%). In an intention-to-treat analysis, we found no difference between the SC group and the control group with regard to their patient-reported hair loss (p=0.831) across the observation period, overall QOL (p=0.627), emotional functioning (p=0.737), social functioning (p=0.635) and body image (p=0.463) did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: We found a high rate of SC-decliners and no beneficial effects of SC for patient-reported hair loss, symptoms and functional health. The efficacy and tolerability of SC applied in a clinical routine setting hence appeared to be limited. The further determination and up-front definition of criteria prognostic for effectiveness of SC may be helpful to identify patient subgroups that may experience a treatment benefit.",2023,,Breast Cancer (Dove Med Press),15,,485-494,,10.2147/BCTT.S412338,37484698,#1056,Brunner 2023,,,0
Preferences for Monitoring Comprehensive Heart Failure Care: A Latent Class Analysis.,Mühlbacher AC; Sadler A; Juhnke C,"OBJECTIVE: To measure preference heterogeneity for monitoring systems among patients with a chronic heart failure. METHODS: A best-worst scaling experiment (BWS case 3) was conducted among patients with chronic heart failure to assess preferences for hypothetical monitoring care scenarios. These were characterized by the attributes mobility, risk of death, risk of hospitalization, type and frequency of monitoring, risk of medical device, and system-relevant complications. A latent class analysis (LCA) was used to analyze and interpret the data. In addition, a market simulator was used to examine which treatment configurations participants in the latent classes preferred. RESULTS: Data from 278 respondents were analyzed. The LCA identified four heterogeneous classes. For class 1, the most decisive factor was mobility with a longer distance covered being most important. Class 2 respondents directed their attention toward attribute ""monitoring,"" with a preferred monitoring frequency of nine times per year. The attribute risk of hospitalization was most important for respondents of class 3, closely followed by risk of death. For class 4, however, risk of death was most important. A market simulation showed that, even with high frequency of monitoring, most classes preferred therapy with high improvement in mobility, mortality, and hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Using LCA, variations in preferences among different groups of patients with chronic heart failure were examined. This allows treatment alternatives to be adapted to individual needs of patients and patient groups. The findings of the study enhance clinical and allocative decision-making while elevating the quality of clinical data interpretation.",2024,Jan,Patient,17,1,83-95,,10.1007/s40271-023-00656-5,38017336,#517,Mühlbacher 2024,,,1
Design and Material Characterization of an Inflatable Vaginal Dilator.,Chen PH; Li YM; Morris K; Makale MT; Mayadev J; Talke FE,"There are more than 13,000 new cases of cervical cancer each year in the United States and approximately 245,000 survivors. External beam radiation and brachytherapy are the front-line treatment modalities, and 60% of patients develop vaginal damage and constriction, i.e., stenosis of the vaginal vault, greatly impeding sexual function. The incidence of vaginal stenosis (VS) following radiotherapy (RT) for anorectal cancer is 80%. VS causes serious quality of life (QoL) and psychological issues, and while standard treatment using self-administered plastic dilators is effective, acceptance and compliance are often insufficient. Based on published patient preferences, we have pursued the design of a soft inflatable dilator for treating radiotherapy-induced vaginal stenosis (VS). The critical component of the novel device is the dilator balloon wall material, which must be compliant yet able to exert therapeutic lateral force levels. We selected a commercially available silicone elastomer and characterized its stress-strain characteristics and hyperelastic properties. These parameters were quantified using uniaxial tensile testing and digital image correlation (DIC). Dilator inflation versus internal pressure was modeled and experimentally validated in order to characterize design parameters, particularly the dilator wall thickness. Our data suggest that an inflatable silicone elastomer-based vaginal dilator warrants further development in the context of a commercially available, well-tolerated, and effective device for the graded, controlled clinical management of radiotherapy-induced VS.",2024,Feb,Materials (Basel),17,5,,,10.3390/ma17051050,38473522,#341,Chen 2024,,,0
"Patients' Satisfaction with Obstetrics-Gynecology, and Pediatric Healthcare Services in Vietnam: A Multicentre Cross-Sectional Study.",Minh Hoang P; Giang LT; Tran MD,"PURPOSE: Despite improvements in maternal and child health in Vietnam, sustained efforts are required to improve healthcare quality and resolve persistent disparities, highlighting the universal significance of customer satisfaction in healthcare. This study aims to assess patient satisfaction with healthcare services and associated factors at obstetrics-gynecology and pediatric hospitals across different geographical areas in Vietnam. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2019 among 647 patients or caregivers of hospitalized children at three major obstetrics-gynecology and pediatric hospitals, representing different geographical areas in Northern Vietnam. A Ministry of Health-approved satisfaction instrument was utilized to assess patient satisfaction. The instrument included 31 items measuring five dimensions of perceived satisfaction. Exploratory factor analysis examined the construct validity of the satisfaction measurement, and multivariate linear regression determined the factors associated with patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Among the 643 participants, 520 were female (89.87%), and nearly half were aged 18-29 years old (43.7%). Factor analysis revealed three dimensions: ""Competency and Outcomes"", ""Accessibility and Procedures"", and ""Facilities and Equipment"", with mean domain scores of 4.6 ± 0.43, 4.28 ± 0.67, and 4.53 ± 0.51, respectively. The proportion of participants completely satisfied with overall service quality was 48.52%, and expectation met was 34.53%. Multivariate linear regression indicated that patients from hospitals in the Red River Delta region had higher satisfaction scores than those in the Middle region across all domains (p<0.05). Higher health insurance coverage was associated with increased satisfaction, while education level, economic status, and ethnicity also influenced satisfaction.

The Role of Web-Based Adaptive Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis Technology in Eliciting Patients' Preferences for Osteoarthritis Treatment.,Al-Omari B; Farhat J; Shraim M,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of using adaptive choice-based conjoint (ACBC) analysis to elicit patients' preferences for pharmacological treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), patients' satisfaction with completing the ACBC questionnaire, and factors associated with questionnaire completion time. METHODS: Adult patients aged 18 years and older with a medical diagnosis of OA, experiencing joint pain in the past 12 months, and living in the Northeast of England participated in the study. The participants completed a web-based ACBC questionnaire about their preferences regarding pharmaceutical treatment for OA using a touchscreen laptop independently, and accordingly, the questionnaire completion time was measured. Moreover, the participants completed a pen-and-paper feedback form about their experience in completing the ACBC questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty participants aged 40 years and older, 65% females, 75% had knee OA, and suffering from OA for more than 5 years participated in the study. About 60% of participants reported completing a computerized questionnaire in the past. About 85% of participants believed that the ACBC task helped them in making decisions regarding their OA medications, and 95% agreed or strongly agreed that they would be happy to complete a similar ACBC questionnaire in the future. The average questionnaire completion time was 16 min (range 10-24 min). The main factors associated with longer questionnaire completion time were older age, never using a computer in the past, and no previous experience in completing a questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: The ACBC analysis is a feasible and efficient method to elicit patients' preferences for pharmacological treatment of OA, which could be used in clinical settings to facilitate shared decision-making and patient-centered care. The ACBC questionnaire completion consumes a significantly longer time for elderly participants, who never used a computer, and never completed any questionnaire previously. Therefore, the contribution of patients and public involvement (PPI) group in the development of the ACBC questionnaire could facilitate participants' understanding and satisfaction with the task. Future research including patients with different chronic conditions may provide more useful information about the efficiency of ACBC analysis in eliciting patients' preferences for osteoarthritis treatment.",2023,Feb,Int J Environ Res Public Health,20,4,,,10.3390/ijerph20043364,36834057,#1517,Al-Omari 2023,,,1
Assessing Patients' Preferences for Preventive Dental Care: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,Bahanan L; Bashkail F; Alghamdi A; Alhazmy A,"Background It is crucial to recognize patients' behavioral responses to improve oral healthcare delivery. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) is typically used to measure service user preferences. The purpose of this study was to examine the preferences of the Saudi population regarding primary dental care using a DCE. Materials and methods An online DCE survey was distributed among adults aged 18 years and older living in Saudi Arabia. An orthogonal design was used to reduce the number of combinations while maintaining the main effects that reflect patient preferences. Respondents were presented with a reduced set of 10 cards (tasks), and each of the cards had two concepts (offers). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the sample characteristics. The coefficients were calculated based on discrete choice results on the Qualtrics platform. Results A total of 532 participants completed the survey. Among patients seeking a preventive dental visit, the ability to get an appointment was rated the most important influence on their decision with a relative importance of 41%, followed by the dental care provider (29%) and the dental clinic in relation to the sector and the fees (20%). The least important attribute was the waiting time in minutes, with a relative importance of 10%. Conclusion The study findings revealed that patients make trade-offs when deciding to receive primary dental care. Policymakers can use the study's findings to inform their decisions concerning dental clinic services. The study results suggest that it is possible to improve access to primary dental care by improving the accessibility of appointments.",2023,Aug,Cureus,15,8,e44028,,10.7759/cureus.44028,37746415,#965,Bahanan 2023,,,1
Patient preferences and willingness to pay for central venous access devices in breast cancer: A multicenter discrete choice experiment.,Liu S; Xiang Y; Gu Y; Chen N; Fu P; Wei Y; Zhao P; Li Y; Du C; Mu W; Xia Z; Chen Y,"BACKGROUND: Despite being a significant management decision in clinical or nursing practice, there is limited understanding of the preferences regarding risks, benefits, costs, and other attributes of patients with breast cancer when selecting peripherally inserted central catheters or totally implanted ports. The objective of this study is to investigate the preferences of patients with breast cancer who require chemotherapy when selecting an optimal central venous access device. METHODS: Data on patients' preferences for central venous access devices were collected using a face-to-face discrete choice experiment from the oncology departments of three public hospitals in China representing the eastern (Zhejiang province), central (Henan province), and western (Sichuan province) regions. The study used six attributes to describe the preferences of breast cancer patients for central venous access devices, including out-of-pocket cost, limitations in activities of daily living, catheter maintenance frequency, risk of catheter-related thrombosis, risk of catheter-related infection, and size of incision. Data were analyzed using a conditional logit model and mixed logit model. The marginal willingness to pay (mWTP) was calculated by assessing the ratio of the preference for other attributes to the preference for out-of-pocket cost. RESULTS: A total of 573 respondents completed the survey. The discrete choice experiment results showed that respondents strongly preferred a central venous access device with a catheter maintenance frequency of one time a month (vs four times a month, β = 1.188, p < 0.001), the lower risk of catheter-related thrombosis (2 % vs 10 %, β = 1.068; p < 0.001) and lower risk of catheter-related infection (2 % vs 8 % risk: β = 0.824; p < 0.001). Respondents were willing to pay CNY ¥11,968.1 (US$1776.5) for a central venous access device with a catheter maintenance frequency of one time a month rather than four times a month, ¥10,753.6 (US$1596.2) for a central venous access device with 2 % thrombosis risk over one with 10 %, and ¥8302.0 (US$1232.3) for a central venous access device with 2 % infection risk over one with 8 %. Respondents with longer travel time to the hospital, younger than 50 years old, and with urban employee basic medical insurance were willing to pay more for an improvement in the attributes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that patients with breast cancer were mainly concerned with the out-of-pocket cost, catheter maintenance frequency, risk of catheter-related thrombosis and risk of catheter-related infection when choosing a central venous access device for the delivery of chemotherapy. In clinical or nursing practice, when making central venous access device recommendation for young patients and those who live far from hospitals, totally implanted ports may be a preferable choice.",2024,Apr,Int J Nurs Stud,152,,104695,,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2024.104695,38301304,#189,Liu 2024,,,1

However, little is known about patient preferences and satisfaction and real-world prescription patterns regarding maintenance therapy for GERD. METHODS: This observational, cross-sectional, multicenter study involved patients from 18 referral hospitals in Korea. We surveyed patients who had been prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for GERD for at least 90 days with a minimum follow-up duration of 1 year. The main outcome was overall patient satisfaction with different maintenance therapy modalities. RESULTS: A total of 197 patients were enrolled. Overall patient satisfaction, patient preferences, and GERD health-related quality of life scores did not significantly differ among the maintenance therapy modality groups. However, the on-demand therapy group experienced a significantly longer disease duration than the continuous therapy group. The continuous therapy group demonstrated a lower level of awareness of potential adverse effects associated with PPIs than the on-demand therapy group but received higher doses of PPIs than the on-demand therapy group. The prescribed doses of PPIs also varied based on the phenotype of GERD, with higher doses prescribed for non-erosive reflux disease than erosive reflux disease. CONCLUSION: Although overall patient satisfaction did not significantly differ among the different PPI maintenance therapy modality groups, awareness of potential adverse effects was significantly different between the on-demand and continuous therapy groups.",2023,Oct,J Neurogastroenterol Motil,29,4,470-477,,10.5056/jnm23088,37814437,#759,Huh 2023,,,0
Physician Perspectives on Telemedicine in Radiation Oncology.,Maroongroge S; De B; Woodhouse KD; Bassett RL Jr; Lee P; Bloom ES; Smith GL; Frank SJ; Li J; Perkins G; Das P; Koong AC; Smith BD; Wang C,"PURPOSE: Telemedicine enthusiasm and uptake in radiation oncology rapidly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is unclear if and how telemedicine should be used after the COVID-19 public health emergency ends is unclear. Herein, we report on our institution's provider experience after the mature adoption of telemedicine. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We distributed a survey to all radiation oncology attending physicians at our institution in October 2021 to assess satisfaction, facilitators, and barriers to telemedicine implementation. We performed quantitative and qualitative analyses to characterize satisfaction and identify influencing factors whether telemedicine is employed. We calculated the average proportion of visits that providers expected to be appropriately performed with telemedicine for each disease site and visit type. RESULTS: A total of 60 of the 82 eligible radiation oncologists (73%) responded to the survey, of whom 78% were satisfied with telemedicine in the radiation oncology department and 83% wished to continue offering video visits after the COVID-19 public health emergency ends. Common patient factors influencing whether physicians offer telemedicine include the patient's travel burden, patient preferences, and whether a physical examination is required. Approximately 20% of new consultations and 50% of weekly management visits were estimated to be appropriate for telemedicine. The central nervous system/pediatrics and thoracic faculty considered telemedicine appropriate for the greatest proportion of new consultations, and 93% of respondents felt comfortable determining whether telemedicine was appropriate. CONCLUSIONS: Surveyed radiation oncologists were satisfied with telemedicine in their practice, and wished to continue offering video visits in the future. Our data suggest that payers should continue to support this patient-centered technology.",2023,Mar-Apr,Adv Radiat Oncol,8,2,101005,,10.1016/j.adro.2022.101005,36311822,#1483,Maroongroge 2023,,,0
Public preferences for online medical consultations in China: a discrete choice experiment.,Wang P; Huang Y; Li H; Xi X,"BACKGROUND: Online medical consultation (OMC) is significant to promote the utilization and accessibility of healthcare resources and save time on consultation. However, the usage and public acceptance rates of it are still low in China. Meanwhile, few studies have focused on consumers' demand of OMC services. This study aims to identify attributes that influence users' preference for OMC services, quantify the value of these characteristics, and compare their relative importance. METHODS: A nationwide discrete choice experiment was conducted to survey Chinese residents' preference choices for six attributes of OMC services. Conditional logit model and mixed logit model were used to analyze respondents' preference. Willingness to pay and heterogeneity were estimated by the mixed logit model. RESULTS: A total of 856 respondents completed the study, and 668 questionnaires passed the consistency test. All of 6 attributes in the study were statistically significant except for ""Doctor's professional title - Associate Senior."" When choosing OMC services, respondents preferred to spend as little time and money as possible on a large online medical platform to consult a high-rated physician with a senior title from a well-known Grade-A tertiary hospital. Besides, respondents valued doctor's evaluation score most and were willing to pay ¥107 to obtain the services of higher-scored doctors. CONCLUSION: The study measured Chinese residents' preferences for six attributes of OMC and showed the heterogeneity of attributes among subgroups. Our findings suggested that OMC services providers should reduce the customers' waiting time, improve the quality of services and enhance professional skills to meet the customers' requirements. More research on preferences for OMC needs to be conducted in China, especially for key populations such as patients with chronic diseases.",2023,,Front Public Health,11,,1282387,,10.3389/fpubh.2023.1282387,38192546,#566,Wang 2023,,,1
Safety in Teletriage by Nurses and Physicians in the United States and Israel: Narrative Review and Qualitative Study.,Haimi M; Wheeler SQ,"BACKGROUND: The safety of telemedicine in general and telephone triage (teletriage) safety in particular have been a focus of concern since the 1970s. Today, telehealth, now subsuming teletriage, has a basic structure and process intended to promote safety. However, inadequate telehealth systems may also compromise patient safety. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated rapid but uneven telehealth growth, both technologically and professionally. Within 5-10 years, the field will likely be more technologically advanced; however, these advances may still outpace professional standards. The need for an evidence-based system is crucial and urgent. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore ways that developed teletriage systems produce safe outcomes by examining key system components and questioning long-held assumptions. METHODS: We examined safety by performing a narrative review of the literature using key terms concerning patient safety in teletriage. In addition, we conducted system analysis of 2 typical formal systems, physician led and nurse led, in Israel and the United States, respectively, and evaluated those systems' respective approaches to safety. Additionally, we conducted in-depth interviews with representative physicians and 1 nurse using a qualitative approach. RESULTS: The review of literature indicated that research on various aspects of telehealth and teletriage safety is still sparse and of variable quality, producing conflicting and inconsistent results. Researchers, possibly unfamiliar with this complicated field, use an array of poorly defined terms and appear to design studies based on unfounded assumptions. The interviews with health care professionals demonstrated several challenges encountered during teletriage, mainly making diagnosis from a distance, treating unfamiliar patients, a stressful atmosphere, working alone, and technological difficulties. However, they reported using several measures that help them make accurate diagnoses and reasonable decisions, thus keeping patient safety, such as using their expertise and intuition, using structured protocols, and considering nonmedical factors and patient preferences (shared decision-making). CONCLUSIONS: Remote encounters about acute, worrisome symptoms are time sensitive, requiring decision-making under conditions of uncertainty and urgency. Patient safety and safe professional practice are extremely important in the field of teletriage, which has a high potential for error. This underregulated subspecialty lacks adequate development and substantive research on system safety. Research may commingle terminology and widely different, ill-defined groups of decision makers with wide variation in decision-making skills, clinical training, experience, and job qualifications, thereby confounding results. The rapid pace of telehealth's technological growth creates urgency in identifying safe systems to guide developers and clinicians about needed improvements.",2024,Mar,JMIR Hum Factors,11,,e50676,,10.2196/50676,38526526,#210,Haimi 2024,,,0
Perceived guideline clarity impacts guideline-concordant care for breast cancer screening in women age 40-49.,Nadler MB; Corrado AM; Wilson BE; Desnoyers A; Amir E; Ivers N; Desveaux L,"BACKGROUND: Canadian and US Task Forces recommend against routine mammography screening for women age 40-49 at average breast cancer risk as harms outweigh benefits. Both suggest individualized decisions based on the relative value women place on potential screening benefits and harms. Population-based data reveal variation in primary care professionals (PCPs) mammography rates in this age group after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, highlighting the need to explore PCP screening perspectives and how this informs clinical behaviours. Results from this study will inform interventions that can improve guideline concordant breast screening for this age group. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were performed with PCPs in Ontario, Canada. Interviews were structured using the theoretical domains framework (TDF) to explore determinants of breast cancer screening best-practice behaviours: (1) risk assessment; (2) discussion regarding benefits and harms; and (3) referral for screening. ANALYSIS: Interviews were transcribed and analyzed iteratively until saturation. Transcripts were coded deductively by behaviour and TDF domain. Data that did not fit within a TDF code were coded inductively. The research team met repeatedly to identify potential themes that influenced or were important consequences of the screening behaviours. The themes were tested against further data, disconfirming cases, and different PCP demographics. RESULTS: Eighteen physicians were interviewed. The theme of perceived guideline clarity (a lack of clarity on guideline-concordant practices) influenced all behaviours and moderated the extent to which the risk assessment and discussion occurred. Many were unaware of how risk-assessment factored into the guidelines and/or did not perceive that a shared-care discussion was guideline-concordant. Deferral to patient preference (screening referral without a complete discussion of benefits and harms) occurred when the PCPs had low knowledge regarding harms and/or if they experienced regret (TDF domain: emotion) resulting from prior clinical experiences. Older providers described patient's influence impacting their decisions and physicians trained outside Canada, practicing in higher-resourced areas, and female physicians described being influenced by beliefs about consequences of benefits of screening. CONCLUSION: Perceived guideline clarity is an important driver of physician behaviour. Improving guideline concordant care should start by clarifying the guideline itself. Thereafter, targeted strategies include building skills in identifying and overcoming emotional factors and communication skills important for evidence-based screening discussions.",2023,Feb,BMC Womens Health,23,1,75,,10.1186/s12905-023-02190-w,36803461,#1510,Nadler 2023,,,0
Advance care planning-family carer psychological distress and involvement in decision making: the ACTION trial.,Vandenbogaerde I; De Vleminck A; Cohen J; Verkissen MN; Lapeire L; Ingravallo F; Payne S; Wilcock A; Seymour J; Kars M; Grønvold M; Lunder U; Rietjens J; van der Heide A; Deliens L,"OBJECTIVES: Facilitated advance care planning (ACP) helps family carers' to be aware of patient preferences. It can improve family carers' involvement in decision making and their overall experiences at the end of life, as well as, reduce psychological stress. We investigated the effects of the ACTION Respecting Choices (RC) ACP intervention on the family carers' involvement in decision making in the last 3 months of the patients' life and on the family carers' psychological distress after 3 months of bereavement. METHODS: Over six European countries, a sample of 162 bereaved family carers returned a bereavement questionnaire. Involvement in decision making was measured with a single item of the Views of Informal Carers-Evaluation of Services Short Form questionnaire. Psychological distress was measured with the Impact of Event Scale (IES). RESULTS: No significant effect was found on family carers involvement in decision making in the last 3 months of the patients' life (95% CI 0.449 to 4.097). However, the probability of involvement in decision making was slightly higher in the intervention arm of the study (89.6% vs 86.7%; OR=1.357). Overall, no statistical difference was found between intervention and control group regarding the IES (M=34.1 (1.7) vs 31.8 (1.5); (95% CI -2.2 to 6.8)). CONCLUSION: The ACTION RC ACP intervention showed no significant effect on family carers' involvement in decision making or on subsequent psychological distress. More research is needed about (1) how family carers can be actively involved in ACP-conversations and (2) how to prepare family carers on their role in decision making.

'I feel like they're actually listening to me': a pilot study of a hospital discharge decision-making conversation guide for patients with injection drug use-associated infections.,Thakarar K; Kohut M; Stoddard H; Burris D; Chessa F; Sikka MK; Solomon DA; Kershaw CM; Eaton E; Hutchinson R; Fairfield KM; Friedmann P; Stopka TJ,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of injection drug use (IDU)-associated infections and associated hospitalizations has been increasing for nearly two decades. Due to issues ranging from ongoing substance use to peripherally inserted central catheter safety, many clinicians find discharge decision-making challenging. Typically, clinicians advise patients to remain hospitalized for several weeks for intravenous antimicrobial treatment; however, some patients may desire other antimicrobial treatment options. A structured conversation guide, delivered by infectious disease physicians, intended to inform hospital discharge decisions has the potential to enhance patient participation in decisions. We developed a conversation guide in order to: (1) investigate its feasibility and acceptability and (2) examine experiences, outcomes, and lessons learned from use of the guide. METHODS: We interviewed physicians after they each piloted the conversation guide with two patients. We interviewed patients immediately after the conversation and again 4-6 weeks later. Two analysts indexed transcriptions and used the framework method to identify and organize relevant information. We conducted retrospective chart review to corroborate and contextualize qualitative data. RESULTS: Eight patients and four infectious disease physicians piloted the conversation guide. All patients (N = 8) completed antimicrobial treatment. Nearly all participants believed the conversation guide was important for incorporating patient values and preferences. Patients reported an increased sense of autonomy, but felt post-discharge needs could be better addressed. Physician participants identified the guide's long length and inclusion of pain management as areas for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: A novel conversation guide to inform hospital discharge decision-making for patients with IDU-associated infections was feasible, acceptable, and fostered the incorporation of patient preferences and values into decisions. While we identified areas for improvement, overall participants believed that this novel conversation guide helped to improve patient care and autonomy.",2023,Jan-Dec,Ther Adv Infect Dis,10,,20499361231165108,,10.1177/20499361231165108,37034032,#1336,Thakarar 2023,,,0
Bone grafting techniques and materials for implant dentistry.,Kandhari S; Khalid S; James A; Laverty DP,"Bone quality, volume, height and width all play a pivotal role in dental implant stability, success and survival.

Shared decision making in patients with kidney failure.,Kanbay M; Basile C; Battaglia Y; Mantovani A; Yavuz F; Pizzarelli F; Luyckx VA; Covic A; Liakopoulos V; Mitra S,"'Elderly' is most commonly defined as an individual aged 65 years or older. However, this definition fails to account for the differences in genetics, lifestyle and overall health that contribute to significant heterogeneity among the elderly beyond chronological age. As the world population continues to age, the prevalence of chronic diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), is increasing and CKD frequently progresses to kidney failure. Moreover, frailty represents a multidimensional clinical entity highly prevalent in this population, which needs to be adequately assessed to inform and support medical decisions. Selecting the optimal treatment pathway for the elderly and frail kidney failure population, be it hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or conservative kidney management is complex, because of the presence of comorbidities associated with low survival rates and impaired quality of life. Management of these patients should involve a multidisciplinary approach including doctors from various specialties, nurses, psychologists, dieticians, and physiotherapists. Studies are mostly retrospective and observational, lacking adjustment for confounders or address selection and indication biases, making it difficult to use these data to guide treatment decisions. Throughout this review we discuss the difficulty of making a one-size-fits-all recommendation for the clinical needs of older patients with kidney failure. We advocate that a research agenda for optimization of the critical issues we present in this review be implemented. We recommend prospective studies that address these issues, and systematic reviews incorporating the complementary evidence of both observational and interventional studies. Furthermore, we strongly support a shared decision making process matching evidence with patient preferences to ensure that individualized choices are made regarding dialysis vs. conservative kidney management, dialysis modality, and optimal vascular access.",2023,Sep,Nephrol Dial Transplant,,,,,10.1093/ndt/gfad211,37742209,#862,Kanbay 2023,,,0
The effect of virtual reality glasses on dental anxiety during scaling and root planing in patients with periodontitis: A randomized controlled clinical trial.,Ceylan E; Gurbuz E,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of virtual reality distraction (VRD) on dental anxiety during scaling and root planing (SRP) in periodontitis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled split-mouth study included 60 patients who scored 9 or above on the dental anxiety scale (DAS) and required SRP in at least two quadrants with at least five teeth and two sites with a probing depth of ≥4 mm. Randomly chosen quadrants were treated using virtual reality glasses, and other quadrants were treated without glasses at the same visit. During VRD, a video of nature scenes was projected onto the screen in front of the patient's eyes. DAS and a visual analogue scale about patient feelings were applied at the end of the procedure. RESULTS: With VRD, the scale value of pain and discomfort level (VASP) was significantly reduced (p = 0.01, d = 0.57). Starting treatment without glasses significantly decreased VASP in both control and test sides (p = 0.00, d = 0.85; p = 0.00, d = 0.80, respectively) and increased the sensation of immersion and realism (p = 0.03, d = 0.45; p = 0.02, d = 0.46, respectively). Intraoperative and postoperative DAS values were significantly lower in patients who started treatment without VRD (p = 0.04, d = 0.34; p = 0.02, d = 0.44, respectively). Of the patients, 63.3% preferred VRD in the subsequent treatment. While patient preference did not correlate with sex, it correlated with age (r = -0.48, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The VRD and initiating SRP procedure with VRD affected the pain and discomfort level in anxious periodontitis patients. In addition, the anxiety level was also affected by starting the procedure with glasses.",2024,Mar,Int J Dent Hyg,,,,,10.1111/idh.12788,38433480,#268,Ceylan 2024,,,0

Association of Open Reduction and Internal Fixation With Volar Locking Plate for Distal Radius Fractures With Patient-Reported Outcomes in Older Adults: A Network Meta-analysis.,Jayaram M; Wood SM; Kane RL; Yang LY; Chung KC,"IMPORTANCE: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have reported inconsistent conclusions regarding optimal distal radius fracture (DRF) treatment in older adults and are limited due to the inclusion of cohort studies with small sample sizes. A network meta-analysis (NMA) addresses these limitations by only synthesizing direct and indirect evidence from RCTs and may clarify optimal DRF treatment in older adults. OBJECTIVE: To examine DRF treatment results in optimal short-term and intermediate-term patient-reported outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were conducted for RCTs that investigated DRF treatment outcomes in older adults between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2022. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials including patients with a mean age of 50 years or older that compared the following DRF treatments were eligible for inclusion: casting, open reduction and internal fixation with volar lock plating (ORIF), external fixation, percutaneous pinning, and nail fixation. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently completed all data extraction. An NMA aggregated all direct and indirect evidence among DRF treatments. Treatments were ranked by surface under the cumulative ranking curve score. Data are reported as standard mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was short-term (≤3 months) and intermediate-term (>3 months to 1 year) Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire scores. Secondary outcomes included Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) scores and 1-year complication rates. RESULTS: In this NMA, 23 RCTs consisting of 3054 participants (2495 women [81.7%]) with a mean (SD) age of 66 (7.8) years were included. At 3 months, DASH scores were significantly lower for nail fixation (SMD, -18.28; 95% CI, -29.93 to -6.63) and ORIF (SMD, -9.28; 95% CI, -13.90 to -4.66) compared with casting. The PRWE scores were also significantly lower for ORIF (SMD, -9.55; 95% CI, -15.31 to -3.79) at 3 months. In the intermediate term, ORIF was associated with lowered DASH (SMD, -3.35; 95% CI, -5.90 to -0.80) and PRWE (SMD, -2.90; 95% CI, -4.86 to -0.94) scores. One-year complication rates were comparable among all treatments. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this NMA suggest that ORIF may be associated with clinically significant improvements in short-term recovery compared with casting for multiple patient-reported outcomes measures with no increase in 1-year complication rates. Shared decision-making with patients may be useful to identify patient preferences regarding recovery to determine optimal treatment.",2023,Jun,JAMA Netw Open,6,6,e2318715,,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.18715,37326988,#1177,Jayaram 2023,,,0

A discrete choice experiment on oral and injection treatment preferences among moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients in Japan.,Komine M; Kim H; Yi J; Zhong Y; Sakai Y; Crawford B; Habiro K; Hikichi Y; Feldman SR,"Long-term psoriasis (PsO) management remains challenging. With growing variation in treatment efficacy, cost, and modes of administration, patient preferences for different treatment characteristics are not well understood. A discrete choice experiment (DCE), informed by qualitative patient interviews, was conducted to assess patient preferences for different attributes of PsO treatments; 222 adult patients with moderate-to-severe PsO receiving systemic therapy participated in the DCE web survey. Better long-term efficacy and lower cost were preferred (preference weights p < 0.05). Long-term efficacy had the highest relative importance (RI) and mode of administration was as important as the outcome attributes (efficacy and safety). Patients also preferred oral to injectable administration. In subgroup analyses by disease severity, residence, psoriatic arthritis as a comorbidity, and gender, the trends for each subgroup were the same as the overall population although the extent of RI for administration mode varied. Mode of administration was more important for patients with moderate versus severe disease, or rural versus urban residence. This DCE utilized attributes related to both oral and injectable treatment as well as a broad study population of systemic treatment users. Preferences were further stratified by patient characteristics to explore trends in different subgroups. Understanding the RI of treatment attributes and the attribute trade-offs acceptable to patients helps inform moderate-to-severe PsO systemic treatments decisions.",2023,Jun,J Dermatol,50,6,766-777,,10.1111/1346-8138.16746,36808765,#1206,Komine 2023,,,1
Indefinite Anticoagulant Therapy for First Unprovoked Venous Thromboembolism : A Cost-Effectiveness Study.,Khan F; Coyle D; Thavorn K; van Katwyk S; Tritschler T; Hutton B; Le Gal G; Rodger MA; Fergusson DA,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines recommend indefinite anticoagulation for a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE). OBJECTIVE: To estimate the benefit-harm tradeoffs of indefinite anticoagulation in patients with a first unprovoked VTE. DESIGN: Markov modeling study. DATA SOURCES: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses for the long-term risks and case-fatality rates of recurrent VTE and major bleeding. Published literature for costs, quality of life, and other clinical events. TARGET POPULATION: Patients with a first unprovoked VTE who have completed 3 to 6 months of initial anticoagulant treatment. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Canadian health care public payer. INTERVENTION: Indefinite anticoagulation with direct oral anticoagulants. OUTCOME MEASURES: Recurrent VTE events, major bleeding events, costs in 2022 Canadian dollars (CAD), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: When compared with discontinuing anticoagulation after initial treatment in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients aged 55 years, indefinite anticoagulation prevented 368 recurrent VTE events, which included 14 fatal pulmonary emboli, but induced an additional 114 major bleeding events, which included 30 intracranial hemorrhages and 11 deaths from bleeding. Indefinite anticoagulation cost CAD $16 014 more per person and did not increase QALYs (-0.075 per person). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Model results were most sensitive to the case-fatality rate of major bleeding and the annual risk for major bleeding during extended anticoagulation. LIMITATION: The model assumed that risks for recurrent VTE and major bleeding measured in clinical trials at 1 year remained constant during extended anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should use shared decision making to incorporate individual patient preferences and values when considering treatment duration for unprovoked VTE.

DESIGN: Two-arm, multi-site cluster randomized trial, assigning physicians to Intervention and Comparator arms. Patients were surveyed shortly after the visit to assess outcomes. Analyses were intention-to-treat. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Primary care physicians affiliated with 5 academic and community hospital networks and their patients aged 76-85 who were due for CRC testing and had a visit during the study period. INTERVENTIONS: Intervention arm physicians completed a 2-h online course in SDM communication skills and received an electronic reminder of patients eligible for CRC testing shortly before the visit. Comparator arm received reminders only. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was patient-reported SDM Process score (range 0-4 with higher scores indicating more SDM); secondary outcomes included patient-reported discussion of CRC screening, knowledge, intention, and satisfaction with the visit. KEY RESULTS: Sixty-seven physicians (Intervention n=34 and Comparator n=33) enrolled. Patient participants (n=466) were on average 79 years old, 50% with excellent or very good self-rated overall health, and 66% had one or more prior colonoscopies. Patients in the Intervention arm had higher SDM Process scores (adjusted mean difference 0.36 (95%CI (0.08, 0.64), p=0.01) than in the Comparator arm. More patients in the Intervention arm reported discussing CRC screening during the visit (72% vs. 60%, p=0.03) and had higher intention to follow through with their preferred approach (58.0% vs. 47.1, p=0.03). Knowledge scores and visit satisfaction did not differ significantly between arms. CONCLUSION: Physician training plus reminders were effective in increasing SDM and frequency of CRC testing discussions in an age group where SDM is essential.

Viewpoint: Nurses educating patients about drugs.,Robinson S; Adebajo A; Walker D,"Educating patients about the drugs they take is essential for them to take them safely and effectively. This education is now commonly given by nurses as part of the huge expansion in the nurse specialist role. However, training for this role has not kept pace with practice. Nurses have expressed variable confidence in this role and expressed a wish for more formal training. Current practice often puts the information rather than the patient at the centre of the consultation with the nurse dominating the conversation. Cues to address the patient agenda are commonly missed. An animated patient who interrupts is probably not having their educational needs met. Education of the professionals around how to perform this task in an optimal way is necessary and should result in better efficacy and safety of the drugs. This could be achieved by incorporating features of Shared Decision Making and the Calgary-Cambridge consultation techniques into training and the consultation. Personalisation by attention to patient preferences, language and health literacy is essential.",2023,Nov,Rheumatology (Oxford),,,,,10.1093/rheumatology/kead593,37935435,#698,Robinson 2023,,,0
"Impact of a moulded pureed diet on taste, appearance, recognisability, and overall liking among patients in an acute hospital.",Lam CJY; Phua QQ; Guo EY; Sia IKM,"INTRODUCTION: Hospital meals potentially influence patients' nutritional, physical, and emotional well-being during their admission. Patients on pureed diets report poorer meal satisfaction, due to taste, appearance, and recognisability, potentially impacting on their nutritional status. This study compared whether a moulded pureed diet made from modified maize starch led to improved taste, appearance, recognisability, and overall liking, compared to an unmoulded pureed diet made from potato starch in an acute hospital. METHODS: Patients on texture-modified diets were recruited and presented with two pureed diets - unmoulded and moulded. Participants were asked to identify meat and vegetable dishes prior to eating. After the meal, participants indicated their diet preference in terms of appearance, taste, and overall liking. RESULTS: 145 participants were recruited, of which 126 completed data collection. 86% correctly identified moulded meat dishes, 69% correctly identified moulded vegetable dishes, with an overall 77% accuracy in identifying moulded puree side dishes. On unmoulded puree side dishes, participants correctly identified 25% of meat dishes, 4% of vegetable dishes, with an overall accuracy of 14%. In terms of preference, the moulded puree was preferred, with 81% for appearance, 76% for taste and 75% for overall preference. When participants had differing preferences for appearance and taste (e.g., prefers unmoulded puree appearance and moulded puree taste), 95% of them subsequently aligned their overall preference with their taste preference (i.e., overall preferred moulded pureed diet). This suggests that taste has a stronger influence on overall preference compared to appearance. DISCUSSION: Findings indicate that a moulded pureed diet made from modified maize starch led to improved recognisability, taste, appearance, and overall liking compared to an unmoulded pureed diet made from potato starch. Taste had a stronger influence on overall preference compared to appearance. These findings capture patient preferences and may have implications on how hospital pureed diets may be improved, potentially improving patient nutrition and health outcomes.",2023,,Front Nutr,10,,1248779,,10.3389/fnut.2023.1248779,37794967,#870,LamCJY 2023,,,0
Should Antihypertensive Medications Be Routinely Administered in the Nighttime Instead of Daytime?,Patel H; Berglund F; Laffin L; Ruthmann N,"The optimal timing for administering antihypertensive medications remains a topic of debate. This review examines the effectiveness of nighttime vs daytime administration of antihypertensive medications in controlling blood pressure (BP). The MAPEC and Hygia trials suggest that nighttime dosing achieves better BP control and significantly lowers cardiovascular events. However, concerns about methodology and generalizability have been raised. In contrast, the HARMONY and TIME trials found no significant difference in BP control nor cardiovascular outcomes between daytime and nighttime dosing. Current research suggests that the timing of antihypertensive medication administration may not be a crucial factor. Therefore, the decision about the timing of antihypertensive medications administration should be individualized, taking into account patient preference and clinical context, in order to promote consistent compliance.",2023,Oct,Am J Med,136,10,975-978,,10.1016/j.amjmed.2023.06.019,37451389,#826,Patel 2023,,,0
A Preference-Based Value Assessment of the Fear of COVID-19 Contagion.,Poudel N; Ngorsuraches S,"PURPOSE: To assess the preference-based value of the fear of COVID-19 contagion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a web-based, cross-sectional discrete choice experiment among 544 US adults. We used a Bayesian efficient design to generate choice sets. Each choice set comprised two hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine options characterized by seven attributes: chance of COVID-19 infection, chance of having severe symptoms from COVID-19 infection, vaccine protection duration, chance of mild to moderate adverse events from vaccination, chance of serious adverse events from vaccination, chance of future exposure to COVID-19 after vaccination, and out-of-pocket cost. We used mixed logit (ML) and latent class (LC) models to analyze data. Furthermore, we calculated the willingness-to-pay for eliminating the chance of future exposure to COVID-19, shedding light on the value attributed to the fear of contagion. RESULTS: The ML model demonstrated all attributes, including the chance of future exposure to COVID-19, were statistically significant. The participants were willing to pay approximately $13,046 to eliminate the chance of future exposure to COVID-19 or their fear of contagion when COVID-19 was still pandemic. The LC model unveiled two participant classes with distinct preference weights for the chance of future exposure to COVID-19 and out-of-pocket cost attributes. Nevertheless, the chance of future exposure to COVID-19 exposure held a significant degree of importance in both classes. CONCLUSION: The chance of future exposure to COVID-19 exposure or fear of contagion was a significant element in the value assessment of COVID-19 vaccines. Further studies should be conducted to verify the value of fear of contagion and include it in the value assessment of healthcare technologies for infectious diseases.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,3435-3448,,10.2147/PPA.S431148,38143944,#558,Poudel 2023,,,1
Rapid implementation of remote digital primary care in Stockholm and implications for further system-wide implementation: practitioner's and manager's experience of the Always Open mobile application.,Solberg Carlsson K; Øvretveit J; Ohrling M,"OBJECTIVE: To contribute actionable knowledge how to increase appropriate use of digital technologies in primary care by understanding clinical managers experiences with a digital connection system, Always Open, during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: The overall design was a qualitative study with directed content analysis method. Data were collected from documents and focus group (n = 12) interviews with clinical managers (n = 99) of primary care. The seven domains of the Non-adoption, Abandonment, and challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) framework was used to understand the implementation process, as described by the clinical managers. RESULTS: Focus group participants reported that their units made their own local decisions to make more use of the technology provided by the health system. Most participants considered that the technology was ready to use, despite some limitations, that included individual clinician's and patient preferences, and how ready their unit was for making changes to practice and organization. Some raised concerns about how standardizing some aspects possibly conflicted with the decentralized management model of the organization. The overall experience was reported to be positive, with an intention to sustain the achievements. CONCLUSION: Focus group interviews found that clinical unit managers reported that they and their staff were positive about the digital technology system for remote care. For the future, they wanted changes to be made at different levels of the health system to better combine digital and physical care. Possibilities to use digital technology to integrate primary and hospital health care were identified.",2023,Sep,Scand J Prim Health Care,41,3,232-246,,10.1080/02813432.2023.2229387,37470469,#912,SolbergCarlsson 2023,,,0
The Ratings Game: Demographic and Practice Factors Affecting Yelp Ratings of Plastic Surgeons.,Mark EJ; Driskill EK; Fisher CT; Swinehart SV; Bradford PS; Jones M; DeGeorge BR Jr,"BACKGROUND: Review platforms such as Yelp are increasingly used by patients establishing care and may contain substantial information regarding patient preferences and potential biases. The authors' aims were to (1) analyze patient satisfaction through identifying factors associated with positive and negative patient reviews for plastic surgery providers across the United States, and (2) investigate the association between overall rating and different physician and practice factors based on gender and race. METHODS: Reviews of plastic surgery provider practices from cities across seven different regions within the United States were obtained from Yelp. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed. Chi-square tests were used to determine whether race or sex was associated with overall rating (of five stars) and qualitative themes. RESULTS: A total of 5210 reviews met inclusion criteria; 80.3% received a five-star rating and 13.5% received a one-star rating. Positive Yelp reviews and higher ratings were associated with positive comments regarding surgical and injectable outcomes, physical examination, communication, competency/knowledge base, temperament, scheduling, and staff interactions. When the following factors were mentioned negatively, the practice was more likely to receive a lower rating: temperament, communication, cost consciousness, surgical and injectable outcomes, physical examination, billing/insurance, scheduling, interactions with staff, and wait times. No association was identified in terms of overall physician rating based on sex or race; however, there were differences noted in distribution of positive and negative themes. CONCLUSIONS: Patient reviews on Yelp indicate that several physician and practice factors influence patient satisfaction. The themes reported in this study may be used by plastic surgery providers to identify areas for practice improvement to enhance the overall patient experience.",2023,Aug,Plast Reconstr Surg,152,2,463-471,,10.1097/PRS.0000000000010298,36780357,#1027,Mark 2023,,,0
ECCO Topical Review on Biological Treatment Cycles in Crohn's Disease.,Noor NM; Sousa P; Bettenworth D; Gomollón F; Lobaton T; Bossuyt P; Casanova MJ; Ding NS; Dragoni G; Furfaro F; van Rheenen PF; Chaparro M; Gisbert JP; Louis E; Papamichail K,"There are now a growing number of licensed biological therapies for patients with Crohn's disease. However, there can be significant costs associated with long-term maintenance treatment, as well as some concerns about potential side-effects. As a result, there has been increasing interest in elective biological treatment discontinuation in selected patients, after a sustained period of remission. Following discontinuation, in cases of relapse, evidence to date has suggested that remission may often be regained by re-treatment with the same biological agent. Therefore, a concept has emerged in which cycles of biological therapy might be used. If this treatment strategy were to be applied in a subgroup of patients at low risk of relapse, cycling might allow a substantial number of patients to have a lower, overall therapeutic burden-ensuring decreased exposure to biological therapy but still enabling appropriate disease control. Currently, there remains uncertainty about the benefit-risk balance for using cycles of biological treatment for patients with Crohn's disease. Accordingly, an expert panel was convened by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [ECCO] to review the published literature and agree a series of consensus practice points. The panel aimed to provide evidence-based guidance on multiple aspects of biological treatment discontinuation and cycling, including the risk of relapse after elective treatment discontinuation, predictors of probable relapse or remission, safety, patient preferences, and pharmacoeconomic aspects. Crucially, discussions about biological treatment discontinuation and cycling should be individualized, to enable shared decision-making by patients with their clinicians.",2023,Jul,J Crohns Colitis,17,7,1031-1045,,10.1093/ecco-jcc/jjad001,36626338,#1077,Noor 2023,,,0
Who Benefits From Hip Arthroplasty or Knee Arthroplasty? Preoperative Patient-reported Outcome Thresholds Predict Meaningful Improvement.,Langenberger B; Steinbeck V; Busse R,"BACKGROUND: Hip arthroplasty (HA) and knee arthroplasty (KA) are high-volume procedures. However, there is a debate about the quality of indication; that is, whether surgery is truly indicated in all patients. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) may be used to determine preoperative thresholds to differentiate patients who will likely benefit from surgery from those who will not. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What were the minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) for three commonly used PROMs in a large population of patients undergoing HA or KA treated in a general orthopaedic practice? (2) Do patients who reach the MCID differ in important ways from those who do not? (3) What preoperative PROM score thresholds best distinguish patients who achieve a meaningful improvement 12 months postsurgery from those who do not? (4) Do patients with preoperative PROM scores below thresholds still experience gains after surgery? METHODS: Between October 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020, 4182 patients undergoing HA and 3645 patients undergoing KA agreed to be part of the PROMoting Quality study and were hence included by study nurses in one of nine participating German hospitals. From a selected group of 1843 patients with HA and 1546 with KA, we derived MCIDs using the anchor-based change difference method to determine meaningful improvements. Second, we estimated which preoperative PROM score thresholds best distinguish patients who achieve an MCID from those who do not, using the preoperative PROM scores that maximized the Youden index. PROMs were Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function short form (HOOS-PS) (scored 0 to 100 points; lower indicates better health), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function short form (KOOS-PS) (scored 0 to 100 points; lower indicates better health), EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) (scored -0.661 to 1 points; higher indicates better health), and a 10-point VAS for pain (perceived pain in the joint under consideration for surgery within the past 7 days) (scored 0 to 10 points; lower indicates better health). The performance of derived thresholds is reported using the Youden index, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, geometric mean as a measure of central tendency, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: MCIDs for the EQ-5D-5L were 0.2 for HA and 0.2 for KA, with a maximum of 1 point, where higher values represented better health-related quality of life. For the pain scale, they were -0.9 for HA and -0.7 for KA, of 10 points (maximum), where lower scores represent lower pain. For the HOOS-PS, the MCID was -10, and for the KOOS-PS it was -5 of 100 points, where lower scores represent better functioning. Patients who reached the MCID differed from patients who did not reach the MCID with respect to baseline PROM scores across the evaluated PROMs and for both HA and KA. Patients who reached an MCID versus those who did not also differed regarding other aspects including education and comorbidities, but this was not consistent across PROMs and arthroplasty type. Preoperative PROM score thresholds for HA were 0.7 for EQ-5D-5L (Youden index: 0.55), 42 for HOOS-PS (Youden index: 0.27), and 3.5 for the pain scale (Youden index: 0.47). For KA, the thresholds were 0.6 for EQ-5D-5L (Youden index: 0.57), 39 for KOOS-PS (Youden index: 0.25), and 6.5 for the pain scale (Youden index: 0.40). A higher Youden index for EQ-5D-5L than for the other PROMs indicates that the thresholds for EQ-5D-5L were better for distinguishing patients who reached a meaningful improvement from those who did not. Patients who did not reach the thresholds could still achieve MCIDs, especially for functionality and the pain scale. CONCLUSION: We found that patients who experienced meaningful improvements (MCIDs) mainly differed from those who did not regarding their preoperative PROM scores. We further identified that patients undergoing HA or KA with a score above 0.7 or 0.6, respectively, on the EQ-5D-5L, below 42 or 39 on the HOOS-PS or KOOS-PS, or below 3.5 or 6.5 on a 10-point joint-specific pain scale presurgery had no meaningful benefit from surgery. The thresholds can support clinical decision-making. For example, when thresholds indicate that a meaningful improvement is not likely to be achieved after surgery, other treatment options may be prioritized. Although the thresholds can be used as support, patient preferences and medical expertise must supplement the decision. Future studies might evaluate the utility of using these thresholds in practice, examine how different thresholds can be combined as a multidimensional decision tool, and derive presurgery thresholds based on additional PROMs used in practice. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Preoperative PROM score thresholds in this study will support clinicians in decision-making through objective measures that can improve the quality of the recommendation for surgery.",2024,Feb,Clin Orthop Relat Res,,,,,10.1097/CORR.0000000000002994,38393816,#353,Langenberger 2024,,,0
Colposcopy in the Primary Health Care: A Scoping Review.,Benites-Zapata VA; Hernandez-Bustamante EA; Acuña-Chávez LM; Escudero-Gaytan CP; Ulloque-Badaracco JR; Alarcón-Braga EA; Venegas G; Herrera-Añazco P,"AIM: Low- and middle-income countries represent nearly 85% of all cervical cancer cases worldwide; thereby, it is extremely important to identify methods to improve the screening process. Therefore, this study aimed to summarize the primary characteristics of studies on accessibility, coverage, patient preferences, and factors associated with patient satisfaction or acceptance of colposcopy in primary healthcare. METHODS: A search strategy, based on MeSH, Emtree, and free terms, was run through 5 databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Ovid/Medline, and Web of Science). EndNote 20.1 © and Rayyan QCRI © were used for screening. A preset datasheet was used for data extraction. RESULTS: The systematic search retrieved 1127 references, and after removing duplicates, screening the titles and abstracts, and reviewing the full text, 7 studies were included. The interrater reliability was 77.73% (kappa statistic = 0.1842). Most studies estimated the proportion of women that sought for colposcopy after a previous screening test for human papilloma virus. One study identifies barriers to colposcopy examination in women at risk of developing cervical cancer. Three studies assessed the decentralization of colposcopy from a tertiary healthcare center to a primary care center. Pap smear was the most common first-line screening test, followed by liquid-based cytology sample and visual inspection with acetic acid. CONCLUSION: Only a few countries have investigated the use of colposcopy in primary care. Thus, barriers and the care structure for this implementation to be successful in reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality should be identified.",2023,Jan-Dec,J Prim Care Community Health,14,,21501319231198942,,10.1177/21501319231198942,37740513,#1613,Benites-Zapata 2023,,,0
Patient preferences and decision-making when considering surgery for musculoskeletal disorders: A mixed methods systematic review.,Healy S; Dorflinger E; Michaleff ZA; Marks D,"INTRODUCTION: The burden of Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) is large. Surgery is an important management option but the factors that shape patients' surgical decisions are not well understood. As prior reviews have explored only single data types or conditions, a mixed methods appraisal across the musculoskeletal spectrum was undertaken. METHODS: A mixed-methods systematic, convergent segregated approach was used, with PubMed, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINHAL), Embase and PsycINFO searched to identify studies of adult patients' decisions about whether to undergo surgery. A narrative synthesis was conducted, with identified themes integrated across quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies. RESULTS: Forty-six studies were included (24 quantitative, 19 qualitative and three mixed methods), with four decision-making themes identified (symptoms, sociodemographic and health factors, information and perceptions). Decision-making involves a complex interaction of individual sociodemographic, health and symptom information, integrated with individual perceptions of candidacy and surgical expectations. While most studies investigated hip and knee surgery, across all included conditions, patients are more likely to favour surgery if symptoms and/or dysfunction are higher, and if perceptions of surgical candidacy and processes (outcomes, inconvenience, and risk) are favourable. Other factors including age, general health, race, financial context, professional and non-professional communication, and information sources also impact decision-making but exert a less consistent impact upon the propensity to prefer surgery. CONCLUSION: Patients are more likely to choose surgery for MSD when they have higher levels of symptoms or dysfunction and positive perceptions of surgical suitability and expectations. Other factors important to individuals, have a less consistent impact upon the propensity to prefer surgery. These findings have potential to aid the efficient referral of patients to orthopaedics. More research is needed to validate these findings across the spectrum of MSD.",2023,Jun,Musculoskeletal Care,21,2,312-337,,10.1002/msc.1705,37316969,#1178,Healy 2023,,,1
Neck Rejuvenation.,Pérez P; Hohman MH,"A common complaint of patients presenting for facial cosmetic evaluation is the appearance of aging in the neck. Specifically, vertical lines visible at the medial borders of the platysma muscles - known as platysmal bands - accumulation of fat in the submental area, and effacement of the cervicomental angle are frequently mentioned. Multiple options with varying degrees of invasiveness are available to address these concerns, such as neck lift with or without platysmaplasty, submental liposuction, deoxycholic acid injection, cryotherapy, botulinum toxin injection, and skin resurfacing, among others. Determining the appropriate treatment modality will depend on patient preference and goals, budget, general health, and underlying anatomy. Frequently, these procedures will be combined with other interventions, like face lifting and blepharoplasty, or dermal filler injections. Surgeons will often need to pair with allied healthcare personnel, such as injection nurses and aestheticians, in order to maximize patients' results and satisfaction.",2024,Jan,,,,,,,32965900,#542,Pérez 2024,,,0
Dietetic advocacy for long-term use of exclusive enteral nutrition resulted in high-risk surgical avoidance for complicated fibrotic Crohn's disease - A case report.,Purcell L; McIvor C; Palmer M,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Surgery is often the only therapeutic option for the management of fibrotic Crohn's disease (FCD). Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN), a nutritionally complete liquid formula, is an effective, safe, short-term treatment for Crohn's Disease. No cases were found internationally of adults with FCD on long-term EEN. We report on clinical outcomes and self-reported quality of life (QoL) after longer-term EEN provision in a patient with complex FCD. METHODS: ""Billie"", a 54-year-old female, was admitted with ileal FCD diagnosed in 1985. Previous treatments were unsuccessful, including multiple bowel resections. Billie was chronically bedbound with pain and depression. CDAI (Crohn's disease activity index) score was 640 (<150) with ∼3-20 liquid stools/day, and recurrent partial bowel obstructions. Radiological findings were so severe surgeons reluctantly considered surgery but ""one more resection will result in short bowel syndrome"". Billie trialled EEN given her QoL was ""non-existent"". Unable to tolerate the taste, EEN was administered via nasogastric tube. After two months, EEN was administered ongoing via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy given patient preference and dietetic advocacy. RESULTS: After eight weeks on EEN, Billie's pain predominantly resolved, with bowel motions of ∼1-2/day, and nil bowel obstructions. Twelve months after EEN commencement, Billie's CDAI was 52, with 'no indication for surgical intervention' and was self-reporting that ""life is good"". After 18 months, Billie remains asymptomatic, and in clinical remission. CONCLUSION: This unique case is a wonderful example of dietetic advocacy and showcases the positive impact long-term EEN may have on surgical avoidance, clinical outcomes and self-reported QoL.",2023,Oct,Clin Nutr ESPEN,57,,1-4,,10.1016/j.clnesp.2023.06.001,37739642,#813,Purcell 2023,,,0
Outcomes that matter most to burn patients: A national multicentre survey study in the Netherlands.,Spronk I; van Uden D; van Dammen L; van Baar ME; Nieuwenhuis M; Pijpe A; Visser I; van Schie C; van Zuijlen P; Haanstra T; Lansdorp CA,"BACKGROUND: The use of patient-reported outcomes to improve burn care increases. Little is known on burn patients' views on what outcomes are most important, and about preferences regarding online Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). Therefore, this study assessed what outcomes matter most to patients, and gained insights into patient preferences towards the use of online PROMs. METHODS: Adult patients (≥18 years old), 3-36 months after injury completed a survey measuring importance of outcomes, separately for three time periods: during admission, short-term (<6 months) and long-term (6-24 months) after burn injury. Both open and closed-ended questions were used. Furthermore, preferences regarding the use of patient-reported outcome measures in burn care were queried. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients were included (response rate: 27%). 'Not having pain' and 'good wound healing' were identified as very important outcomes. Also, 'physical functioning at pre-injury level', 'being independent' and 'taking care of yourself' were considered very important outcomes. The top-ten of most important outcomes largely overlapped in all three time periods. Most patients (84%) had no problems with online questionnaires, and many (67%) indicated that it should take up to 15 minutes. Patients' opinions differed widely on the preferred frequency of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Not having pain and good wound healing were considered very important during the whole recovery of burns; in addition, physical functioning at pre-injury level, being independent, and taking care of yourself were deemed very important in the short and long-term. These outcomes are recommended to be used in burn care and research, although careful selection of outcomes remains crucial as patients prefer online questionnaires up to 15 minutes.",2024,Feb,Burns,50,1,31-40,,10.1016/j.burns.2023.10.018,37985268,#425,Spronk 2024,,,0

Patient and researcher stakeholder preferences for use of electronic health record data: a qualitative study to guide the design and development of a platform to honor patient preferences.,Morse B; Kim KK; Xu Z; Matsumoto CG; Schilling LM; Ohno-Machado L; Mak SS; Keller MS,"OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study aimed to understand patient and researcher perspectives regarding consent and data-sharing preferences for research and a patient-centered system to manage consent and data-sharing preferences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted focus groups with patient and researcher participants recruited from three academic health centers via snowball sampling. Discussions focused on perspectives on the use of electronic health record (EHR) data for research. Themes were identified through consensus coding, starting from an exploratory framework. RESULTS: We held two focus groups with patients (n = 12 patients) and two with researchers (n = 8 researchers). We identified two patient themes (1-2), one theme common to patients and researchers (3), and two researcher themes (4-5). Themes included (1) motivations for sharing EHR data, (2) perspectives on the importance of data-sharing transparency, (3) individual control of personal EHR data sharing, (4) how EHR data benefits research, and (5) challenges researchers face using EHR data. DISCUSSION: Patients expressed a tension between the benefits of their data being used in studies to benefit themselves/others and avoiding risk by limiting data access. Patients resolved this tension by acknowledging they would often share their data but wanted greater transparency on its use. Researchers expressed concern about incorporating bias into datasets if patients opted out. CONCLUSIONS: A research consent and data-sharing platform must consider two competing goals: empowering patients to have more control over their data and maintaining the integrity of secondary data sources. Health systems and researchers should increase trust-building efforts with patients to engender trust in data access and use.",2023,May,J Am Med Inform Assoc,30,6,1137-49,,10.1093/jamia/ocad058,37141581,#1250,Morse 2023,,,0
Effects of an interactive web-based support system via mobile phone on preference-based patient participation in patients living with hypertension - a randomized controlled trial in primary care.,Vestala H; Bendtsen M; Midlöv P; Kjellgren K; Eldh AC,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effects of an interactive web-based support system via mobile phone on preference-based patient participation in patients with hypertension treated in primary care (compared with standard hypertensive care only). DESIGN: A parallel group, non-blinded, randomized controlled trial, conducted October 2018-February 2021. Besides standard hypertensive care, the intervention group received eight weeks of support via mobile phone to facilitate self-monitoring and self-management, tentatively providing for augmented patient engagement. SETTING: 31 primary healthcare centers in Sweden. SUBJECTS: 949 patients treated for hypertension. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The effects on preference-based patient participation, that is, the match between a patient's preferences for and experiences of patient participation in their health and healthcare. This was measured with the 4Ps (Patient Preferences for Patient Participation) tool at baseline, after 8 weeks, and at 12 months. Data were registered electronically and analyzed with multilevel ordinal regression. RESULTS: At baseline, 43-51% had a complete match between their preferences for and experiences of patient participation. There was an indication of a positive effect by a higher match for 'managing treatment myself' at 8-weeks in the intervention group. Such preference-based participation in their health and healthcare was reversed at 12 months, and no further effects of the intervention on preference-based patient participation persisted after 12 months. CONCLUSION: The interactive web-based support system via mobile phone had a wavering effect on preference-based patient participation.

Patient preferences in treatment options of ulcerative colitis: a discrete choice experiment.,Straatmijer T; van den Akker-van Marle ME; Ponsioen CY; van der Horst D; Scherpenzeel MP; Duijvestein M; van der Meulen-de Jong AE,"INTRODUCTION: Since the number of medical treatment options for Ulcerative Colitis (UC) has expanded over the last decades, patients and physicians face challenges regarding decisions about the medication options. We aimed to identify patients' preferences about their UC treatment options in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we assessed after how many failed treatment options, patients are willing to consider surgical treatment. METHODS: We conducted a web-based, multicenter, discrete choice experiment (DCE) among adult UC patients. Patients were repeatedly asked to choose between two hypothetical medicinal treatment options. The choice tasks were based on administration route, administration location, chance of symptom reduction (on short and long term) and chances on infection and other adverse events. Data were analyzed by using Hierarchical Bayes estimation. RESULTS: A total of 172 UC patients participated in the DCE. More than half were anti-TNF experienced (52.9%). The chance of symptom reduction after one year (relative importance (RI) 27.7 (95% CI 26.0-29.4)) was most important in choosing between medicinal treatments, followed by the chance of infection (RI 22.3 (21.4 - 23.3)) and chance of symptom reduction after eight weeks (RI 19.5 (18.3 - 20.6)). Considering surgical treatment, nineteen patients (14.3%) would not even consider surgery after failing eight treatment options without any new available therapies left. Nine patients would consider surgery before trying any treatment options. CONCLUSION: We found that symptom reduction after one year was the most important attribute in choosing between treatments in UC patients. These outcomes can help understand the trade-offs and preferences of UC patients.",2024,Mar,Scand J Gastroenterol,59,3,288-295,,10.1080/00365521.2023.2286191,38042982,#307,Straatmijer 2024,,,1
Patient Perception of Physician Attire Before and After the COVID-19 Global Pandemic Began.,Hedges MS; Tolaymat LM; Haskell NK; Prier C; Walker AL; Haga C; Li Z; Yin M; McManus M; Dawson N,"Introduction: This study evaluated patient preference of physician attire both before and after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic began. The primary outcome was patient preference of physician attire in 2017 compared to 2022 survey cohorts. Methods: An observational cross-sectional study performed at a single-site academic institution in the United States using patient survey materials. In total, 339 patients were included in the study, 161 from 2017 and 178 from 2022. Key Points: There was a statistically significant decrease in patient preference for formal attire in the clinical settings of primary care, hospital, and overall. Male patient preference for formal attire declined in primary care, emergency room, and overall; whereas female patient preference for formal attire declined in the hospital setting.

Incorporating Prior Data in Quantitative Benefit-Risk Assessments: Case Study of a Bayesian Method.,Dharmarajan S; Yuan Z; Chen YF; Lackey L; Mukhopadhyay S; Singh P; Tiwari R,"BACKGROUND: Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) in their current implementation cannot incorporate prior or external information on benefits and risks. We demonstrate how to incorporate prior data using a Bayesian mixture model approach while conducting quantitative benefit-risk assessments (qBRA) for medical products. METHODS: We implemented MCDA and SMAA in a Bayesian framework. To incorporate information from a prior study, we use mixture priors on each benefit and risk attribute that mixes information from a previous study with a vague prior distribution. The degree of borrowing is varied using a mixing proportion parameter. RESULTS: A demonstration case study for qBRA using the supplementary New Drug Application (sNDA) filing for Rivaroxaban for the indication of reduction in the risk of major thrombotic vascular events in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) was used to illustrate the method. Net utility scores, obtained from the randomized controlled trial data to support the sNDA, from the MCDA for Rivaraxoban and comparator were 0.48 and 0.56, respectively, with Rivaroxaban being the preferred alternative only 33% of the time. We show that with only 30% borrowing from a previous RCT, the MCDA and SMAA results are favorable for Rivaroxaban, accounting for the seemingly aberrant results on all-cause death in the trial data used to support the sNDA. CONCLUSION: Our method to formally incorporate prior data in MCDA and SMAA is easy to use and interpret.

Sentiment analysis of pain physician reviews on Healthgrades: a physician review website.,Cheng CP; Owusu T; Shekane P; Patel AM,"INTRODUCTION: There are currently no published studies using patient reviews of pain physicians to quantitatively assess patient preferences for pain physician attributes. The aim of the present study was to use natural language processing to quantitatively analyze patient reviews of pain physicians by determining the effect of physician demographics and word frequency on positive review outcomes. METHODS: Using a peer-reviewed algorithm, online Healthgrades reviews of pain physicians practicing in the USA were scored according to their positive sentiment from -1 to 1. These sentiment scores and star ratings were used to compare physicians by age, gender and region of practice. Frequency analysis of words and bigrams was performed for all reviews. RESULTS: There were 15 101 reviews collected among 1275 pain physicians which showed male physicians received higher star ratings and review sentiment scores than female physicians. Pain physicians younger than 55 years received higher star ratings and sentiment scores than those of 55 years and older. Frequency analysis revealed that words most commonly used in the more positive patient reviews included 'care', 'professional', 'patient', 'help' and 'kind'; the words most commonly used in less positive reviews included 'pain', 'back', 'office', 'time' and 'years'. CONCLUSIONS: Male and/or younger pain physicians receive more positive reviews. Patients highly rate pain physicians who are perceived as personable. Patients lowly rate physicians who are perceived as providing ineffective treatment of their pain as well as when they experience barriers to their access to care.",2023,Jul,Reg Anesth Pain Med,,,,,10.1136/rapm-2023-104650,37451825,#1062,Cheng 2023,,,0

A qualitative exploration of allied health providers' perspectives on cultural humility in palliative and end-of-life care.,Singh H; Haghayegh AT; Shah R; Cheung L; Wijekoon S; Reel K; Sangrar R,"BACKGROUND: Cultural factors, including religious or cultural beliefs, shape patients' death and dying experiences, including palliative and end-of-life (EOL) care preferences. Allied health providers must understand their patients' cultural preferences to support them in palliative and EOL care effectively. Cultural humility is a practice which requires allied health providers to evaluate their own values, biases, and assumptions and be open to learning from others, which may enhance cross-cultural interactions by allowing providers to understand patients' perceptions of and preferences for their health, illness, and dying. However, there is limited knowledge of how allied health providers apply cultural humility in palliative and EOL care within a Canadian context. Thus, this study describes Canadian allied health providers' perspectives of cultural humility practice in palliative and EOL care settings, including how they understand the concept and practice of cultural humility, and navigate relationships with patients who are palliative or at EOL and from diverse cultural backgrounds. METHODS: In this qualitative interpretive description study, remote interviews were conducted with allied health providers who currently or recently practiced in a Canadian palliative or EOL care setting. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using interpretive descriptive analysis techniques. RESULTS: Eleven allied health providers from the following disciplines participated: speech-language pathology, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and dietetics. Three themes were identified: (1) Interpreting and understanding of cultural humility in palliative and EOL care (i.e., recognizing positionality, biases and preconceived notions and learning from patients); (2) Values, conflicts, and ethical uncertainties when practicing cultural humility at EOL between provider and patient and family, and within the team and constraints/biases within the system preventing culturally humble practices; (3) The 'how to' of cultural humility in palliative and EOL care (i.e., ethical decision-making in palliative and EOL care, complexities within the care team, and conflicts and challenges due to contextual/system-level factors). CONCLUSIONS: Allied health providers used various strategies to manage relationships with patients and practice cultural humility, including intra- and inter-personal strategies, and contextual/health systems enablers. Conflicts and challenges they encountered related to cultural humility practices may be addressed through relational or health system strategies, including professional development and decision-making support.",2023,Jul,BMC Palliat Care,22,1,92,,10.1186/s12904-023-01214-4,37434238,#1067,Singh 2023,,,0
Patient perspectives on teledentistry and face-to-face doctor interaction during orthodontic treatment.,Griffeth JK; Shroff B; Carrico C; Cook P; Lindauer SJ,"INTRODUCTION: Teledentistry in orthodontics is growing, yet patient preferences for its use is unknown. This study aimed to determine the perceived value of doctor-to-patient face-to-face interaction, convenience, and attitudes toward specific uses of teledentistry among orthodontic patients. METHODS: Private practice orthodontists emailed an electronic survey to active patients. Patients aged ≥18 years completed the survey regarding their treatment. Parents of patients aged <18 years completed a separate survey regarding their child's treatment. Responses were compared on the basis of patient characteristics (adult vs child, braces vs clear aligners, etc). RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-seven respondents from 8 orthodontic practices participated in the survey. Eighty-five percent of parents considered face-to-face interaction important, and 85% said that their child's treatment fit conveniently into their schedule. Adult responses were 86% and 89%, respectively. Adult preference for face-to-face was significantly higher than parents of adolescent patients (83% vs 78%; P = 0.038). Adults treated with clear aligners were less likely to strongly agree that their treatment fitted conveniently in their schedule (51% vs 76% in braces; P = 0.0490) and were more likely to be interested in using teledentistry (27% vs 18% in braces; P = 0.0429). CONCLUSIONS: Most orthodontic patients prefer to be seen face-to-face. This is due to the high value placed on face-to-face interaction with the orthodontist. Most patients do not consider their treatment inconvenient. Patients prefer that teledentistry be used to enhance communication as opposed to replacing face-to-face interaction. Implementing teledentistry in orthodontics should be applied on a patient-to-patient basis with continued emphasis on the doctor-patient relationship.",2023,Mar,Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop,163,3,328-337,,10.1016/j.ajodo.2021.11.019,36411229,#1476,Griffeth 2023,,,0
Lifetime Management of Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis in the Era of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,Jubran A; Patel RV; Sathananthan J; Wijeysundera HC,"Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular disease. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) using mechanical valves has been the preferred treatment for younger patients, but bioprosthetic valves are gaining favour to avoid anticoagulation with warfarin. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was approved in recent years for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis in intermediate- and low-risk patients as an alternative to SAVR. The longer life expectancy of these groups of patients might exceed the durability of the TAVR or SAVR bioprosthetic valves. Therefore, many patients need 2 or even 3 interventions during their lifetime. Because it has important implications on the feasibility of subsequent procedures, the decision between opting for SAVR or TAVR as the primary procedure requires thorough consideration by the heart team, incorporating patient preferences, clinical indicators, and anatomic aspects. If TAVR is favoured initially, selecting the valve type and determining the implantation level should be conducted, aiming for positive outcomes in the index intervention and keeping in mind the potential for subsequent TAVR-in-TAVR procedures. When SAVR is selected as the primary procedure, the operator must make choices regarding the valve type and the potential need for aortic root enlargement, with the intention of facilitating future valve-in-valve interventions. This narrative review examines the existing evidence concerning the lifelong management of severe aortic stenosis, delving into available treatment strategies, particularly emphasising the initial procedure's selection and its impact on subsequent interventions.",2024,Feb,Can J Cardiol,40,2,210-217,,10.1016/j.cjca.2023.09.010,37716642,#435,Jubran 2024,,,0
Factors influencing gender preference towards surgeons among Jordanian adults: an investigation of healthcare bias.,AlSamhori JF; Rayyan R; Hammouri M; Taha H; Al-Huneidy L; AlOweiwi W; AlMohtasib J; Mansour S; Dardas M; Qiqieh J; Halasa Z; Al-Huneidy Y; Al-Ani A,"Studies investigating gender bias against female surgeons yielded conflicting results ranging from neutrality to a clear preference towards male surgeons. Yet, such bias remains understudied within Middle Eastern nations. We aimed to assess preferences of surgeons' gender among Jordanians and explore reasons for possible gender bias across different surgical specialties. A total of 1708 respondents were examined using a cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire to evaluate the gender preferences of surgeons, characteristics associated with preferred surgeon's gender, and surgeon's preference in certain specialties. Nearly 52.0% of participants had no gender preference for surgeons. Among those with a preference, 75.7% preferred male surgeons while 24.3% preferred female surgeons. Reputation, knowledge, and experience were the most important factors when choosing a surgeon. Male surgeons were viewed as more trustworthy, knowledgeable, experienced, and communicative. Female surgeons were dominantly perceived as more compassionate, cooperative, and prone to listen. Male respondents were 5 times more likely to choose a surgeon of similar gender (OR 5.687; CI 3.791-8.531). Male surgeons were favored for cardiovascular and orthopedic surgeries. Similarly, female surgeons were favored in gynecological and obstetric surgeries, plastic surgeries, and breast surgeries. Female gender (OR 6.193; CI 4.077-9.408), living outside Amman (OR 1.517; CI 1.066-2.160), and being married (OR 2.504; CI 1.601-3.917) were all significant positive predictors of preferring female surgeons. Our findings highlight differences in gender preference and perception of surgeons among Jordanian adults.",2023,Jul,Sci Rep,13,1,11614,,10.1038/s41598-023-38734-1,37464087,#1053,AlSamhori 2023,,,0
Implementing telemedicine in urogynecology: A feasibility study.,D'Almeida Lucas Macharet DV; Mendes LN; Pereira GMV; de Castro Monteiro MV,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Telemedicine has been recommended for the management of urogynecological conditions during the coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of telemedicine for urogynecology at a Brazilian public hospital. METHODS: A descriptive observational study was performed at a urogynecology outpatient clinic. The primary outcome was the desire to continue with telemedicine. Secondary outcomes were appointment resolvability, technical aspects of the appointment, and patient satisfaction. The participants had in-person appointments that were canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected data on sociodemographic characteristics and clinical and technical aspects of the appointments. The participants responded to satisfaction questionnaires 7-15 days post-procedure. The categorical variables were evaluated based on absolute and relative frequency. The continuous variables were described as the mean and standard deviation. A chi-square test was performed to determine the association between variables. RESULTS: In total, 225 patients had appointments canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, of which 171 were eligible for the study. Telemedicine appointments were agreed upon by 48% of the participants and 85.5% responded to the satisfaction survey. We found that 57.7% of the participants desired to continue with telemedicine. The appointment resolvability rate was 76.1%, 63.4% of the appointments met the technical criteria, and the satisfaction rate was 93%. The only variable associated with the desire to continue telemedicine was overall patient satisfaction (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine in urogynecology is feasible and can be implemented in the studied population. However, actions are essential to adequately support patient preference and improve the acceptance of telemedicine.",2023,Jul,Int Urogynecol J,34,7,1487-1493,,10.1007/s00192-022-05392-2,36331581,#1139,D'AlmeidaLucasMacharet 2023,,,0

The purpose of this study is to compare clinical results, perceived range of motion, and overall implant preference among patients who had undergone staged bilateral knee replacement with an APT and contralateral knee replacement with MBTs. A dataset of 62 patients from a single centre who underwent staged bilateral TKA between 2009 and 2022 was selected and retrospectively analysed. Tibial component removal was performed in three knees overall, all of which had MBTs. The mean measured Knee Score (KS) of knees with APTs was 78.37 and that of contralateral knees with MBTs was 77.4. The mean measured Function (FS) of knees with APTs was 78.22, and that of contralateral knees with MBs was 76.29. The mean flexion angle of knees with APTs was 103.8 and that for knees with MBTs was 101.04 degrees. A total of 54.8% of the patients preferred the knee that received APTs over contralateral MBTs.

"Changes in thyroid function in prostate cancer patients receiving docetaxel chemotherapy at Haji Adam Malik Hospital, Indonesia.",Firman A; Warli SM; Sihombing B; Lelo A; Indharty RS; Nasution IPA; Muhar AM,"BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer treatment is determined based on several factors, namely tumor grading, staging, co-morbidity, patient preferences, life expectancy at diagnosis. Today, taxanes are commonly prescribed to treat several types of cancer and have been shown to have antitumor effects in many cancers. This research has never been done in prostate cancer patients but similar studies have been done before in breast cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research design was observational analytic where this type of research was a prospective cohort where data was collected to record prostate cancer patients who received docetaxel chemotherapy which were then examined for thyroid function in cancer patients at the Adam Malik Hospital, Medan, Indonesia. RESULT: In this study, data were collected regarding the thyroid function of the study sample in the form of free thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels before chemotherapy with the docetaxel regimen. The mean of fT4 in all research subjects was 1.05 with a standard deviation of 0.26. The mean TSH in all study subjects was 1.52 with a standard deviation of 1.21. Thyroid function was examined after 3 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy. The mean of fT4 in all research subjects was 0.91 with a standard deviation of 0.23. The mean TSH in all study subjects was 1.69 with a standard deviation of 1.09.

Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Situ of the Nail Unit: Current Evidence and Recommendations for Patient Centered Treatment.,Barone H; Schaeffer M; Buckland M; LaFond AA; Krach K,"Squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the hand and nail is an infrequent tumor but represents the majority of hand and nail malignancies. While the conventional treatments of invasive nail unit squamous cell carcinoma include Mohs micrographic surgery, wide local excision, or distal digit amputation, no standardized management paradigm for in situ disease exists and the necessity of surgical options is debated. This review aims to discuss the most commonly reported treatment methods and critically assess relevant management considerations in order to facilitate appropriate treatment decisions for nail unit SCCis across dermatologic practice settings. Assessment of the current literature reveals insufficient evidence to determine a standardized treatment for nail unit squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Rather, management is greatly impacted by multiple factors including the presence of subungual involvement, surgical candidacy, importance of curative treatment, and patient preferences regarding cosmesis and function versus cure. When cure is desired, Mohs micrographic surgery is the treatment of choice in most cases. In the setting of desired curative intent, but poor surgical candidacy, radiotherapy may be effective and provide a reasonable chance of functional and cosmetic preservation. Other methods including photodynamic therapy, electrodesiccation and curettage, cryotherapy, and intralesional chemotherapeutics may be appropriate in specific circumstances, but are generally limited by lack of evidence or impracticalities. Lastly, observation with palliation may be appropriate when considering exceedingly rare disease-related mortality.",2023,Jan-Feb,J Cutan Med Surg,27,1,51-59,,10.1177/12034754221134226,36285750,#1647,Barone 2023,,,0
Health-related quality of life in early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma: a longitudinal analysis of the ABVD arm in the randomized controlled trial HD.6.,Mian H; Ringash J; Meyer R; Hay AE; Shepherd L; Djurfeldt M; Winter JN; Sussman J; Pater J; Chen BE; Prica A,"Early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma has become one of the most curable hematologic malignancies. Depending upon the disease location, possible toxicities, and patient preference, chemotherapy alone with ABVD remains an accepted treatment modality for this disease. There remains a paucity of data regarding the longitudinal trajectory of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients treated for HL. The impact of disease and treatment on HRQoL is increasingly important to understand as the number of long-term survivors increases. We report the longitudinal HRQoL using data prospectively collected from diagnosis up to 10 years post-treatment in the ABVD arm of the HD.6 randomized controlled trial for early-stage HL patients (N=169). We analyzed HRQoL using the EORTC QLQ-C30 collected at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after completion of chemotherapy and yearly up to year 10. Clinically and statistically significant improvements were noted for specific domains including emotional (3 months post-treatment), social (12 months post-treatment) and financial functioning (2 years post-treatment), and the specific symptom of fatigue (6 months post-treatment) during the follow-up period. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective, longitudinal analysis of HRQoL specifically among patients with early-stage HL treated with ABVD therapy alone. Although improvements were noted, sustained clinically and statistically significant improvements were noted only in select symptoms emphasizing the need to better understand and optimize HRQoL among this patient group.",2023,Apr,Support Care Cancer,31,5,256,,10.1007/s00520-023-07717-3,37043087,#1328,Mian 2023,,,0
Quantifying stakeholders' preference for implantable medical devices in China: a discrete choice experiment.,Wan B; Shen J; Chen J; Weng L; Zhao P; Deng Y; Zhang L; Zhang F; Wang Y; Li X; Chang F; Ding H; Lu Y,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to gain insight into each attribute as presented in the value of implantable medical devices, quantify attributes' strength and their relative importance, and identify the determinants of stakeholders' preferences. METHODS: A mixed-methods design was used to identify attributes and levels reflecting stakeholders' preference toward the value of implantable medical devices. This design combined literature reviewing, expert's consultation, one-on-one interactions with stakeholders, and a pilot testing. Based on the design, six attributes and their levels were settled. Among 144 hypothetical profiles, 30 optimal choice sets were developed, and healthcare professionals (decision-makers, health technology assessment experts, hospital administrators, medical doctors) and patients as stakeholders in China were surveyed. A total of 134 respondents participated in the survey. Results were analyzed by mixed logit model and conditional logit model. RESULTS: The results of the mixed logit model showed that all the six attributes had a significant impact on respondents' choices on implantable medical devices. Respondents were willing to pay the highest for medical devices that provided improvements in clinical safety, followed by increased clinical effectiveness, technology for treating severe diseases, improved implement capacity, and innovative technology (without substitutes).

The Impact of Substantial Improvements in HbA1c and Weight Loss on the Medication Preferences of People with Type 2 Diabetes.,Gelhorn HL; Osumili B; Brown K; Ross MM; Schulz A; Fernandez G; Boye KS,"PURPOSE: To quantify the preferences of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) for treatment attributes of a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) versus an injectable GLP-1 RA medication profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Injection-naive people taking oral medications for T2D in the US and UK completed a web survey including a discrete choice experiment to quantify patients' preferences for five treatment attributes: delivery system, frequency of nausea, frequency of hypoglycemia, HbA1c reduction, and weight reduction. Attributes and levels were based on head-to-head clinical trial data of tirzepatide 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg versus semaglutide 1mg. Preference data were analyzed separately by country using multinomial mixed logit (MXL) models. MXL parameters were used to estimate the predicted preference for each tirzepatide dose versus semaglutide 1mg. Direct preferences for each dose of tirzepatide versus semaglutide 1mg were elicited. RESULTS: Participants (N=620) in the US (N=301) and UK (N=319) were 50.8% and 50.5% female with mean ages of 60.7 years and 58.9 years, respectively. The order and magnitude of relative attribute importance (RAI) scores differed between countries. HbA1c reduction (26.3%) had the greatest impact on US participants' preferences, and hypoglycemia (32.8%) did among UK participants. Attribute-level marginal utility results indicated preferences for greater HbA1c improvements, the single-use pre-filled pen, lower hypoglycemia, greater weight reductions, and lower frequency of nausea. Assuming the availability of only tirzepatide or semaglutide 1mg, the predicted preference for tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15mg) in the US is 95.6% (vs 4.4% for semaglutide 1mg) and in the UK was 86.3% (vs 13.7% for semaglutide 1mg). CONCLUSION: HbA1c reduction, frequency of hypoglycemia, and weight reduction are key drivers of preferences among people with T2D when considering medication options. Overall, people with T2D are likely to prefer the tirzepatide over the semaglutide 1mg medication profiles.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,793-805,,10.2147/PPA.S401465,36987498,#1404,Gelhorn 2023,,,1
Exploring women's strong preference for women surgeons in breast healthcare.,Kahalon R; Adar R,"BACKGROUND: This study challenges the prevalent belief that surgical roles demand masculine traits, potentially limiting women's suitability for such positions. Contrary to this stereotype, we explored the hypothesis that in sensitive surgical procedures, where communal traits are valued, women patients might favor women surgeons. Two experimental studies investigated women's preferences for a man versus a woman surgeon in a breast exam and breast surgery. METHODS: In two studies we experimentally tested women's preferences for a man versus a woman surgeon for a breast exam (a noninvasive and non-complicated procedure), and breast surgery (an invasive and more complicated procedure). Study 2 delved into factors influencing these preferences, including patients' age, stereotypical perceptions of women surgeons as communal/warm, past negative experiences with men and women doctors, and previous body-related trauma. RESULTS: Women consistently preferred a woman surgeon for both procedures and expressed increased willingness to wait for an appointment with a woman surgeon. However, this preference was less pronounced for surgery than for an exam. Study 2 identified the stereotypical perception of women surgeons as communal/warm as the strongest predictor for this preference, along with previous negative experiences with men doctors and age. CONCLUSIONS: While some gender bias persists, this study underscores a notable preference for women surgeons in intimate medical services like breast exams or surgery. This preference holds practical implications for healthcare providers encouraging women's preventive checkups and offers insights for women medical students making residency choices.",2024,Apr,World J Surg,48,4,887-893,,10.1002/wjs.12098,38400765,#184,Kahalon 2024,,,0
Shared Decision-Making in Allergen Immunotherapy (AIT) Options Using a Questionnaire for Respiratory Allergic Patients: A Delphi Consensus Study.,Antón M; Cabañes N; Fernández-Meléndez S; Fernández-Nieto M; Jiménez-Ferrera G; Letrán A; Méndez-Brea P; Montoro J; Moreno F; Mur-Gimeno P; Rodríguez-Vázquez V; Rosado A; Sánchez-Guerrero I; Vega-Chicote JM; Vidal C,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to develop and validate a questionnaire, through a Delphi consensus, to be used by allergists in their routine clinical practice to assess the preferences of patients starting allergen immunotherapy (AIT) treatment using an objective approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Delphi consensus-driven process was used. The scientific committee, composed of 15 allergists, led the study and participated in the preparation of the questionnaire. Two-hundred panelists from different Spanish regions were invited to complete a 16-item questionnaire on a nine-point Likert scale covering six topic blocks. Consensus was achieved if ≥66.6% of panelists reached agreement or disagreement. RESULTS: Of the 200 experts invited to participate in the Delphi process, a total of 195 (97.5%) answered the questionnaire. The panel experts reached a consensus on ""agreement"" on a total of 12 of the 16 (75.0%) items, covering a total of six categories: (a) patient knowledge (2 questions), (b) barriers to patient adherence (3 questions), (c) patient behavior (4 questions), (d) future actions (3 questions), (e) treatment costs (2 questions), and (f) final patient preferences (2 questions). CONCLUSION: This Delphi consensus study validated a set of twelve recommended questions for patients objectively assessing their preferences and suitability for the most common AIT options available. The questionnaire intends to assist allergists in making an objective, unconditioned decision regarding the best AIT option for each patient, after informing them about the different routes.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,1771-1782,,10.2147/PPA.S409466,37520065,#1046,Antón 2023,,,0
The Patient preference predictor and the objection from higher-order preferences.,Mainz JT,"Recently, Jardas et al have convincingly defended the patient preference predictor (PPP) against a range of autonomy-based objections. In this response, I propose a new autonomy-based objection to the PPP that is not explicitly discussed by Jardas et al I call it the 'objection from higher-order preferences'. Even if this objection is not sufficient reason to reject the PPP, the objection constitutes a pro tanto reason that is at least as powerful as the ones discussed by Jardas et al.",2023,Mar,J Med Ethics,49,3,221-222,,10.1136/jme-2022-108427,35777961,#1494,Mainz 2023,,,0
"Utilisation of rural primary health centers for outpatient services - a study based on Rajasthan, India.",Srivastava AK; Gupt RK; Bhargava R; Singh RR; Songara D,"INTRODUCTION: Outpatient services are crucial for strengthening primary healthcare and reducing out-of-pocket spending, which has been one of the major causes of impoverishment. So it is also critical to comprehend the people's preferences in accessing primary healthcare facilities, as government primary healthcare facilities in India are underutilized. The current paper explores the factors that construct the individual's decision to seek outpatient care in primary healthcare facilities in India's largest state Rajasthan. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional survey conducted in 72 primary sample units of 24 primary health centers in 11 districts of Rajasthan, India, from November 2019 to January 2020. The study selected 368 households through purposive sampling. Out of 368 households, 460 people reported any illness and 326 reported outpatient visit to any health facility in the last 30 days from the date of the survey. ANALYSIS: The focus was on analyzing the data in the context of public and private health facilities to understand the factors influencing people's choice to access outpatient services. The principal component analysis is used to understand the relationship between facility preparedness and OPD uptake. Also, multivariate logistic regression is applied to assess the significant predictors in using primary health facility services. RESULT: Except for the 29% of patients who received no care, the proportion of patients attended public health facilities was 35%, and the rest were utilizing private health facilities. Those who sought care at PHCs were mostly over 45 years age, non-literate, and from the lowest wealth quintile. Logistic regression suggests that people belong to upper wealth quintile (OR = 0.298; 95% 0.118-0.753) are less likely to visit PHCs for treatment. Also, increase in distance of PHC (OR = 0.203; 95% CI 0.076-0.539) reduces the likelihood of their visit outpatient care. People are 9.7 times (OR = 9.740; 95% CI 2.856-33.217) more likely to visit a PHCs that are better equipped in terms of human resources, equipment, and medicine. CONCLUSION: The uptake of PHCs depends on several factors, which should be considered to ensure that all segments of society have equitable access to them. Through improved accessibility and quality of service, PHCs can be made more appealing to the larger population.",2023,Apr,BMC Health Serv Res,23,1,387,,10.1186/s12913-022-08934-y,37087489,#1318,Srivastava 2023,,,0
Defining Need Amid Exponential Change: Conceptual Challenges in Workforce Planning for Clinical Genetic Services.,Borle K; Kopac N; Dragojlovic N; Llorian ER; Lynd LD,"Rapid growth in the volume of referrals to clinical genetics services in many countries during the past 15 years makes workforce planning a critical policy tool in ensuring that the capacity of the clinical genetics workforce is large enough to meet current and future needs. This article explores the distinctive challenges of workforce planning in clinical genetics and provides recommendations for addressing these challenges using a needs-based planning approach. Specifically, at least 3 features complicate efforts to estimate the need for clinical genetic services: the difficulty in linking many clinical genetic services to concrete health outcomes; the rapidly changing nature of genetic medicine, which creates intrinsic uncertainty about the appropriate level of service; and the heightened relevance of patient preferences in this context. Our recommendations call for needs-based planning studies to include an explicit definition of necessary care, to be flexible in considering nonhealth benefits, to err on the side of including services currently funded by health systems even when evidence about outcomes is limited, and to use scenario analysis and expert input to explore the impact of uncertainty about patients' preferences and future technologies on estimates of workforce requirements.",2023,Aug,Clin Ther,45,8,695-701,,10.1016/j.clinthera.2023.07.005,37516568,#1001,Borle 2023,,,0
Advance Care Planning in Serious Illness: A Narrative Review.,Rosa WE; Izumi S; Sullivan DR; Lakin J; Rosenberg AR; Creutzfeldt CJ; Lafond D; Tjia J; Cotter V; Wallace C; Sloan DE; Cruz-Oliver DM; DeSanto-Madeya S; Bernacki R; Leblanc TW; Epstein AS,"CONTEXT: Advance care planning (ACP) intends to support person-centered medical decision-making by eliciting patient preferences. Research has not identified significant associations between ACP and goal-concordant end-of-life care, leading to justified scientific debate regarding ACP utility. OBJECTIVE: To delineate ACP's potential benefits and missed opportunities and identify an evidence-informed, clinically relevant path ahead for ACP in serious illness. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review merging the best available ACP empirical data, grey literature, and emergent scholarly discourse using a snowball search of PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar (2000-2022). Findings were informed by our team's interprofessional clinical and research expertise in serious illness care. RESULTS: Early ACP practices were largely tied to mandated document completion, potentially failing to capture the holistic preferences of patients and surrogates. ACP models focused on serious illness communication rather than documentation show promising patient and clinician results. Ideally, ACP would lead to goal-concordant care even amid the unpredictability of serious illness trajectories. But ACP might also provide a false sense of security that patients' wishes will be honored and revisited at end-of-life. An iterative, 'building block' framework to integrate ACP throughout serious illness is provided alongside clinical practice, research, and policy recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: We advocate a balanced approach to ACP, recognizing empirical deficits while acknowledging potential benefits and ethical imperatives (e.g., fostering clinician-patient trust and shared decision-making). We support prioritizing patient/surrogate-centered outcomes with more robust measures to account for interpersonal clinician-patient variables that likely inform ACP efficacy and may better evaluate information gleaned during serious illness encounters.",2023,Jan,J Pain Symptom Manage,65,1,e63-e78,,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2022.08.012,36028176,#1665,Rosa 2023,,,0
Developing hospital resilience domains in facing disruption era in Indonesia: a qualitative study.,Sari N; Omar M; Pasinringi SA; Zulkifli A; Sidin AI,"BACKGROUND: The studies of hospital resilience have been of increasing importance during the last decade due to disasters and pandemics. However, studies in developing the domain and indicators of hospital resilience were limited mainly on disaster response. A few studies of hospital resilience focused on how to deal with disruptions such as environmental turbulence, rapid technological changes, and changes in patient preferences. This study aims to develop domains and indicators of hospital resilience in facing the disruption era. METHODS: This qualitative study focused on exploring the domains and indicators to face disruptions that have been identified in the first exploratory phase of the studies. Key informants included hospital experts from the government, medical practitioners, and academics. A total of 20 key informants were involved in semi-structured interviews which were conducted face-to-face, via telephone and Zoom. Data was analyzed using a grounded theory approach to discover domains for a resilient hospital. RESULTS: The study identified a number of domains that are fundamental for a hospital to become a resilient in the face of disruption. These include readiness to face digital transformation, effective leadership, and flexibility in managing resources among others. Situation awareness and resilience ethos, implementation of marketing management, networking, and disaster anticipation are found to be equally important. These domains focused on the hospital's ability to deal with specific shocks from different perspectives as the result of changes from disruptions which are inevitable within the organizational business environment. CONCLUSIONS: The domains identified in the study are able to respond to the limitations of the concept of hospital resilience, which is currently more focused on hospital disaster resilience. They can be used to measure hospital resilience in the context of the volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA), which are relevant to the context of the Indonesia hospital industry.",2023,Dec,BMC Health Serv Res,23,1,1395,,10.1186/s12913-023-10416-8,38087264,#568,Sari 2023,,,0
Patient and General Population Preferences Regarding the Benefits and Harms of Treatment for Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,Menges D; Piatti MC; Omlin A; Cathomas R; Benamran D; Fischer S; Iselin C; Küng M; Lorch A; Prause L; Rothermundt C; O'Meara Stern A; Zihler D; Lippuner M; Braun J; Cerny T; Puhan MA,"BACKGROUND: Patient preferences for treatment outcomes are important to guide decision-making in clinical practice, but little is known about the preferences of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient preferences regarding the attributed benefits and harms of systemic treatments for mHSPC and preference heterogeneity between individuals and specific subgroups. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted an online discrete choice experiment (DCE) preference survey among 77 patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) and 311 men from the general population in Switzerland between November 2021 and August 2022. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We evaluated preferences and preference heterogeneity related to survival benefits and treatment-related adverse effects using mixed multinomial logit models and estimated the maximum survival time participants were willing to trade to avert specific adverse effects. We further assessed characteristics associated with different preference patterns via subgroup and latent class analyses. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Patients with mPC showed an overall stronger preference for survival benefits in comparison to men from the general population (p = 0.004), with substantial preference heterogeneity between individuals within the two samples (both p < 0.001). There was no evidence of differences in preferences for men aged 45-65 yr versus ≥65 yr, patients with mPC in different disease stages or with different adverse effect experiences, or general population participants with and without experiences with cancer. Latent class analyses suggested the presence of two groups strongly preferring either survival or the absence of adverse effects, with no specific characteristic clearly associated with belonging to either group. Potential biases due to participant selection, cognitive burden, and hypothetical choice scenarios may limit the study results. CONCLUSIONS: Given the relevant heterogeneity in participant preferences regarding the benefits and harms of treatment for mHSPC, patient preferences should be explicitly discussed during decision-making in clinical practice and reflected in clinical practice guidelines and regulatory assessment regarding treatment for mHSPC. PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined the preferences (values and perceptions) of patients and men from the general population regarding the benefits and harms of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. There were large differences between men in how they balanced the expected survival benefits and potential adverse effects. While some men strongly valued survival, others more strongly valued the absence of adverse effects. Therefore, it is important to discuss patient preferences in clinical practice.",2023,May,Eur Urol Open Sci,51,,26-38,,10.1016/j.euros.2023.03.001,37187724,#1260,Menges 2023,,,1
Efficiency and Impact of Hypnoanalgesia for Cardiac Catheterisation in Paediatric Population.,Fontanges PA; Haudiquet J; De Jonkheere J; Delarue A; Domanski O; Rakza T; Hascoet S; Bichali S; Baudelet JB; Godart F; Houeijeh A,"Hypnoanalgesia is a promising non-pharmacologic adjunct technique in paediatric interventions. Its safety, efficiency, and impacts on paediatric cardiac catheterisation (CC) are unknown. METHODS: In a prospective study, patients aged <16 years who underwent CC under hypnoanalgesia from January to December 2021 were included. Pain and anxiety were assessed using the analgesia nociception index (ANI) and the visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included; the mean age was 10.5 years, and the mean weight was 37 kg. Catheterisations were interventional in 10 patients (62.5%). Hypnoanalgesia indications were general anaesthesia (GA) contraindication in four patients (25.0%), the need for accurate pressure measurements in three patients (18.7%), and interventionist/patient preferences in nine (56.3%). CC was accomplished in 15 patients (93.7%), even in complicated cases. In one case, pulmonary artery pressures were normalised compared to previous catheterisation under local anaesthesia alone. The VAS score was under 5/10 for all patients. The ANI remained above 50 (no painful zone) for all but one patient. There was no significant decrease in the ANI during the intervention compared to the baseline (p = 0.62). No complications were reported. CONCLUSION: Paediatric CC is feasible and safe under hypnoanalgesia, even in complicated cases. Hypnoanalgesia was efficient in managing pain and stress, and it ensures more reliable pressure measurements.",2023,Oct,J Clin Med,12,19,,,10.3390/jcm12196410,37835054,#784,Fontanges 2023,,,0
Patients preferences for communication during video consultations.,Mazouri-Karker S; Braillard O; Lüchinger R; Bajwa N; Achab S; Hudelson P; Dao MD; Junod-Perron N,"Objective The aim of our simulation-based study was to explore patient preferences for physician behaviours in video consultations METHODS: We conducted an exploratory study in outpatient setting in Geneva, Switzerland.Patients were invited to watch two variations videos of six simulated physician communication behaviours (camera framing, gaze orientation, initial talk at the opening phase, privacy reminder, pauses, empathy)and to indicate which one they preferred RESULTS: 417 patients watched three different video-recorded encounters. Most patients preferred framing with both face and bust (50.7 %) versus face alone (21.8 %). They valued eye gazing towards the camera (42.9 %) versus eye gazing shifting between screen and camera (13 %). The social talk related to the connection quality was appreciated (43.1 % vs 17.1 %) as well as the privacy reminder (80.8 % vs 6.5 %). Patients preferred short rather than long pauses after physician's statements (63.9 vs 14.9 %) as well as expressive rather than neutral nonverbal behaviour (46.7 % vs 17.6 %). CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that patients prefer the use of video specific communication behaviours recommended by experts except for shifting eye gaze and long pauses after physician's statements.

Heterogeneity in management of category II fetal tracings: data from a multihospital healthcare system.,Thayer SM; Faramarzi P; Krauss MJ; Snider E; Kelly JC; Carter EB; Frolova AI; Odibo AO; Raghuraman N,"BACKGROUND: Electronic fetal monitoring is widely used to identify and intervene in suspected fetal hypoxia and/or acidemia. Category II fetal heart rate tracings are the most common class of fetal monitoring in labor, and intrauterine resuscitation is recommended given the association of category II fetal heart rate tracings with fetal acidemia. However, limited published data are available to guide intrauterine resuscitation technique selection, leading to heterogeneity in the response to category II fetal heart rate tracings. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize approaches to intrauterine resuscitation in response to category II fetal heart rate tracings. STUDY DESIGN: This was a survey study administered to labor unit nurses and delivering clinicians (physicians and midwives) across 7 hospitals in a Midwestern healthcare system spanning 2 states. The survey posed 3 category II fetal heart rate tracing scenarios (recurrent late decelerations, minimal variability, and recurrent variable decelerations) and asked participants to select first- and second-line intrauterine resuscitation management strategies. The participants were asked to quantify the level of influence certain factors have on their choice using a scale from 1 to 5. Intrauterine resuscitation strategy selection was compared by clinical role and hospital type (nurses vs delivering clinicians and university-affiliated hospital vs non-university-affiliated hospital). RESULTS: Of 610 providers invited to take the survey, 163 participated (response rate of 27%): 37% of participants from university-affiliated hospitals, 62% of nurses, and 37% of physicians. Maternal repositioning was the most selected first-line strategy, regardless of the type of category II fetal heart rate tracing. First-line management varied by clinical role and hospital affiliation for each fetal heart rate tracing scenario, particularly for minimal variability, which was associated with the most heterogeneity in the first-line approach. Previous experience and recommendations from professional societies were the most influential factors in intrauterine resuscitation selection overall. Of note, 16.5% of participants reported that published evidence did not influence their choice at all. Participants from a university-affiliated hospital were more likely than participants from a non-university-affiliated hospital to consider patient preference when selecting an intrauterine resuscitation technique. Nurses and delivering clinicians differed significantly in the rationale for management choices: nurses were more often influenced by advice from other healthcare providers on the team (P<.001), whereas delivering clinicians were more influenced by literature (P=.02) and ease of technique (P=.02). CONCLUSION: There was significant heterogeneity in the management of category II fetal heart rate tracing. In addition, motivations for choice in intrauterine resuscitation technique varied by hospital type and clinical role. These factors should be considered when creating fetal monitoring and intrauterine resuscitation protocols.",2023,Jul,Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,5,7,101001,,10.1016/j.ajogmf.2023.101001,37146688,#1115,Thayer 2023,,,0
Allergic Rhinitis: A Review.,Bernstein JA; Bernstein JS; Makol R; Ward S,"IMPORTANCE: Allergic rhinitis affects an estimated 15% of the US population (approximately 50 million individuals) and is associated with the presence of asthma, eczema, chronic or recurrent sinusitis, cough, and both tension and migraine headaches. OBSERVATIONS: Allergic rhinitis occurs when disruption of the epithelial barrier allows allergens to penetrate the mucosal epithelium of nasal passages, inducing a T-helper type 2 inflammatory response and production of allergen-specific IgE. Allergic rhinitis typically presents with symptoms of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, postnasal drainage, sneezing, and itching of the eyes, nose, and throat. In an international study, the most common symptoms of allergic rhinitis were rhinorrhea (90.38%) and nasal congestion (94.23%). Patients with nonallergic rhinitis present primarily with nasal congestion and postnasal drainage frequently associated with sinus pressure, ear plugging, muffled sounds and pain, and eustachian tube dysfunction that is less responsive to nasal corticosteroids. Patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis typically have physical examination findings of edematous and pale turbinates. Patients with perennial allergic rhinitis typically have erythematous and inflamed turbinates with serous secretions that appear similar to other forms of chronic rhinitis at physical examination. Patients with nonallergic rhinitis have negative test results for specific IgE aeroallergens. Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as symptoms occurring less than 4 consecutive days/week or less than 4 consecutive weeks/year. Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as symptoms occurring more often than 4 consecutive days/week and for more than 4 consecutive weeks/year. Patients with allergic rhinitis should avoid inciting allergens. In addition, first-line treatment for mild intermittent or mild persistent allergic rhinitis may include a second-generation H1 antihistamine (eg, cetirizine, fexofenadine, desloratadine, loratadine) or an intranasal antihistamine (eg, azelastine, olopatadine), whereas patients with persistent moderate to severe allergic rhinitis should be treated initially with an intranasal corticosteroid (eg, fluticasone, triamcinolone, budesonide, mometasone) either alone or in combination with an intranasal antihistamine. In contrast, first-line therapy for patients with nonallergic rhinitis consists of an intranasal antihistamine as monotherapy or in combination with an intranasal corticosteroid. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Allergic rhinitis is associated with symptoms of nasal congestion, sneezing, and itching of the eyes, nose, and throat. Patients with allergic rhinitis should be instructed to avoid inciting allergens. Therapies include second-generation H1 antihistamines (eg, cetirizine, fexofenadine, desloratadine, loratadine), intranasal antihistamines (eg, azelastine, olopatadine), and intranasal corticosteroids (eg, fluticasone, triamcinolone, budesonide, mometasone) and should be selected based on the severity and frequency of symptoms and patient preference.",2024,Mar,JAMA,331,10,866-877,,10.1001/jama.2024.0530,38470381,#247,Bernstein 2024,,,0
"Proportion of medical admissions that may be hospitalised at home and their service utilisation patterns: a single-centre, descriptive retrospective cohort study in Singapore.",Ko SQ; Wang Z; Goh SLE; Soong JTY,"OBJECTIVES: For eligible patient groups, hospital-at-home (HaH) programmes have been shown to deliver equivalent patient outcomes with cost reduction compared with standard care. This study aims to establish a benchmark of inpatient admissions that could potentially be substituted by HaH services. DESIGN: Descriptive retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Academic tertiary hospital in Singapore. PARTICIPANTS: 124 253 medical admissions over 20 months (January 2016 to August 2017). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure was the proportion of hospitalised patients who may be eligible for HaH, based on eligibility criteria adapted for the Singapore context. The secondary measures were the utilisation patterns and outcomes of these patients. RESULTS: Applying generalised eligibility criteria to the retrospective dataset showed that 53.0% of 124 253 medical admissions fitted the eligibility criteria for HaH based on administrative data. 46.8% of such patients had a length of stay <48 hours ('short-stay') and 53.1% had a length of stay ≥48 hours ('medium-stay'). The mortality rate and the 30-day readmission rate were lower in the 'short-stay' cohort (0.6%, 12.8%) compared with the 'medium-stay' cohort (0.7%, 20.3%). The key services used by both groups were: parenteral drug administration, blood investigations, imaging procedures and consultations with allied health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 53.0% of medical admissions receive care elements that HaH programmes could provide. Applying estimates of functional limitations and patient preferences, we propose a target of ~18% of inpatient medical admissions to be substituted by HaH services. The methodology adopted in this paper is a reproducible approach to characterise potential patients and service utilisation requirements when developing such programmes.",2023,Oct,BMJ Open,13,10,e073692,,10.1136/bmjopen-2023-073692,37879677,#765,Ko 2023,,,0
Informed Decision Making for Anticoagulation Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation.,Martinez KA; Linfield DT; Shaker V; Rothberg MB,"BACKGROUND: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must decide between warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), a decision involving important tradeoffs. Our objective was to understand whether physicians engage patients in informed decision making for anticoagulants. DESIGN: We performed an analysis of recorded conversations between physicians and anticoagulation-naïve patients in the Verilogue Point-of-Practice database. We assessed the presence of 7 elements of informed decision making, as well as a discussion of financial costs. RESULTS: Of 37 encounters with 21 physicians, 92% resulted in a DOAC prescription and 8% resulted in a warfarin prescription. Seventy percent met criteria for discussion of pros and cons, 70% for discussion of the alternatives, 43% presented the decision, 30% included an assessment of patient understanding, 22% included an explanation of the patient's role in decision making, 22% included an assessment of patient preferences, and 19% included a discussion of uncertainty. Two encounters (5%) included all 7 elements and 9 (24%) included none. Physicians discussed treatment costs with patients in 43% of encounters. LIMITATIONS: We assessed informed decision making in a single encounter. Physicians and patients may have had other discussions that were not captured in our data. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians often presented the alternatives but did not generally engage patients in informed decision making. The high rate of DOAC prescriptions is likely the result of physician preferences, as patient preferences were rarely assessed. IMPLICATIONS: Strategies to support physicians in engaging patients in informed decision making for anticoagulation are needed. HIGHLIGHTS: While physicians discussed the alternatives and presented pros and cons with patients, they rarely assessed patient preferences, explained the patient's role in decision making, or addressed uncertainty.The cost of treatment with DOACs versus warfarin was discussed by physicians in less than half of encounters, limiting patients' ability to make informed decisions for anticoagulation.Only 2 encounters (5%) fulfilled all 7 elements of informed decision making.",2023,Feb,Med Decis Making,43,2,263-269,,10.1177/0272989X221121350,36059267,#1567,Martinez 2023,,,0
Active surveillance should be considered for select men with Grade Group 2 prostate cancer.,Pekala KR; Bergengren O; Eastham JA; Carlsson SV,"BACKGROUND: Treatment decisions for localized prostate cancer must balance patient preferences, oncologic risk, and preservation of sexual, urinary and bowel function. While Active Surveillance (AS) is the recommended option for men with Grade Group 1 (Gleason Score 3 + 3 = 6) prostate cancer without other intermediate-risk features, men with Grade Group 2 (Gleason Score 3 + 4 = 7) are typically recommended active treatment. For select patients, AS can be a possible initial management strategy for men with Grade Group 2. Herein, we review current urology guidelines and the urologic literature regarding recommendations and evidence for AS for this patient group. MAIN BODY: AS benefits men with prostate cancer by maintaining their current quality of life and avoiding treatment side effects. AS protocols with close follow up always allow for an option to change course and pursue curative treatment. All the major guideline organizations now include Grade Group 2 disease with slightly differing definitions of eligibility based on risk using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, clinical stage, and other factors. Selected men with Grade Group 2 on AS have similar rates of deferred treatment and metastasis to men with Grade Group 1 on AS. There is a growing body of evidence from randomized controlled trials, large observational (prospective and retrospective) cohorts that confirm the oncologic safety of AS for these men. While some men will inevitably conclude AS at some point due to clinical reclassification with biopsy or imaging, some men may be able to stay on AS until transition to watchful waiting (WW). Magnetic resonance imaging is an important tool to confirm AS eligibility, to monitor progression and guide prostate biopsy. CONCLUSION: AS is a viable initial management option for well-informed and select men with Grade Group 2 prostate cancer, low volume of pattern 4, and no other adverse clinicopathologic findings following a well-defined monitoring protocol. In the modern era of AS, urologists have tools at their disposal to better stage patients at initial diagnosis, risk stratify patients, and gain information on the biologic potential of a patient's prostate cancer.",2023,Sep,BMC Urol,23,1,152,,10.1186/s12894-023-01314-6,37777716,#855,Pekala 2023,,,0
Patients' Preference for Participation in Medical Decision-Making: Secondary Analysis of the BEDSIDE-OUTSIDE Trial.,Becker C; Gross S; Gamp M; Beck K; Amacher SA; Mueller J; Bohren C; Blatter R; Schaefert R; Schuetz P; Leuppi J; Bassetti S; Hunziker S,"BACKGROUND: Patients may prefer different levels of involvement in decision-making regarding their medical care which may influence their medical knowledge. OBJECTIVE: We investigated associations of patients' decisional control preference (DCP) with their medical knowledge, ward round performance measures (e.g., duration, occurrence of sensitive topics), and perceived quality of care measures (e.g., trust in the healthcare team, satisfaction with hospital stay). DESIGN: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled multicenter trial conducted between 2017 and 2019 at 3 Swiss teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients that were hospitalized for inpatient care. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was patients' subjective average knowledge of their medical care (rated on a visual analog scale from 0 to 100). We classified patients as active, collaborative, and passive according to the Control Preference Scale. Data collection was performed before, during, and after the ward round. KEY RESULTS: Among the 761 included patients, those with a passive DCP had a similar subjective average (mean ± SD) knowledge (81.3 ± 19.4 points) compared to patients with a collaborative DCP (78.7 ± 20.3 points) and active DCP (81.3 ± 21.5 points), p = 0.25. Regarding patients' trust in physicians and nurses, we found that patients with an active vs. passive DCP reported significantly less trust in physicians (adjusted difference, - 5.08 [95% CI, - 8.69 to - 1.48 points], p = 0.006) and in nurses (adjusted difference, - 3.41 [95% CI, - 6.51 to - 0.31 points], p = 0.031). Also, patients with an active vs. passive DCP were significantly less satisfied with their hospital stay (adjusted difference, - 7.17 [95% CI, - 11.01 to - 3.34 points], p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with active DCP have lower trust in the healthcare team and lower overall satisfaction despite similar perceived medical knowledge.

Immunotherapy in oncology and the kidneys: a clinical review of the evaluation and management of kidney immune-related adverse events.,Rao Ullur A; Côté G; Pelletier K; Kitchlu A,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are now widely used in the treatment of many cancers, and currently represent the standard of care for multiple malignancies. These agents enhance the T cell immune response to target cancer tissues, and have demonstrated considerable benefits for cancer outcomes. However, despite these improved outcomes, there are important kidney immune-related adverse events (iRAEs) associated with ICI. Acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis remains the most frequent kidney iRAE, however glomerular lesions and electrolytes disturbances are increasingly being recognized and reported. In this review, we summarize clinical features and identify risk factors for kidney iRAEs, and discuss the current understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms. We highlight the evidence basis for guideline-recommended management of ICI-related kidney injury as well as gaps in current knowledge. We advocate for judicious use of kidney biopsy to identify ICI-associated kidney injury, and early use of corticosteroid treatment where appropriate. Selected patients may also be candidates for re-challenge with ICI therapy after a kidney iRAE, in view of current data on recurrent rates of kidney injury. Risk of benefits of re-challenge must be considered on an individual considering patient preferences and prognosis. Lastly, we review current knowledge of ICI use in the setting of patients with end-stage kidney disease, including kidney transplant recipients and those receiving dialysis, which suggest that these patients should not be summarily excluded from the potential benefits of these cancer therapies.",2023,Jun,Clin Kidney J,16,6,939-951,,10.1093/ckj/sfad014,37261008,#1184,RaoUllur 2023,,,0
"Understanding rural-urban differences in veterans' internet access, use and patient preferences for telemedicine.",O'Shea AMJ; Gibson M; Merchant J; Rewerts K; Miell K; Kaboli PJ; Shimada SL,"BACKGROUND: The expansion of telemedicine (e.g., telephone or video) in the Veterans Health Administration (VA) raises concerns for health care disparities between rural and urban veterans. Factors impeding telemedicine use (e.g., broadband, digital literacy, age) disproportionally affect rural veterans. PURPOSE: To examine veteran-reported broadband access, internet use, familiarity with, and preferences for telemedicine stratified by residential rurality. METHODS: Three hundred fifty veterans with a VA primary care visit in March 2022 completed a 30-min computer-assisted telephone interview. The sampling design stratified veterans by residential rurality (i.e., rural or urban) and how primary care was delivered (i.e., in-person or by video). Counts and weighted percentages are reported. FINDINGS: After accounting for survey weights, 96.2% of respondents had in-home internet access and 89.5% reported functional connection speeds. However, rural- compared to urban-residing veterans were less likely to experience a telemedicine visit in the past year (74.1% vs. 85.2%; p = 0.02). When comparing telemedicine to in-person visits, rural versus urban-residing veterans rated them not as good (45.3% vs. 36.8%), just as good (51.1% vs. 53.1%), or better (3.5% vs. 10.0%) (p = 0.05). To make telemedicine visits easier, veterans, regardless of where they lived, recommended technology training (46.4%), help accessing the internet (26.1%), or provision of an internet-enabled device (25.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Though rural-residing veterans were less likely to experience a telemedicine visit, the same actionable facilitators to improve telemedicine access were reported regardless of residential rurality. Importantly, technology training was most often recommended. Policy makers, patient advocates, and other stakeholders should consider novel initiatives to provide training resources.",2023,Nov,J Rural Health,,,,,10.1111/jrh.12805,37935649,#692,O'SheaAMJ 2023,,,0
The importance of reminders and patient preferences to improve inhaler technique in older adults with COPD.,Barnestein-Fonseca P; Cotta-Luque VM; Aguiar-Leiva VP; Leiva-Fernández J; Martos-Crespo F; Leiva-Fernández F,"Objectives: Medication non-adherence in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is common. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of two interventions to improve the inhalation technique (IT) in patients with pulmonary disease is common. Also determine optimal IT reminder time and to test the role of preferences in the intervention selection. Method: 726 pulmonary disease in common patients (consecutive sampling) from two trials: 1) TECEPOC-study (patients' preference trial/comprehensive cohort design) 2) TIEPOC-study (randomised controlled trial). Interventions: intervention-A (ad-hoc leaflet with instructions about correct IT according Spanish Respiratory Society), intervention B (intervention A+ individual training by instructors). Four visits were performed (baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months). Data on IT, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, quality of life and respiratory drugs were recorded. Analysis under intention to treat principle. Multivariate analysis was conducted to measure the potential modifying factors of improvement in the IT along follow-up. Results: 660 patients (90.9%) did not perform a correct IT at baseline 89.75% with Handihaler, 86.95% with Turbuhaler, 84.75% with Accuhaler and 87.35% with pMDI. At 12 months, 221 patients 29.9% performed correctly the IT; a decrease in the slope of the curve (correct IT) was detected at 3 months follow-up. Intervention B was the most effective in both trials compared to control group or intervention A, regardless of preferences: 1) TECEPOC Study (preference trial): Intervention B versus control group, NNT = 3.22 (IC95%, 2.27-5.52); and versus Intervention A, NNT = 3.57 (CI95%, 2.41-6.8). Preferences improved 6.7% in the correct IT without statistical significance. 2) TIEPOC Study (randomized controlled trial): Intervention B versus control group, NNT = 1.74 (IC95%, 1.47-2.17), and versus intervention A, NNT = 3.33 (CI 95%, 2.43-5.55). No differences were measured between Intervention A and control group. Conclusion: Individual training significantly improves IT. Reminders every 3 months are recommended. Preferences do not influence the intervention effectiveness.",2022,,Front Pharmacol,13,,989362,,10.3389/fphar.2022.989362,36686678,#1602,Barnestein-Fonseca 2022,,,0
The Evolving Treatment Landscape of Merkel Cell Carcinoma.,Singh N; McClure EM; Akaike T; Park SY; Huynh ET; Goff PH; Nghiem P,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) has a high risk of recurrence and requires unique treatment relative to other skin cancers. The patient population is generally older, with comorbidities. Multidisciplinary and personalized care is therefore paramount, based on patient preferences regarding risks and benefits. Positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) is the most sensitive staging modality and reveals clinically occult disease in ~ 16% of patients. Discovery of occult disease spread markedly alters management. Newly diagnosed, localized disease is often managed with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), local excision, primary wound closure, and post-operative radiation therapy (PORT). In contrast, metastatic disease is usually treated systemically with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). However, one or more of these approaches may not be indicated. Criteria for such exceptions and alternative approaches will be discussed. Because MCC recurs in 40% of patients and early detection/treatment of advanced disease is advantageous, close surveillance is recommended. Given that over 90% of initial recurrences arise within 3 years, surveillance frequency can be rapidly decreased after this high-risk period. Patient-specific assessment of risk is important because recurrence risk varies widely (15 to > 80%: Merkelcell.org/recur) depending on baseline patient characteristics and time since treatment. Blood-based surveillance tests are now available (Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) antibodies and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)) with excellent sensitivity that can spare patients from contrast dye, radioactivity, and travel to a cancer imaging facility. If recurrent disease is locoregional, management with surgery and/or RT is typically indicated. ICIs are now the first line for systemic/advanced MCC, with objective response rates (ORRs) exceeding 50%. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is sometimes used for debulking disease or in patients who cannot tolerate ICI. ICI-refractory disease is the major problem faced by this field. Fortunately, numerous promising therapies are on the horizon to address this clinical need.",2023,Sep,Curr Treat Options Oncol,24,9,1231-1258,,10.1007/s11864-023-01118-8,37403007,#923,Singh 2023,,,0
Contextual community epinephrine prescribing: Is more always better?,Shaker M; Abrams EM; Sublett JW,"OBJECTIVE: Prompt administration of epinephrine is first-line management of anaphylaxis. Although severe anaphylaxis may require more than 1 epinephrine dose, multiple epinephrine device packs may not be necessary for all patients at risk for allergic reactions. DATA SOURCES: A narrative review was used to describe key considerations to contextualize community epinephrine prescribing. RESULTS: Anaphylaxis has a lifetime prevalence of 1.6% to 5.1%. Meeting diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis is not required for epinephrine treatment of a severe allergic reaction. A ""1-2-3"" approach to anaphylaxis treatment is important to clearly relay central management steps: promptly administer a first dose of intramuscular epinephrine with proper positioning, and activate emergency medical services if immediate symptom resolution does not occur; consider a second dose of intramuscular epinephrine with consideration of oxygen administration and intravenous fluid if initial epinephrine response is not adequate; and consider a third intramuscular epinephrine dose together with consideration of intravenous fluid support and oxygen for continued lack of appropriate response. Although multiple epinephrine doses may be required to treat severe anaphylaxis, 90% of anaphylaxis cases do not require more than 1 epinephrine dose. A universal requirement for multiple epinephrine devices in patients without a history of anaphylaxis is not cost-effective. Patients without a history of anaphylaxis may be managed without multiple device prescriptions within a patient-preference sensitive paradigm of care. CONCLUSION: Anaphylaxis prevention involves appropriate education to avoid allergen triggers, recognize symptoms of an allergic reaction, rapidly access and administer intramuscular epinephrine, and appropriately activate emergency medical services when needed. For patients with previous anaphylaxis, particularly those who have required more than 1 dose of epinephrine to treat an allergic reaction, possessing multiple epinephrine devices is an important part of managing community anaphylaxis risk.",2023,Aug,Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol,131,2,176-184,,10.1016/j.anai.2023.05.012,37209832,#1017,Shaker 2023,,,0
Current Practices and Challenges When Submitting Patient Experience Data for Regulatory Decisions by the US Food and Drug Administration: An Industry Survey.,Pinto CA; Tervonen T; Jimenez-Moreno C; Levitan B; Soriano Gabarró M; Girman C; Norquist JM; Hauber B,"OBJECTIVES: To understand industry practices and challenges when submitting patient experience data (PED) for regulatory decisions by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). METHODS: A two-part online survey related to collection, submission, and use of PED by FDA in regulatory decision-making (part 1) and a best-worst exercise for prioritizing potential PED initiatives (part 2) was completed by industry and contract research organization (CRO) members with ≥ 2 years of recent experience with patient-reported outcome (PRO), natural history study (NHS), or patient preference (PP) data; and direct experience with FDA filings including PED. RESULTS: A total of 50 eligible respondents (84% industry) completed part 1 of the survey, among which 46 completed part 2. Respondents mostly had PRO (86%) and PP (50%) experience. All indicated that FDA meetings should have a standing agenda item to discuss PED. Most (78%) reported meetings should occur before pivotal trials. A common challenge was justifying inclusion without knowing if and how data will be used. Most agreed that FDA and industry should co-develop the PED table in the FDA clinical review (74%), and the table should report reason(s) for not using PED (96%) in regulatory decision-making. Most important efforts to advance PED use in decision-making were a dedicated meeting pathway and expanded FDA guidance (51% each). CONCLUSIONS: FDA has policy targets expanding PED use, but challenges remain regarding pathways for PED submission and transparency in regulatory decision-making. Alignment on the use of existing meeting opportunities to discuss PED, co-development of the PED table, and expanded guidance are encouraged.",2024,Mar,Patient,17,2,147-159,,10.1007/s40271-023-00653-8,38085458,#305,Pinto 2024,,,1
How do patients value features of biological medicine in rheumatoid arthritis? A discrete choice experiment.,Zartab S; Nikfar S; Jamshidi A; Toroski M; Varahrami V; Fatemi B; Kebriaeezadeh A,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to quantify the preference of the patients regarding biological DMARDs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients' preferences were assessed using a discrete choice experiment. Eighteen different surveys describing eight attributes were designed using experimental design methods. Each survey presented eight choice tasks with two options for patients to choose one. A conditional logit model was used to calculate relative importance and willingness to pay. Subgroup analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of the patients' characteristic on their preferences. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included in the study. All attributes had significant effects on the patients' choices. The most important feature was the ability to preserve physical function. The least important feature was the route of administration. Surprisingly, the out-of-pocket cost was one of the last priorities for respondents. According to the relative importance calculations, 80% of the patients' preferences can be obtained by clinical attributes. Based on subgroup analysis, the most important patient characteristic that affected their choices was the monthly out-of-pocket history. CONCLUSIONS: Different features of treatment had different effects on the patients' preferences. Quantification of the impact of each attribute not only revealed their relative importance but also determined the trade-off rate among them.",2023,Jul-Dec,Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res,23,6,701-708,,10.1080/14737167.2023.2210836,37218452,#1109,Zartab 2023,,,1
"Surveillance Imaging Strategies for Pituitary Adenomas: When, How Frequent, and When to Stop.",Yuen KCJ; Ghalib L; Buchfelder M; Hughes J; Langlois F; Molitch ME,"OBJECTIVE: To describe a practical approach of when and how often to perform imaging, and when to stop imaging pituitary adenomas (PAs). METHODS: A literature review was carried out and recommendations provided are derived largely from personal experience. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging is the mainstay imaging modality of choice in the assessment, treatment planning, and follow-up of PAs. These adenomas are discovered incidentally during imaging for a variety of unrelated conditions, because of clinical symptoms related to mass effects on the adjacent structures, or during workup for functional alterations of the adenoma. Imaging is also used in the preoperative and postoperative phases of assessment of PAs, for surgical and radiotherapy planning, for postoperative surveillance to assess for adenoma stability and detection of adenoma recurrence, and for surveillance to monitor for adenoma growth in unoperated PAs. Currently, because there are no evidence-based consensus recommendations, the optimal strategy for surveillance imaging of PAs is not clearly established. Younger age, initial adenoma size, extrasellar extension, mass effect, cavernous sinus invasion, functional status, histopathologic characteristics, cost considerations, imaging accessibility, patient preference, and patient contraindications (eg, implanted metallic devices and patient claustrophobia) are all important factors that influence the strategy for surveillance imaging. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a practical approach of performing surveillance imaging strategies for PAs that should be individualized based on clinical presentation, history, adenoma morphology on imaging, and histopathologic characteristics.",2024,Mar,Endocr Pract,30,3,282-291,,10.1016/j.eprac.2023.12.014,38160940,#295,YuenKCJ 2024,,,0

Mailing abortion pills does not delay care: A cohort study comparing mailed to in-person dispensing of abortion medications in the United States.,Koenig LR; Raymond EG; Gold M; Boraas CM; Kaneshiro B; Winikoff B; Coplon L; Upadhyay UD,"OBJECTIVE: Given the substantial barriers to abortion access in the United States, many clinics now mail patients abortion medications. We examined whether dispensing the medications by mail prolonged time to medication use. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed data from no-test medication abortions with medication provided either by mail or in a clinic from 11 United States clinics from February 2020 to January 2021. We examined mean number of days from patients' first contact with the clinic to mifepristone ingestion, its two-component intervals (first contact to medication dispensing and dispensing to mifepristone ingestion), and pregnancy duration at mifepristone ingestion. We used Poisson regression to compare mean outcomes across three dispensing methods: in-person, mailed from the clinic, and mailed from a mail-order pharmacy. RESULTS: Among the 2600 records, patients took mifepristone on average at 49 days of gestation (95% CI, 47-51) and 7 days (95% CI, 4-10) after first contact. Mean time from first contact to mifepristone ingestion was 6 days when medications were dispensed in-person and 9 days when mailed (p = 0.38). While time from first contact to dispensing was similar across methods (6 days in-person, 5 days mailed, p = 0.77), more time elapsed from dispensing to mifepristone ingestion when medications were mailed (4 days from clinic, 5 days from mail-order pharmacy) versus dispensed in-person (0.3 days, p < 0.001). Time to mifepristone ingestion was shorter with higher pregnancy duration. Pregnancy duration at ingestion was similar across methods (48 days in-person, 50 days mailed). CONCLUSIONS: Mailing medications did not significantly prolong time from patients' first contact with the clinic to mifepristone ingestion or increase pregnancy duration at mifepristone ingestion. IMPLICATIONS: Abortion providers should offer a range of medication abortion dispensing options, prioritizing patient preference.",2023,May,Contraception,121,,109962,,10.1016/j.contraception.2023.109962,36736715,#1288,Koenig 2023,,,0

Understanding what matters to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients when considering treatment options: A US patient preference survey.,George DJ; Mohamed AF; Tsai JH; Karimi M; Ning N; Jayade S; Botteman M,"BACKGROUND: Understanding how patients perceive the efficacy, safety, and administrative burden of treatments for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) can facilitate shared-decision making for optimal management. This study sought to elicit patient preferences for mCRPC treatments in the US. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using the discrete-choice experiment method. Participants were asked to state their choices over successive sets of treatment alternatives, defined by varying levels of treatment attributes: overall survival (OS), months until patients develop a fracture or bone metastasis, likelihood of requiring radiation to control bone pain, fatigue, nausea, and administration (i.e., oral/IV injection/IV infusion). Using mixed logit models, we determined the value (i.e., preference weights) that respondents placed on each attribute. Relative attribute importance (RAI) and marginal rates of substitution (MRS) were calculated to understand patients' willingness to make tradeoffs among different attributes. RESULTS: The final data set numbered 160 participants, with a mean age of 71.6 years old and a mean of 8.96 years since prostate cancer diagnosis. Participants' treatment preferences were as follows: OS (RAI: 31%), bone pain control (23%), nausea (16%), delaying fracture or bone metastasis (15%), fatigue (11%), and administration (3%). The MRS demonstrated that respondents were willing to trade 1.9 months of OS to eliminate moderate nausea and 3.3 months of OS for a reduction in fatigue from severe to mild. CONCLUSIONS: Improving OS is the highest priority for patients with mCRPC, but they are willing to trade some survival to reduce the risk of requiring radiation to control bone pain, delay a fracture or bone metastasis, and experience less severe nausea and fatigue.",2023,Mar,Cancer Med,12,5,6040-6055,,10.1002/cam4.5313,36226867,#1487,George 2023,,,1
Understanding Treatment Preferences Among People Living with HIV in Australia: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,Fifer S; Kularatne T; Tan M; Drummond F; Rule J,"PURPOSE: To better understand what is most important to people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) when choosing their treatment. We assessed how PLWH trade off the potential risks and benefits of oral and long acting injectable (LAI) treatments. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Firstly, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 PLWH to develop a holistic understanding of experiences and determine attributes that contribute to treatment decision-making. Secondly, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) was used to understand the treatment preferences for PLWH with n = 99 PLWH aged 18 years or over with a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and who were currently using anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Study participants were presented with 12 scenarios and asked to select their preferred treatment among two hypothetical injectable treatment alternatives, ""injection 1"" and ""injection 2"" and their current oral ART treatment. The DCE data were modelled using a latent class model (LCM). RESULTS: The model revealed significant heterogeneity in preferences for treatment attributes among study participants. Two segments/classes of PLWH were identified. The first segment expressed a strong preference for their current oral treatment; the second segment showed strong preference for the injection treatment and for it to be administered in a GP clinic. Overall, out-of-pocket cost was the most important attribute for participants. One-third of PLWH were willing to switch to an LAI. CONCLUSION: Not all PLWH valued the same treatment attributes equally. Overall, out-of-pocket costs for treatments were considered by respondents as the most determining factor in making treatment choices. Results have important implications for healthcare policy and will serve to better inform patients and stakeholders involved in the treatment decision-making process about the treatment preferences of PLWH. Clinicians are encouraged to consider shared decision-making to establish the treatment course that best aligns with PLWH's treatment goals.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,1825-1843,,10.2147/PPA.S405288,37525842,#1042,Fifer 2023,,,1

METHODS: We used an iterative process that was guided by health behavior theory and feedback from multiple stakeholder groups including: 1) content input from genetic experts; 2) study team input; 3) review of video storyboards, video example, study logo, recruitment materials, post-test patient preference counseling survey, and additional study surveys; 4) video series development; and 5) intervention review and finalization of study-related materials. RESULTS: The intervention is patient-centered providing convenience and an opportunity for an individual's preferences for post-test counseling delivery. The intervention's efficacy is being determined in a randomized controlled trial compared to conventional genetic counseling for adherence to recommended guidelines and changes in knowledge, perception of breast cancer risk, breast cancer-specific worry, and satisfaction with counseling.

Ordering Eyeglasses Using 3D Head Scan Technology versus Established Online and Storefront Clinic Methods.,Fontaine N; Hanssens JM; Nguyen M; Bérubé O,"SIGNIFICANCE: This study investigates how a new smartphone scanning technology compares with established online and storefront vendors in providing remote measurement and adjustment of prescription eyeglasses. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate a new technology for ordering prescription eyeglasses online. METHODS: Thirty participants with 2.00 to 2.75 D of presbyopia (aged 49 to 74 years) were asked to order eyeglasses with progressive addition lenses from four vendors: one online vendor using a new head scan technology (Topology, San Francisco, CA), two established Web site-based vendors (vendors A and B), and one storefront vendor: Université de Montréal's Vision Clinic (UMVC). The resulting measurements were compared with those of opticians. Participant-reported preferences on visual and physical comfort of eyeglasses were collected after 15-minute trials of eyeglasses from each vendor. RESULTS: Pupillary half-distance measured with Topology matched optician measurements, but online vendors A and B diverged (mean difference, - 0.80 mm [ Z = -2.79; P = .005]). Topology and vendor B segment addition heights were similar to optician measurements, but vendor A diverged (mean, -1.40 mm [ Z = -2.58; P = .01]). The personalization parameter values obtained with Topology were different from optician measurements for pantoscopic angle (-5.30° [ Z = -4.12; P < .001]) and face wrap angle (+1.25° [ Z = -2.94; P = .003]). The UMVC eyeglasses scored best for adjustment (8.71/10 [ Z = -5.53; P < .001]), with Topology coming second (7.23/10). Topology scores were equivalent to UMVC scores for all eight items of patient-reported preferences (nonparametric Friedman analysis of variance, P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Basic lens centration measurements obtained with Topology compare well with those of opticians, but some aspects of the methodology for measuring personalization parameters could be improved. In comparison with two established online vendors, resulting measurements with Topology are more consistent. Initial wearer satisfaction with Topology eyeglasses was also better.",2023,May,Optom Vis Sci,100,5,319-327,,10.1097/OPX.0000000000002015,36951831,#1278,Fontaine 2023,,,0
[Participation of Patients in the Development of Clinical Guidelines: A Selective Country Comparison in a Narrative Review].,Kiese-Himmel C,"AIM: A clinical practice guideline aims to optimize patient care by recommending diagnostic or treatment pathways, based on the best available research and practical experience. Therefore, the needs and preferences of patients and their families should be incorporated. The aim of this study was to examine regulations and standards of patient involvement in guideline development, using a selective comparison of countries. METHOD: Information was extracted from publicly available websites and guidelines development manuals for the United Kingdom (UK), the United States, Canada, and Australia. They were compared and discussed in a narrative review. RESULTS: In the UK, at least two people from among patients or the public must be involved in all guideline development committees and during all stages of the development process. The US National Academy of Medicine recommends active participation in guideline development groups by patients with disease-specific experience and patient representatives from the public. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care wants patient preferences to be involved, especially in the development of final guideline recommendations and usability testing. In Australia, guidelines receive the approval or seal of approval of the National Health and Medical Research Council if at least one patient representative can be shown to have been a member of the committee and to have been involved in the entire process of guideline development. CONCLUSION: The selective country comparison shows that patient involvement in guideline development and the binding nature of the rules vary considerably, and that there are no uniform standards for involvement. Many issues of involvement are unresolved, and special sensitivity will be needed to bring together the life and experiences of patients/laypersons and the medical system on an equal footing.",2023,Nov,Gesundheitswesen,85,11,967-974,,10.1055/a-2057-0422,37327814,#739,Kiese-Himmel 2023,,,0
Best-worst scaling preferences among patients with well-controlled epilepsy: Pilot results.,Terman SW; Aschmann HE; Hutton DW; Burke JF,"Epilepsy is a common, serious condition. Fortunately, seizure risk decreases with increasing seizure-free time on antiseizure medications (ASMs). Eventually, patients may consider whether to stop ASMs, which requires weighing treatment benefit versus burden. We developed a questionnaire to quantify patient preferences relevant to ASM decision-making. Respondents rated how concerning they would finding relevant items (e.g., seizure risks, side effects, cost) on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, 0-100) and then repeatedly chose the most and least concerning item from subsets (best-worst scaling, BWS). We pretested with neurologists, then recruited adults with epilepsy who were seizure-free at least one year. Primary outcomes were recruitment rate, and qualitative and Likert-based feedback. Secondary outcomes included VAS ratings and best-minus-worst scores. Thirty-one of 60 (52%) contacted patients completed the study. Most patients felt VAS questions were clear (28; 90%), easy to use (27; 87%), and assessed preferences well (25; 83%). Corresponding results for BWS questions were 27 (87%), 29 (97%), and 23 (77%). Physicians suggested adding a 'warmup' question showing a completed example and simplifying terminology. Patients suggested ways to clarify instructions. Cost, inconvenience of taking medication, and laboratory monitoring were the least concerning items. Cognitive side effects and a 50% seizure risk in the next year were the most concerning items. Twelve (39%) of patients made at least one 'inconsistent choice' for example ranking a higher seizure risk as lower concern compared with a lower seizure risk, though 'inconsistent choices' represented only 3% of all question blocks. Our recruitment rate was favorable, most patients agreed the survey was clear, and we describe areas for improvement.

Study protocol for a cross-sectional online survey investigating patient preferences and experiences of waiting for elective cardiac surgery.,Russo M; Watson K; Richards K; Olive RR; Krausova B; Kumar R; Burridge J; Goulding L; Chua KC; Hardy D; Vassilios A; Kamran B; Bhudia S; Alia N; Habib K; Sevdalis N; Petrou M,"INTRODUCTION: Being on a waiting list for elective (planned) cardiac surgery can be physically and psychologically challenging for patients. Research suggests that stress associated with waiting for surgery is dependent on different individual and contextual factors. However, most data on patients' experiences of waiting for surgery and preferences for waiting list management derives from non-cardiac clinical populations. The aim of the current study is to explore patients' experiences of being on a waiting list for elective cardiac surgery, and their views on how the waiting experience could be improved in the future. This work will inform the patient management strategy during the waiting period for surgery across the four major hospitals in London directly involved in this study, and potentially beyond by transferring learning to other services. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a mixed-methods study that will collect quantitative and qualitative data using a cross-sectional online survey. Patients who are on waiting lists for elective surgery across four major cardiac surgery departments in London hospitals, and are at least 18 years old, will be invited by their healthcare team via text message or letter to complete the survey. The target sample size of non-randomly selected participants will be 268. Bivariable and multivariable regression models will be used to assess associations between survey items measuring the impact of the cardiac condition on specific life domains (eg, daily activities, social and family relationships, hobbies, sexual life), anxiety and depression symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 and survey items evaluating experiences of health services. Data on experience and preferences for improvements to the waiting experience will be analysed with qualitative content analysis using an inductive approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was reviewed and granted ethical approval by the East of England-East Cambridge Research Ethics Committee. Findings from this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, a research website and social media and with an online event engaging patients, members of the public, healthcare professionals and other relevant stakeholders.

Limited versus full sternotomy for aortic valve replacement.,Kirmani BH; Jones SG; Muir A; Malaisrie SC; Chung DA; Williams RJ; Akowuah E,"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve disease is a common condition easily treatable with cardiac surgery. This is conventionally performed by opening the sternum ('median sternotomy') and replacing the valve under cardiopulmonary bypass. Median sternotomy is well tolerated, but as less invasive options become available, the efficacy of limited incisions has been called into question. In particular, the effects of reducing the visibility and surgical access have raised safety concerns with regard to the placement of cannulae, venting of the heart, epicardial wire placement, and de-airing of the heart at the end of the procedure. These difficulties may increase operating times, affecting outcome. The benefits of smaller incisions are thought to include decreased pain; improved respiratory mechanics; reductions in wound infections, bleeding, and need for transfusion; shorter intensive care stay; better cosmesis; and a quicker return to normal activity. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2017, with seven new studies. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement via a limited sternotomy versus conventional aortic valve replacement via median sternotomy in people with aortic valve disease requiring surgical replacement. SEARCH METHODS: We performed searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase from inception to August 2021, with no language limitations. We also searched two clinical trials registries and manufacturers' websites. We reviewed references of primary studies to identify any further studies of relevance. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials comparing aortic valve replacement via a median sternotomy versus aortic valve replacement via a limited sternotomy. We excluded trials that performed other minimally invasive incisions such as mini-thoracotomies, port access, transapical, transfemoral or robotic procedures. Although some well-conducted prospective and retrospective case-control and cohort studies exist, these were not included in this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial papers to extract data, assess quality, and identify risk of bias. A third review author provided arbitration where required. We determined the certainty of evidence using the GRADE methodology and summarised results of patient-relevant outcomes in a summary of findings table. MAIN RESULTS: The review included 14 trials with 1395 participants. Most studies had at least two domains at high risk of bias. We analysed 14 outcomes investigating the effects of minimally invasive limited upper hemi-sternotomy on aortic valve replacement as compared to surgery performed via full median sternotomy. Upper hemi-sternotomy may have little to no effect on mortality versus full median sternotomy (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.94; 10 studies, 985 participants; low-certainty evidence). Upper hemi-sternotomy for aortic valve replacement may increase cardiopulmonary bypass time slightly, although the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference (MD) 10.63 minutes, 95% CI 3.39 to 17.88; 10 studies, 1043 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and may increase aortic cross-clamp time slightly (MD 6.07 minutes, 95% CI 0.79 to 11.35; 12 studies, 1235 participants; very low-certainty evidence), although the evidence is very uncertain. Most studies had at least two domains at high risk of bias. Postoperative blood loss was probably lower in the upper hemi-sternotomy group (MD -153 mL, 95% CI -246 to -60; 8 studies, 767 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence suggested that there may be no change in pain scores by upper hemi-sternotomy (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.19, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.04; 5 studies, 649 participants). Upper hemi-sternotomy may result in little to no difference in quality of life (MD 0.03 higher, 95% CI 0 to 0.06 higher; 4 studies, 624 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two studies reporting index admission costs concluded that limited sternotomy may be more costly at index admission in the UK National Health Service (MD 1190 GBP more, 95% CI 420 GBP to 1970 GBP, 2 studies, 492 participants; low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence was of very low to moderate certainty. Sample sizes were small and underpowered to demonstrate differences in some outcomes. Clinical heterogeneity was also noted. Considering these limitations, there may be little to no effect on mortality. Differences in extracorporeal support times are uncertain, comparing upper hemi-sternotomy to full sternotomy for aortic valve replacement. Before widespread adoption of the minimally invasive approach can be recommended, there is a need for a well-designed and adequately powered prospective randomised controlled trial. Such a study would benefit from also performing a robust cost analysis. Growing patient preference for minimally invasive techniques merits thorough quality of life analyses to be included as end points, as well as quantitative measures of physiological reserve.",2023,Dec,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,12,12,CD011793,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02272621ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT04012060,10.1002/14651858.CD011793.pub3,38054555,#582,Kirmani 2023,,,0
Defining inappropriate thyroid biopsy?-Proposed definition based on clinical evidence and stakeholder engagement.,Nguyen TA; Brito JP; Singh Ospina N,"PURPOSE: Identify factors that can be used to assess the appropriateness of a thyroid biopsy and propose a pathway to define inappropriate thyroid biopsies in practice. METHODS: We identified factors utilized in clinical guidelines and existing literature to determine the clinical indications for a thyroid biopsy. Subsequently, we assembled a multidisciplinary panel of experts, including patients, clinicians, researchers, and quality experts, to integrate these factors and develop a pathway for assessing the appropriateness of thyroid biopsies. RESULTS: Through literature review and stakeholder engagement, we identified multiple factors to determine if a thyroid biopsy is necessary: ultrasound risk assessment, presence of compressive symptoms and/or clinical suspicion of high-risk thyroid cancer, life expectancy, comorbidity burden, surgical risk, personal risk factors for thyroid cancer, thyroid function levels, local resources and medical expertise and patient values and preferences. We proposed a multiple-tier classification for the appropriateness of thyroid biopsy that begins with ultrasound findings (e.g., size, thyroid cancer risk) and encompasses the evaluation of additional patient-specific factors. CONCLUSION: Assessment of the appropriateness of a thyroid biopsy is possible. Although, thyroid nodule ultrasound risk assessment is a pivotal factor for this assessment, additional factors should be considered (e.g., life expectancy, personal risk factors for thyroid cancer, patient preferences). Yet, additional efforts are needed to operationalize the objective implementation of these factors in clinical practice.",2024,Feb,Endocrine,,,,,10.1007/s12020-024-03727-1,38407695,#340,Nguyen 2024,,,0
Effectiveness of digital care platform CMyLife for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia: results of a patient-preference trial.,Verweij L; Ector GICG; Smit Y; van Vlijmen B; van der Reijden BA; Hermens RPMG; Blijlevens NMA,"BACKGROUND: Two most important factors determining treatment success in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are adequate medication compliance and molecular monitoring albeit still being suboptimal. The CMyLife platform is an eHealth innovation, co-created with and for CML patients, aiming to improve their care, leading to an increased quality of life and the opportunity of hospital-free care. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effectiveness of CMyLife in terms of information provision, patient empowerment, medication compliance, molecular monitoring, and quality of life. METHODS: Effectiveness of CMyLife was explored using a patient-preference trial. Upon completion of the baseline questionnaire, participants actively used (intervention group) or did not actively use (questionnaire group) the CMyLife platform for at least 6 months, after which they completed the post-intervention questionnaire. Scores between the intervention group and the questionnaire group were compared with regard to the within-subject change between baseline and post-measurement using Generalized Estimating Equation models. RESULTS: At baseline, 33 patients were enrolled in the questionnaire group and 75 in the intervention group. Online health information knowledge improved significantly when actively using CMyLife and patients felt more empowered. No significant improvements were found regarding medication compliance and molecular monitoring, which were already outstanding. Self-reported effectiveness showed that patients experienced that using CMyLife improved their medication compliance and helped them to oversee their molecular monitoring. Patients using CMyLife reported more symptoms but were better able to manage these. CONCLUSIONS: Since hospital-free care has shown to be feasible in time of the COVID-19 pandemic, eHealth-based innovations such as CMyLife could be a solution to maintain the quality of care and make current oncological health care services more sustainable.

Fracture risk and assessment in adults with cancer.,Ye C; Leslie WD,"Individuals with cancer face unique risk factors for osteoporosis and fractures. Clinicians must consider the additive effects of cancer-specific factors, including treatment-induced bone loss, and premorbid fracture risk, utilizing FRAX score and bone mineral densitometry when available. Pharmacologic therapy should be offered as per cancer-specific guidelines, when available, or local general osteoporosis guidelines informed by clinical judgment and patient preferences. Our objective was to review and summarize the epidemiologic burden of osteoporotic fracture risk and fracture risk assessment in adults with cancer, and recommended treatment thresholds for cancer treatment-induced bone loss, with specific focus on breast, prostate, thyroid, gynecological, multiple myeloma, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This narrative review was informed by PubMed searches to July 25, 2022, that combined terms for cancer, stem cell transplantation, fracture, bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular bone score, FRAX, Garvan nomogram or fracture risk calculator, QFracture, prediction, and risk factors. The literature informs that cancer can impact bone health in numerous ways, leading to both systemic and localized decreases in BMD. Many cancer treatments can have detrimental effects on bone health. In particular, hormone deprivation therapies for hormone-responsive cancers such as breast cancer and prostate cancer, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant for hematologic malignancies, adversely affect bone turnover, resulting in osteoporosis and fractures. Surgical treatments such as hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for gynecological cancers can also lead to deleterious effects on bone health. Radiation therapy is well documented to cause localized bone loss and fractures. Few studies have validated the use of fracture risk prediction tools in the cancer population. Guidelines on cancer-specific treatment thresholds are limited, and major knowledge gaps still exist in fracture risk and fracture risk assessment in patients with cancer. Despite the limitations of current knowledge on fracture risk assessment and treatment thresholds in patients with cancer, clinicians must consider the additive effects of bone damaging factors to which these patients are exposed and their premorbid fracture risk profile. Pharmacologic treatment should be offered as per cancer-specific guidelines when available, or per local general osteoporosis guidelines, in accordance with clinical judgment and patient preferences.",2023,Mar,Osteoporos Int,34,3,449-466,,10.1007/s00198-022-06631-4,36512057,#1469,Ye 2023,,,0
When should electronic medical records reminders for cancer screening stop?-Results from a national physician survey.,Schoenborn NL; Pollack CE; Boyd CM,"BACKGROUND: Many older adults are screened for breast and colorectal cancers beyond guideline recommended thresholds. Electronic medical record (EMR) reminders are commonly used to prompt cancer screening. Behavioral economics theory suggests that changing the default settings for these reminders can be effective to reduce over-screening. We examined physician perspectives about acceptable thresholds for stopping EMR cancer screening reminders. METHODS: In a national survey of 1200 primary care physicians (PCP) and 600 gynecologists randomly selected from the AMA Masterfile, we asked physicians to choose whether EMR reminders for cancer screening should stop based on a list of criteria that included age, life expectancy, specific serious illnesses, and functional limitations. Physicians could choose multiple responses. PCPs were randomized to questions about breast or colorectal cancer screening. RESULTS: A total of 592 physicians participated (adjusted response rate 54.1%). 54.6% chose age and 71.8% chose life expectancy as criteria for stopping EMR reminders; only 30.6% chose functional limitations. Regarding age thresholds, 52.4% chose ages ≤75, 42.0% chose a threshold between 75 and 85, 5.6% would not stop reminders even at age 85. Regarding life expectancy thresholds, 32.0% chose ≥10 years, 53.1% chose a threshold between 5 and 9 years, 14.9% would not stop reminders even when life expectancy is <5 years. CONCLUSIONS: We found that many physicians would continue EMR reminders for cancer screening even in light of older age, limited life expectancy, and functional limitations. This may reflect reluctance to stop cancer screening and/or reluctance to stop EMR reminders so that physicians can retain control to decide for individual patients, for example, to assess patient preference and ability to tolerate treatment. There was consensus for stopping EMR reminders at ages 85+ and <5-year life expectancy. Interventions that seek to reduce over-screening by suppressing EMR reminders may be important for these groups but may have limited physician buy-in outside these thresholds.",2023,Sep,J Am Geriatr Soc,71,9,2878-2885,,10.1111/jgs.18412,37224393,#937,Schoenborn 2023,,,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The KUOS registry of AS for PC (KUOS-AS-PC) was organized in May 2019 and comprises multiple institutions nationwide. The eligibility criteria were as follows: patients with (1) pathologically proven PC; (2) pre-biopsy prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤20 ng/mL; (3) International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 1 or 2 (no cribriform pattern 4); (4) clinical T stage ≤T2c; (5) positive core ratio ≤50%; and (6) maximal cancer involvement in the core ≤50%. Detailed longitudinal clinical information, including multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging and disease-specific outcomes, was recorded. RESULTS: From May 2019 to June 2021, 296 patients were enrolled, and 284 were analyzed. The mean±standard deviation (SD) age at enrollment was 68.7±8.2 years. The median follow-up period was 11.2 months (5.9-16.8 mo). Majority of patients had pre-biopsy PSA ≤10 ng/mL (91.2%), PSA density <0.2 ng/mL² (79.7%), ISUP grade group 1 (94.4%), single positive core (65.7%), maximal cancer involvement in the core ≤20% (78.1%), and clinical T stage of T1c or lower (72.9%). Fifty-two (18.3%) discontinued AS for various reasons. Interventions included radical prostatectomy (80.8%), transurethral prostatectomy (5.8%), primary androgen deprivation therapy (5.8%), radiation (5.8%), and focal therapy (1.9%). The mean±SD time to intervention was 8.9±5.2 months. The reasons for discontinuation included pathologic reclassification (59.6%), patient preference (25.0%), and radiologic reclassification (9.6%).

Identifying Barriers to Post-Acute Care Referral and Characterizing Negative Patient Preferences Among Hospitalized Older Adults Using Natural Language Processing.,Kennedy EE; Davoudi A; Hwang S; Freda PJ; Urbanowicz R; Bowles KH; Mowery DL,"Our objective was to detect common barriers to post-acute care (B2PAC) among hospitalized older adults using natural language processing (NLP) of clinical notes from patients discharged home when a clinical decision support system recommended post-acute care. We annotated B2PAC sentences from discharge planning notes and developed an NLP classifier to identify the highest-value B2PAC class (negative patient preferences). Thirteen machine learning models were compared with Amazon's AutoGluon deep learning model. The study included 594 acute care notes from 100 patient encounters (1156 sentences contained 11 B2PAC) in a large academic health system. The most frequent and modifiable B2PAC class was negative patient preferences (18.3%). The best supervised model was Extreme Gradient Boosting (F1: 0.859), but the deep learning model performed better (F1: 0.916). Alerting clinicians of negative patient preferences early in the hospitalization can prompt interventions such as patient education to ensure patients receive the right level of care and avoid negative outcomes.",2022,,AMIA Annu Symp Proc,2022,,606-615,,,37128417,#1308,Kennedy 2022,,,0
Cost effectiveness of using trastuzumab biosimilars compared to trastuzumab original drugs to treat breast cancer in a hospital setting.,Barat EC; Arrii MLE; Soubieux-Bourbon A; Daouphars M; Varin R; Tilleul PR,"INTRODUCTION: Subcutaneous (SC) drug administration, such as the Herceptin® in an oncology day hospital reduces the administration time of trastuzumab. In the context of combination therapy administration, this time-saving may be called into question. The challenge posed by the deployment of much less expensive IV biosimilar forms raises questions about the cost-effectiveness of SC administration. METHODS: Using data from a french Diagnostic Related Groups regarding prescriptions of intravenous Herceptin® (HIV), Herceptin® biosimilar IV (BSIV), and Herceptin® subcutaneous (HSC), we conducted two simulations. This simulation involved replacing all HSC with BSIV in combination therapy administration (Simulation 1) and subsequently substituting IV forms with SC forms only when prescribed as monotherapy (Simulation 2). A cost-benefit analysis was conducted based on these two simulations, from the hospital's perspective, for Normandy's population over a 1-year timeframe. RESULTS: In Simulation 1, there was an average cost-saving of €12 per patient per year, but it resulted in a loss of 10140 min, equivalent to 10 min per patient per year when compared to the current situation. Simulation 2 yielded average cost-savings for the hospital amounting to €51 per patient per year, along with a time-saving of 67 min per patient per year compared to the current situation. CONCLUSIONS: The development of a program aimed at optimizing the prescription of Trastuzumab holds the potential to deliver significant cost-savings to hospitals while enhancing the quality of service provided to the patients. This optimization involves using H SC in monotherapy and BS IV in combination therapy administration.",2023,Dec,Breast,72,,103588,,10.1016/j.breast.2023.103588,37857129,#613,Barat 2023,,,0
Nurses' perception of the hospitals' culture and readiness of evidence-based practise integration in the hospital's system in western Ethiopia.,Diriba DC; Tilahun T,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based practise is a method by which healthcare professionals integrate the best available evidence, individual expertise and patient preferences to improve patient safety and utilise quality healthcare. No study was conducted in Ethiopia to assess the nurses' perception of the hospitals' culture and readiness for evidence-based practice integration into the hospital's system. Hence, this study aimed to assess the perception of nurses on the hospitals' culture and readiness of evidence-based practise integration in hospitals' systems in Western Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 412 nurses in six hospitals in western Ethiopia was conducted between December 2022 and February 2023. A 25-item Organisational Culture and Readiness of System-Wide Integration of EBP scale was used, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.94. While 25 is the minimum score, 125 is the maximum; higher scores indicate better hospital culture and readiness for system-wide integration of evidence-based practice. A self-administered data collection technique was used. Descriptive statistics were computed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 25 software. RESULTS: Four hundred and twelve nurses participated in the study. The majority (85.9%) were bachelor's degree holders and over a third (34.7%) worked in primary hospitals. Only a quarter (26.5%) had ever received mentorship from their leader on implementing evidence-based practice. The overall hospital culture and readiness score for system-wide integration of evidence-based practice among nurses in six hospitals was 70.3 ± 17.3. CONCLUSION: The nurses' perception of the hospitals' culture and readiness score for system-wide integration of evidence-based practice in six hospitals in Western Ethiopia was equivocal. There is a need to engage all resources and increase leadership commitment to make evidence-based practice a hospital culture. Further research is warranted to understand the national hospitals' status in establishing and sustaining evidence-based practise culture.",2024,Feb,BMC Nurs,23,1,103,,10.1186/s12912-024-01741-2,38321447,#387,Diriba 2024,,,0
Women's preferences for less active ectopic pregnancy treatment: A discrete choice experiment.,Capmas P; Panjo H; Artignan J; Babelhadj A; Benoist I; Decouzon J; Jarrige C; Leglise M; Renoncet V; Pelletier-Fleury N,"RESEARCH QUESTION: Shared decision-making has become a hallmark of quality care and is increasingly spotlighted in practice guidelines. Little is known about women's views for treatment of less active ectopic pregnancy. What are the preferences of women for less active ectopic pregnancy treatment-related attributes? DESIGN: A discrete choice model with 8 attributes depicting ectopic pregnancy treatment including varying levels of first-line treatment effectiveness, length of hospitalization, cost, length of sick leave, of convalescence, need for surgical management, for emergency care during convalescence and for tube removal was used. Childbearing aged women, i.e. those who might experience an ectopic pregnancy in the future, were recruited. They were asked to choose between hypothetical treatments in 18 choice tasks with different levels of all treatment attributes. A conditional logit McFadden's choice model was performed. The main outcome measure was preference weights for less active ectopic pregnancy treatment-related attributes. RESULTS: A total of 5770 observations from 178 women were analysed. The attributes displaying the highest marginal impacts on women's decisions included: higher rate of first-line treatment effectiveness, lower rate of tube removal, lower rate of surgical management, shorter length of hospitalization and, to a lesser extent, but still significant, shorter length of convalescence, absence of risk of emergency care during convalescence and lower cost. CONCLUSIONS: Trade-offs made by women between the attributes of less active ectopic pregnancy treatment suggest that no treatment option, either medical or surgical, is an obvious preferred option.

Editorial Commentary: Suture Button Fixation for the Latarjet Procedure Is Superior to Screw Fixation.,Chakrabarti MO; Khan M,"An increasing body of evidence suggests that suture button fixation is comparable with screw fixation in Latarjet and potentially associated with reduced graft resorption. Suture button fixation may facilitate performing the Latarjet procedure, particularly when done in an arthroscopic manner. The use of suture button fixation technique theoretically facilitates improved positioning of the graft on the glenoid, as it frees the surgeon from the potential of the soft-tissue envelope to impact positioning of the graft, which can occur with screw-based guides. The bone graft can be shuttled into an optimal position and then tensioned with relative ease in comparison with screw-based techniques. Suture button fixation results in lower complication rates compared with screw fixation; almost one third of the screw fixation complications are hardware-related, and screw fixation results in a high rate of hardware removal. Moreover, the arthroscopic Latarjet suture button literature is published by experienced surgeons. Arthroscopic Latarjet has a significant learning curve, reducing the translatability of studies that report superior findings with any one technique. The generalizability of results reminds us that evidence-based medicine should be practiced through the lens of not only patient preferences, but also through an honest appraisal of a surgeon's own ability.",2023,Dec,Arthroscopy,,,,,10.1016/j.arthro.2023.11.035,38219100,#549,Chakrabarti 2023,,,0
Patient preferences and willingness-to-pay for community pharmacy-led Medicare Part D consultation services: A discrete choice experiment.,Murry LT; Viyurri B; Chapman CG; Witry MJ; Kennelty KA; Nayakankuppam D; Doucette WR; Urmie J,"INTRODUCTION: Community pharmacies currently offer Medicare Part D consultation services, often at no-cost. Despite facilitating plan-switching behavior, identifying potential cost-savings, and increasing medication adherence, patient uptake of these services remains low. OBJECTIVES: To investigate patient preferences for specific service-offering attributes and marginal willingness-to-pay (mWTP) for an enhanced community pharmacy Medicare Part D consultation service. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) guided by the SERVQUAL framework was developed and administered using a national online survey panel. Study participants were English-speaking adults (≥65 years) residing in the United States enrolled in a Medicare Part D or Medicare Advantage plan and had filled a prescription at a community pharmacy within the last 12 months. An orthogonal design resulted in 120 paired-choice tasks distributed equally across 10 survey blocks. Data were analyzed using mixed logit and latent class models. RESULTS: In total, 540 responses were collected, with the average age of respondents being 71 years. The majority of respondents were females (60%) and reported taking four or more prescription medication (51%). Service attribute levels with the highest utility were: 15-min intervention duration (0.392), discussion of services + a follow-up phone call (0.069), in-person at the pharmacy (0.328), provided by a pharmacist the patient knew (0.578), and no-cost (3.382). The attribute with the largest mWTP value was a service provided by a pharmacist the participant knew ($8.42). Latent class analysis revealed that patient preferences for service attributes significantly differed by gender and difficulty affording prescription medications. CONCLUSIONS: Quantifying patient preference using discrete choice methodology provides pharmacies with information needed to design service offerings that balance patient preference and sustainability. Pharmacies may consider providing interventions at no-cost to subsets of patients placing high importance on a service cost attribute. Further, patient preference for 15-min interventions may inform Medicare Part D service delivery and facilitate service sustainability.",2023,May,Res Social Adm Pharm,19,5,764-772,,10.1016/j.sapharm.2023.01.008,36710174,#1289,Murry 2023,,,1
Forensic Medical Examination After Sexual Violence: Implications Based on Victims' Perceptions.,Berger L; Tuschy B; Stefanovic S; Yen K; Weiss C; Sütterlin M; Spaich S; Berlit S,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The objective of this study was to assess the perception of the forensic medical examination (FME) by victims of sexual violence. Based on patient-related outcomes gained in terms of personnel, chronological and spatial parameters, an additional aim was to derive improved examination procedures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 49 sexually assaulted women were enrolled in this study. After standardized FME by a forensic doctor followed by a gynecologist, women were asked to complete a questionnaire addressing general perception, preferences regarding attending staff's sex, sequence and time frame of the examinations performed. The attending gynecologist also completed a questionnaire addressing demographic and medical parameters of the patient as well as assault-related information. RESULTS: The examination setting in general was evaluated positively. Nevertheless, 52% of examined victims perceived the FME as an additional psychological burden. Overall, 85% of the affected women preferred a female forensic physician and 76% a female gynecologist to perform the examination. When women said they experienced a violation of their privacy during the gynecological examination, a male was more often present (60% vs. 35%, p=0.0866). Regarding the sequence of the examination components, 65% of the victims preferred to start with their medical history followed by the forensic and then the gynecological examination. CONCLUSION: Forensic medical and gynecological examination after sexual assault is an essential procedure, yet it is a potentially further traumatizing experience for the victim. The identified patient preferences should be taken into account in order to diminish further trauma.",2023,Mar-Apr,In Vivo,37,2,848-857,,10.21873/invivo.13152,36881047,#1432,Berger 2023,,,0
Using discrete choice experiment to investigate patients' and parents' preferences for initiating ADHD medication.,Khan MU; Balbontin C; Bliemer M; Aslani P,"BACKGROUND: The decision to initiate medication is complex and is influenced by a variety of factors. There is limited information on the relative importance of factors that influence the initiation of ADHD medication. AIMS: To investigate the factors, and their relative importance, that influence the decision to initiate medication in adults, and parents of children, with ADHD. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was conducted using eight choice tasks made up of five attributes that described the outcomes of initiating medication. A mixed multinomial logit model was used to estimate preferences for medication. RESULTS: Respondents' overall preferences for initiating medication were negative (Mean (β)= -0.72705, p < 0.1), however, significant heterogeneity was noted in preferences (SD: 0.93604, p < 0.001). Side-effects were the most important factor for both adults (Relative importance (RI) = 40.39%) and parents (RI = 41.99%). Improvement in education had a greater weighting in adults' decision-making compared to parents (RI = 36.93% vs 30.47%) while improvement in aggressive (RI = 14.38% vs 11.84%) and social behaviour (RI = 12.59% vs 10.37%) was more important to parents. CONCLUSIONS: Important differences in preferences of patients and parents were identified, highlighting that the decision to initiate medication is influenced differently in different individuals and groups.",2023,Apr,J Ment Health,32,2,373-385,,10.1080/09638237.2021.1979495,34632936,#1390,Khan 2023,,,1
Preferences of Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis for Intrathecal Drug Delivery: Choosing between an Implanted Drug-Delivery Device and Therapeutic Lumbar Puncture.,Seo J; Saurkar S; Fernandez GS; Das A; Goutman SA; Heidenreich S,"BACKGROUND: Novel intrathecal treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may require delivery using lumbar puncture (LP). Implanted drug-delivery devices (IDDDs) could be an alternative but little is known about patients' preferences for intrathecal drug-delivery methods. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to elicit preferences of patients with ALS for routine LP and IDDD use. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) and a threshold technique (TT) exercise were conducted online among patients with ALS in the US and Europe. In the DCE, patients made trade-offs between administration attributes. Attributes were identified from qualitative interviews. The TT elicited maximum acceptable risks (MARs) of complications from device implantation surgery. DCE data were analyzed using mixed logit to quantify relative attribute importance (RAI) as the maximum contribution of each attribute to a preference, and to estimate MARs of device failure. TT data were analyzed using interval regression. Four scenarios of LP and IDDD were compared. RESULTS: Participants (N = 295) had a mean age of 57.7 years; most (74.2%) were diagnosed < 3 years ago. Preferences were affected by device failure risk (RAI 28.6%), administration frequency (26.4%), administration risk (19.7%), overall duration (17.8%), and appointment location (7.5%). Patients accepted a 5.6% device failure risk to reduce overall duration from 2 h to 30 min and a 3.6% risk for administration in a local clinic instead of a hospital. The average MAR of complications from implantation surgery was 29%. Patients preferred IDDD over LP in three of four scenarios. CONCLUSION: Patients considered an IDDD as a valuable alternative to LP in multiple clinical settings.",2024,Mar,Patient,17,2,161-177,,10.1007/s40271-023-00665-4,38097873,#304,Seo 2024,,,1
Implementing Shared Decision-Making for Multiple Sclerosis: The MS-SUPPORT Tool.,Col NF; Solomon AJ; Alvarez E; Pbert L; Ionete C; BerriosMorales I; Chester J; Kutz C; Iwuchukwu C; Livingston T; Springmann V; Col HV; Ngo LH,"BACKGROUND: Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) offer opportunities to improve the course of multiple sclerosis (MS), but decisions about treatment are difficult. People with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) want more involvement in decisions about DMTs, but new approaches are needed to support shared decision-making (SDM) because of the number of treatment options and the range of outcomes affected by treatment. We designed a patient-centered tool, MS-SUPPORT, to facilitate SDM for pwMS. We sought to evaluate the feasibility and impact of MS-SUPPORT on decisions about disease modifying treatments (DMTs), SDM processes, and quality-of-life. METHODS: This multisite randomized controlled trial compared the SDM intervention (MS-SUPPORT) to control (usual care) over a 12-month period. English-speaking adults with relapsing MS were eligible if they had an upcoming MS appointment and an email address. To evaluate clinician perspectives, participants' MS clinicians were invited to participate. Patients were referred between November 11, 2019 and October 23, 2020 by their MS clinician or a patient advocacy organization (the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America). MS-SUPPORT is an online, interactive, evidence-based decision aid that was co-created with pwMS. It clarifies patient treatment goals and values and provides tailored information about MS, DMTs, and adherence. Viewed by patients before their clinic appointment, MS-SUPPORT generates a personalized summary of the patient's treatment goals and preferences, adherence, DMT use, and clinical situation to share with their MS clinician. Outcomes (DMT utilization, adherence, quality-of-life, and SDM) were assessed at enrollment, post-MS-SUPPORT, post-appointment, and quarterly for 1 year. RESULTS: Participants included 501 adults with MS from across the USA (84.6% female, 83% white) and 34 of their MS clinicians (47% neurologists, 41% Nurse Practitioners, 12% Physician Assistants). Among the 203 patients who completed MS-SUPPORT, most (88.2%) reported they would recommend it to others and that it helped them talk to their doctor (85.2%), understand their options (82.3%) and the importance of taking DMTs as prescribed (82.3%). Among non-users of DMTs at baseline, the probability ratio of current DMT use consistently trended higher over one-year follow-up in the MS-SUPPORT group (1.30 [0.86-1.96]), as did the cumulative probability of starting a DMT within 6-months, with shorter time-to-start (46 vs 90 days, p=0.24). Among the 222 responses from 34 participating clinicians, more clinicians in the MS-SUPPORT group (vs control) trended towards recommending their patient start a DMT (9 of 108 (8%) vs 5 of 109 (5%), respectively, p=0.26). Adherence (no missed doses) to daily-dosed DMTs was higher in the MS-SUPPORT group (81.25% vs 56.41%, p=.026). Fewer patients forgot their doses (p=.046). The MS-SUPPORT group (vs control) reported 1.7 fewer days/month of poor mental health (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: MS-SUPPORT was strongly endorsed by patients and is feasible to use in clinical settings. MS-SUPPORT increased the short-term probability of taking and adhering to a DMT, and improved long-term mental health. Study limitations include selection bias, response bias, social desirability bias, and recall bias. Exploring approaches to reinforcement and monitoring its implementation in real-world settings should provide further insights into the value and utility of this new SDM tool.",2023,Dec,Mult Scler Relat Disord,80,,105092,,10.1016/j.msard.2023.105092,37931489,#603,Col 2023,,,0
Using Discrete Choice Experiments to Quantify Patient Preferences.,O'Hara NN; Sciadini MF,"Discrete choice experiments are a robust technique for quantifying preferences. With this method, respondents are presented with a series of hypothetical comparisons described by attributes with varying levels. The aggregated choices from respondents can be used to infer the relative importance of the described attributes and acceptable trade-offs between attributes. The data generated from discrete choice experiments can aid surgeons in aligning patient values with treatment decisions and support the design of research that is responsive to patient preferences. This article summarizes the application of discrete choice experiments to orthopaedics. We share best practices for designing discrete choice experiments and options for reporting study results. Finally, we suggest opportunities for this method within our field.",2024,Jan,J Am Acad Orthop Surg,32,1,e9-e16,,10.5435/JAAOS-D-22-01125,37647520,#530,O'Hara 2024,,,1
Which Factors Are Considered by Patients When Considering Total Joint Arthroplasty? A Discrete-choice Experiment.,Salimy MS; Humphrey TJ; Katakam A; Melnic CM; Heng M; Bedair HS,"BACKGROUND: TKA and THA are major surgical procedures, and they are associated with the potential for serious, even life-threatening complications. Patients must weigh the risks of these complications against the benefits of surgery. However, little is known about the relative importance patients place on the potential complications of surgery compared with any potential benefit the procedures may achieve. Furthermore, patient preferences may often be discordant with surgeon preferences regarding the treatment decision-making process. A discrete-choice experiment (DCE) is a quantitative survey technique designed to elicit patient preferences by presenting patients with two or more hypothetical scenarios. Each scenario is composed of several attributes or factors, and the relative extent to which respondents prioritize these attributes can be quantified to assess preferences when making a decision, such as whether to pursue lower extremity arthroplasty. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In this DCE, we asked: (1) Which patient-related factors (such as pain and functional level) and surgery-related factors (such as the risk of infection, revision, or death) are influential in patients' decisions about whether to undergo lower extremity arthroplasty? (2) Which of these factors do patients emphasize the most when making this decision? METHODS: A DCE was designed with the following attributes: pain; physical function; return to work; and infection risks, reoperation, implant failure leading to premature revision, deep vein thrombosis, and mortality. From October 2021 to March 2022, we recruited all new patients to two arthroplasty surgeons' clinics who were older than 18 years and scheduled for a consultation for knee- or hip-related complaints who had no previous history of a primary TKA or THA. A total of 56% (292 of 517) of new patients met the inclusion criteria and were approached with the opportunity to complete the DCE. Among the cohort, 51% (150 of 292) of patients completed the DCE. Patients were administered the DCE, which consisted of 10 hypothetical scenarios that had the patient decide between a surgical and nonsurgical outcome, each consisting of varying levels of eight attributes (such as infection, reoperation, and ability to return to work). A subsequent demographic questionnaire followed this assessment. To answer our first research question about the patient-related and surgery-related factors that most influence patients' decisions to undergo lower extremity arthroplasty, we used a conditional logit regression to control for potentially confounding attributes from within the DCE and determine which variables shifted a patient's determination to pursue surgery. To answer our second question, about which of these factors received the greatest priority by patients, we compared the relevant importance of each factor, as determined by each factor's beta coefficient, against each other influential factor. A larger absolute value of beta coefficient reflects a relatively higher degree of importance placed on a variable compared with other variables within our study. Of the respondents, 57% (85 of 150) were women, and the mean age at the time of participation was 64 ± 10 years. Most respondents (95% [143 of 150]) were White. Regarding surgery, 38% (57 of 150) were considering THA, 59% (88 of 150) were considering TKA, and 3% (5 of 150) were considering both. Among the cohort, 49% (74 of 150) of patients reported their average pain level as severe, or 7 to 10 on a scale from 0 to 10, and 47% (71 of 150) reported having 50% of full physical function. RESULTS: Variables that were influential to respondents when deciding on lower extremity total joint arthroplasty were improvement from severe pain to minimal pain (β coefficient: -0.59 [95% CI -0.72 to -0.46]; p < 0.01), improvement in physical function level from 50% to 100% (β: -0.80 [95% CI -0.9 to -0.7]; p < 0.01), ability to return to work versus inability to return (β: -0.38 [95% CI -0.48 to -0.28]; p < 0.01), and the surgery-related factor of risk of infection (β: -0.22 [95% CI -0.30 to -0.14]; p < 0.01). Improvement in physical function from 50% to 100% was the most important for patients making this decision because it had the largest absolute coefficient value of -0.80. To improve physical function from 50% to 100% and reduce pain from severe to minimal because of total joint arthroplasty, patients were willing to accept a hypothetical absolute (and not merely an incrementally increased) 37% and 27% risk of infection, respectively. When we stratified our analysis by respondents' preoperative pain levels, we identified that only patients with severe pain at the time of their appointment found the risk of infection influential in their decision-making process (β: -0.27 [95% CI -0.37 to -0.17]; p = 0.01) and were willing to accept a 24% risk of infection to improve their physical functioning from 50% to 100%. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that patients consider pain alleviation, physical function improvement, and infection risk to be the most important attributes when considering total joint arthroplasty. Patients with severe baseline pain demonstrated a willingness to take on a hypothetically high infection risk as a tradeoff for improved physical function or pain relief. Because patients seemed to prioritize postoperative physical function so highly in our study, it is especially important that surgeons customize their presentations about the likelihood an individual patient will achieve a substantial functional improvement as part of any office visit where arthroplasty is discussed. Future studies should focus on quantitatively assessing patients' understanding of surgical risks after a surgical consultation, especially in patients who may be the most risk tolerant. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Surgeons should be aware that patients with the most limited physical function and the highest baseline pain levels are more willing to accept the more potentially life-threatening and devastating risks that accompany total joint arthroplasty, specifically infection. The degree to which patients seemed to undervalue the harms of infection (based on our knowledge and perception of those harms) suggests that surgeons need to take particular care in explaining the degree to which a prosthetic joint infection can harm or kill patients who develop one.",2023,Mar,Clin Orthop Relat Res,481,3,427-437,,10.1097/CORR.0000000000002358,36111881,#1491,Salimy 2023,,,1
The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of outpatient clinic services in East Jerusalem hospitals: patients' perspectives.,Ahmead M; Daghlas F,"BACKGROUND: Due to the decreased availability, accessibility, and quality of services, the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the healthcare system. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients' perceptions of healthcare have changed, and out-patient visits to clinics have decreased. As part of the COVID-19 outbreak in East Jerusalem, this study aims to assess how patients perceive the way that outpatient clinic services were delivered before and during COVID-19 outbreak. METHODOLOGY: Convenience sampling and self-reported questionnaires were used in a cross-sectional study. Three hundred people from three significant outpatient clinic hospitals in East Jerusalem-Al-Makassed Hospital, Augusta Victoria Hospital, and Sant-Joseph Hospital- made up the sample. Multivariate tests, frequencies, and percentages were used in the statistical analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that the most of the participants (98.6%) had negative opinion when the current situation is compared with before the COVID-19 period in terms of accessibility, availability of resources, quality of care, attitudes and patient's preference. Finally, multivariate analysis indicated a significant relationship between participant opinion and education level and participants with educational levels of 12 study years or less had more positive opinions of the delivery of the healthcare system during the COVID-19 outbreak period than the group with more than 12 study years. Also, the multivariate analysis revealed a significant `relationship between participant opinion and the duration of the illness as those with years of illness and less had more negative opinion toward the delivery of the healthcare system than those with more than 3 years of illness. CONCLUSION: This study found that when the current situation during the COVID-19 outbreak is compared to before the COVID-19 period in terms of accessibility, availability of resources, quality of care, attitudes, and patient preferences, the majority of the participants with chronic diseases or cancer had a negative opinion. Policymakers and health managers should enhance patient preferences and attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic and other pandemics by increasing accessibility, availability of health resources, and the quality of healthcare.",2023,,Front Public Health,11,,1252449,,10.3389/fpubh.2023.1252449,38074699,#660,Ahmead 2023,,,0
Barriers and enablers to deprescribing of older adults and their caregivers: a systematic review and meta-synthesis.,Bolt J; Abdoulrezzak R; Inglis C,"PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to identify the barriers and enablers to deprescribing from the viewpoint of community-dwelling older adults and their caregivers. METHODS: This meta-synthesis included a systematic review of the literature and an inductive thematic synthesis. Medline and EMBASE were searched for studies that qualitatively explored the perspectives of older adults or their caregivers on deprescribing. Studies had to use qualitative methodologies and include community-dwelling adults (or their caregivers) aged 60 years or older who were taking one or more chronic medications. The quality of studies was assessed using the CASP tool. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in the meta-synthesis. All studies included older adults, and 3 included caregivers or companions. Four barriers were identified: favorable perceptions of medications, fear of medication discontinuation, the complexity of the healthcare system and discouragement from healthcare professionals; and seven enablers were identified: medication safety concerns, patient autonomy and confidence, education, follow-up, deprescribing strategies, relationships with physicians, and patient-perceived benefits of deprescribing. CONCLUSION: Multiple barriers and enablers to deprescribing exist within the older adult population. Health system complexity and direct discouragement from healthcare providers were barriers uniquely identified in the older adult population. This population would benefit from interventions to increase their medication literacy, confidence, and autonomy in the deprescribing journey.",2023,Dec,Eur Geriatr Med,14,6,1211-1222,,10.1007/s41999-023-00879-7,37874489,#610,Bolt 2023,,,0
Prognostication for Patients Receiving Palliative Radiation Therapy.,Sun S; Krishnan M; Alcorn S,"Estimation of patient prognosis plays a central role in guiding decision making for the palliative management of metastatic disease, and a number of statistical models have been developed to provide survival estimates for patients in this context. In this review, we discuss several well-validated survival prediction models for patients receiving palliative radiotherapy to sites outside of the brain. Key considerations include the type of statistical model, model performance measures and validation procedures, studies' source populations, time points used for prognostication, and details of model output. We then briefly discuss underutilization of these models, the role of decision support aids, and the need to incorporate patient preference in shared decision making for patients with metastatic disease who are candidates for palliative radiotherapy.",2023,Apr,Semin Radiat Oncol,33,2,104-113,,10.1016/j.semradonc.2023.01.003,36990628,#1347,Sun 2023,,,0
Challenges of Shared Decision-making by Clinicians and Patients With Low-risk Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Ethnography.,Yang W; Lee YK; Lorgelly P; Rogers SN; Kim D,"IMPORTANCE: Several international guidelines have endorsed more conservative treatment of low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (LRDTC), yet patients are facing more treatment options with similar oncologic outcomes and are expressing feelings of confusion, dissatisfaction, and anxiety. Shared decision-making, which considers the patient's values and preferences along with the most reliable medical evidence, has been proposed to optimize patient satisfaction in the context of the current clinical equipoise. OBJECTIVES: To understand key individual and behavioral factors affecting the patient and clinician decision-making process in treatment decision for LRDTC. EVIDENCE REVIEW: This systematic review and meta-ethnography involved a comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and CINAHL databases for qualitative and mixed-method studies on patient and clinician experiences with the decision-making process for LRDTC treatment. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool; meta-ethnography was used for data analysis. Primary and secondary themes of the included studies were extracted, compared, and translated across articles to produce a lines-of-argument synthesis. FINDINGS: Of 1081 publications identified, 12 articles met the inclusion criteria. The qualitative synthesis produced 4 themes: (1) a bimodal distribution of patient preferences for treatment decisions; (2) clinician anxiety affected equipoise and biased their recommendations; (3) clinicians struggled to identify patient concerns and preferences; and (4) the clinician-patient relationship and psychosocial support were key to shared decision-making but were frequently overlooked. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this systematic review and meta-ethnography emphasize the need for better patient-clinician communication, particularly with respect to eliciting patient concerns and preferences. With an ever-increasing pool of thyroid cancer survivors, future efforts should be directed at establishing and evaluating tools that will aid in shared decision-making for treatment of patients with LRDTC.

Rivaroxaban versus Apixaban for Treatment of Cancer-Associated Venous Thromboembolism in Patients at Lower Risk of Bleeding.,Caroti KS; Becattini C; Carrier M; Cohen AT; Ekbom A; Khorana AA; Lee AYY; Brescia C; Abdelgawwad K; Psaroudakis G; Rivera M; Schaefer B; Brobert G; Coleman CI,"This retrospective study, utilizing U.S. electronic health record (EHR) data from January 2013 to December 2020, sought to assess whether rivaroxaban and apixaban had similar effectiveness and safety in the treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with a cancer type not associated with a high risk of bleeding. We included adults diagnosed with active cancer, excluding esophageal, gastric, unresected colorectal, bladder, noncerebral central nervous system cancers and leukemia, who experienced VTE and received a therapeutic VTE dose of rivaroxaban or apixaban on day 7 post-VTE, and were active in the EHR ≥12 months prior to the VTE. Primary outcome was the composite of recurrent VTE or any bleed resulting in hospitalization at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included recurrent VTE, any bleed resulting in hospitalization, any critical organ bleed, and composites of these outcomes at 3 and 6 months. Inverse probability of treatment-weighted Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We included 1,344 apixaban and 1,093 rivaroxaban patients. At 3 months, rivaroxaban was found to have similar hazard to apixaban for developing recurrent VTE or any bleed resulting in hospitalization (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.60-1.27). No differences were observed between cohorts for this outcome at 6 months (HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.71-1.40) or for any other outcome at 3 or 6 months. In conclusion, patients receiving rivaroxaban or apixaban showed similar risks of the composite of recurrent VTE or any bleed resulting in hospitalization in patients with cancer-associated VTE. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT05461807.

Clinical decision-making in older patients with cancer: a cross-sectional single-centre study to assess the impact of clinical judgement and patient preferences.,Deldycke A; Denys H; Decruyenaere A; Velghe A; Naert E,"OBJECTIVE: The heterogeneity in the population of older patients with cancer makes clinical decision-making difficult. We investigated the agreement between the G8 score and clinical judgment in frailty assessments, determined the impact of a life-expectancy calculator, and explored patient and caregiver preferences towards the treatment goal. METHODS: Patients aged ≥75 years in need of new oncological treatment were prospectively enrolled between June 2020 and February 2021. Frailty was estimated by the oncologist and caregiver and compared to the G8 estimation. We examined whether the oncologist changed the fit/frail estimation based on life expectancy calculated using the ePrognosis tool. The main treatment goals, either longevity or quality of life (QoL), from the patient's and caregiver's perspective were noted and compared. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were included in the analysis. Comparison of the oncologist's and the caregiver's frailty estimation with the G8 assessment showed agreement and a Kappa coefficient of 58.3% (0.231) and 60% (0.255), respectively. The ePrognosis score and the odds of change in the frailty estimation by the oncologist showed no correlation. Regarding preferences, 28 (57.1%) and 17 (34.7%) patients and eighteen (47.3%) and seventeen (44.7%) caregivers chose longevity and QoL, respectively. The observed agreement and Kappa coefficient were 78.8% and 0.578. CONCLUSION: Compared to the G8 assessment, frailty was underestimated by both oncologists and caregivers. Most of the patients chose longevity over QoL, and the preferences between the patient and the caregiver matched in the majority of cases.",2023,Apr,Acta Clin Belg,78,2,103-111,,10.1080/17843286.2022.2074702,36879530,#1354,Deldycke 2023,,,0
What are the Most Important Objectives of Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy? A Narrative Review.,Virk A; Treacy PJ; Thanigasalam R; Leslie S,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate what objectives are most important to men undergoing radical prostatectomy to allow treating physicians to personalize perioperative counselling and improve patient quality of life outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A predefined search protocol of the Medline and Embase databases was performed from database inception to May 2023. The search was limited to English language and full text. All articles with a specific consideration of patient objectives, preferences or reasons for decision to undergo radical prostatectomy were included for review. RESULTS: Ten articles out of 375 screened met inclusion criteria for review. All 10 articles utilized a qualitative design and originated across 5 countries across the developed world. A common theme of men placing importance on having their tumor physically removed was found. Methodologies allowing free response beyond predefined categories identified a breadth of considerations including personal circumstance, personal belief and current function in the decision-making process. An investigation on radical prostatectomy performed robotically found some men placed preference on the quicker treatment time with surgery compared to radiation therapy, reflective of shorter recovery times with the robotic approach. CONCLUSION: Variability in results across studies highlights the heterogeneity in patient preferences. Directed investigation of patient objectives with an open-ended questioning approach would personalize the perioperative experience and may improve patient satisfaction and quality of life outcomes.",2023,,Res Rep Urol,15,,563-569,,10.2147/RRU.S444033,38145157,#556,Virk 2023,,,0
The influence of multidisciplinary team meetings on treatment decisions in advanced bladder cancer.,Walraven JEW; Ripping TM; Oddens JR; van Rhijn BWG; Goossens-Laan CA; Hulshof MCCM; Kiemeney LA; Witjes JA; Lemmens VEPP; van der Hoeven JJM; Desar IME; Aben KKH; Verhoeven RHA,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of specialised genitourinary multidisciplinary team meetings (MDTMs) in decision-making and identify factors that influence the probability of receiving a treatment plan with curative intent for patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data relating to patients with cT2-4aN0/X-1 M0 urothelial cell carcinoma, diagnosed between November 2017 and October 2019, were selected from the nationwide, population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry ('BlaZIB study'). Curative treatment options were defined as radical cystectomy (RC) with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy, chemoradiation or brachytherapy. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between MDTM factors and curative treatment advice and how this advice was followed. RESULTS: Of the 2321 patients, 2048 (88.2%) were discussed in a genitourinary MDTM. Advanced age (>80 years) and poorer World Health Organization performance status (score 1-2 vs 0) were associated with no discussion (P < 0.001). Being discussed was associated with undergoing treatment with curative intent (odds ratio [OR] 3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-4.9), as was the involvement of a RC hospital (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.09-2.65). Involvement of an academic centre was associated with higher rates of bladder-sparing treatment (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.31-3.21). Patient preference was the main reason for non-adherence to treatment advice. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with MIBC, the probability of being discussed in a MDTM was associated with age, performance status and receiving treatment with curative intent, especially if a representative of a RC hospital was present. Future studies should focus on the impact of MDTM advice on survival data.",2023,Feb,BJU Int,131,2,244-252,,10.1111/bju.15856,35861125,#1572,WalravenJEW 2023,,,0
Perspectives of the Friedreich ataxia community on gene therapy clinical trials.,Trantham SJ; Coker MA; Norman S; Crowley E; Berthy J; Byrne BJ; Subramony S; Lou X; Corti M,"Gene therapy is a potential treatment for Friedreich ataxia, with multiple programs on the horizon. The purpose of this study was to collect opinions about gene therapy from individuals 14 years or older with Friedreich ataxia or parents/caregivers of Friedreich ataxia patients who were diagnosed as children 17 or younger. Participants were asked to complete a survey after reading brief educational materials regarding gene therapy. Most of the patients captured in this survey have an early-onset (classical) presentation of the disease. Participants expressed urgency in participating in gene therapy clinical trials despite the associated risks. About half of the respondents believed that gene therapy would cease progression or minimize symptoms, whereas nearly one-fourth expected to be cured. The survey also revealed how participants perceive their symptom burden, because a substantial majority reported that balance/walking issues most interfere with their quality of life and would be the symptom they would prioritize treating. Although not statistically significant, more caregivers prioritized treating cardiomyopathy than patients. This study provides valuable information on priorities, beliefs, and expectations regarding gene therapy and serves to guide future gene therapy opinion studies and gene therapy trial design.",2024,Mar,Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,32,1,101179,,10.1016/j.omtm.2023.101179,38261944,#241,Trantham 2024,,,0
Comparing Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty and High Tibial Osteotomy for Isolated Medial Compartment Knee Osteoarthritis.,Goodell PB; Johansen PM; Bartels DW; Sherman SL; Amanatullah DF,"»: Both unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and high tibial osteotomy (HTO) allow for compartment-specific intervention on an arthritic knee joint that preserves bone stock and native soft tissue compared to a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Both operations give a more natural feeling with native proprioception compared with a TKA. »: HTO is better suited in patients who are younger (<55 years-of-age), have a body mass index (BMI) <30 kg/m2, high activity requirements, mechanical malalignment, asymmetric varus, isolated anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency, need for multiplanar correction, and a preference for joint preserving interventions. Recent data suggest that age (>55 years-of-age) should not solely contraindicate a HTO. »: UKA may be chosen in patients who are older (>55 years-of-age), low activity requirements, have a BMI <40 kg/m2, severe osteoarthritis with significant joint space narrowing, acceptable coronal alignment, symmetric varus, and patient preference for arthroplasty.",2023,Mar,JBJS Rev,11,3,,,e22.00127  10.2106/JBJS.RVW.22.00127,36930742,#1409,Goodell 2023,,,0

Patient attitudes and preferences about expanded noninvasive prenatal testing.,Dubois ML; Winters PD; Rodrigue MA; Gekas J,"Introduction: Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is typically carried out to screen for common fetal chromosomal anomalies, with the option to screen for a wider range of chromosomal changes (expanded NIPT) becoming increasingly available. However, little is known about pregnant patients' attitudes and preferences regarding expanded NIPT. Methods: To address this gap, we surveyed general-risk patients having first-tier cfDNA screening at a private prenatal clinic on their expectations for expanded NIPT. Patients were asked questions regarding their current pregnancy and previous pregnancy history, their opinions on fetal DNA screenings during pregnancy and incidental findings, information and opinions on financial resources for NIPT, as well as socio-cultural questions to determine patient demographics. Results: Of the 200 survey participants, the majority were educated, self-reported as white, had a higher than average income, and reported no aneuploidy risk factors. When asked what information they would like to receive from cfDNA screening, the vast majority of participants wanted all information available that could have an immediate impact on fetal health (88%) or an immediate impact on infant health from birth (82%). Many participants also wanted information that could have a future impact on the child's health or an immediate or future impact on the pregnant woman's own health. Most participants wanted information about the sex of fetus (86%) and common trisomies (71%), with almost half of participants desiring information about rare autosomal aneuploidies and/or all genetic information that may affect the baby. In addition, participants were found to be comfortable screening for conditions that are well-known, influence care during pregnancy, and are treatable. Finally, while most respondents either had insurance coverage for NIPT or were able to afford NIPT out of pocket, the majority of our participants felt that expanded NIPT should be either free for everyone or for those considered high risk. Discussion: Our findings suggest that with appropriate pre-test counseling, pregnant patients may choose NIPT for an expanding list of conditions.",2023,,Front Genet,14,,976051,,10.3389/fgene.2023.976051,37152999,#1322,Dubois 2023,,,0
Patient preferences for features of HER2-targeted treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer: a discrete-choice experiment study.,Mansfield C; Botha W; Vondeling GT; Klein K; Wang K; Singh J; Hackshaw MD,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to quantify patients' benefit-risk preferences for attributes associated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted breast cancer treatments and estimate minimum acceptable benefits (MABs), denominated in additional months of progression-free survival (PFS), for given treatment-related adverse events (AEs). METHODS: We conducted an online discrete-choice experiment (DCE) among patients with self-reported advanced/metastatic breast cancer in the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan (N = 302). In a series of nine DCE questions, respondents chose between two hypothetical treatment profiles created by an experimental design. Profiles were defined by six attributes with varying levels: PFS, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, liver function problems, risk of heart failure, and risk of serious lung damage and infections. Data were analyzed using an error component random-parameters logit model. RESULTS: Among the attributes, patients placed the most importance on a change in PFS from 5 to 26 months; change from no diarrhea to severe diarrhea was the least important. Avoiding a 15% risk of heart failure had the largest MAB (5.8 additional months of PFS), followed by avoiding a 15% risk of serious lung damage and infections (4.6 months), possible severe liver function problems (4.2 months), severe nausea/vomiting (3.7 months), and severe diarrhea (2.3 months) compared with having none of the AEs. The relative importance of 21 additional months of PFS (increasing from 5 to 26 months) increased for women with HER2-negative disease and those with children. CONCLUSIONS: Patients valued PFS gain higher than the potential risk of AEs when deciding between hypothetical breast cancer treatments.",2023,Jan,Breast Cancer,30,1,23-35,,10.1007/s12282-022-01394-6,36074320,#1660,Mansfield 2023,,,1
Patient Preferences in the Treatment of Moderate-to-severe Atopic Dermatitis.,Ameen M; Alhusayen R; Brandi H; Bøgelund M; Jensen HH; Reitzel SB; Thyssen JP,"Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease. A variety of systemic treatments are available for patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The efficacy, safety and administration profile of these treatments vary, and determining the optimal treatment strategy may require weighing the benefits and drawbacks of therapies with diverse characteristics. This study used an online discrete choice experiment survey to investigate treatment preferences among adults with atopic dermatitis from Denmark, France, the UK, or Canada. Participants were identified through existing online panels. The survey included questions regarding different treatment attributes, defined based on currently approved treatments for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Treatment preferences were measured as the relative importance of different treatment attributes. A total of 713 respondents met the inclusion criteria and completed the survey. The discrete choice experiment identified a significant preference for avoiding the risk of severe adverse events, and for oral pill every day compared with biweekly injections. The time to full effect was not rated as being important. These findings suggest that patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis prioritize safety as most important, followed by ease of administration in their treatment preferences, while time to full effect and monitoring requirements were the least important attributes.",2024,Feb,Acta Derm Venereol,104,,adv24339,,10.2340/actadv.v104.24339,38380974,#354,Ameen 2024,,,1
Interleukin-17A Inhibitors in Patients with Psoriasis and Tuberculosis Infection: A 2-Year Prospective Study on Safety Without Preventive Treatment.,He CX; Wu C; Zhang L; Jin HZ,"INTRODUCTION: The necessity for tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) and routine T-SPOT.TB monitoring in patients with psoriasis and tuberculosis infection (TBI) undergoing interleukin (IL)-17A inhibitor therapy remains uncertain. This study aims to evaluate the long-term safety of IL-17A inhibitors administered without TPT and analyze changes in T-SPOT.TB among these patients. It also identifies risk factors for TBI in patients with psoriasis. METHODS: This single-center prospective study enrolled adult patients with plaque psoriasis and TBI receiving IL-17A inhibitors. TBI was defined as positive T-SPOT.TB results (≥ 6 spots) without symptoms or evidence of active tuberculosis (ATB). TPT administration was based on contraindications, tuberculosis risk factors, and patient preferences. The primary endpoint was the incidence of ATB over 2 years. Secondary outcomes included T-SPOT.TB changes and TBI risk factors. RESULTS: Of the 129 patients with psoriasis and TBI enrolled in the study, 97 (75.2%) did not receive TPT, while 32 (24.8%) did. Among them, 109 patients (84.5%) completed the 2-year follow-up. During the 235 person-years of observation, no ATB cases were identified. Median T-SPOT.TB values showed no significant changes from baseline to year 2 in both the non-TPT (20 vs. 17 spots, p = 0.975) and TPT groups (55 vs. 58 spots, p = 0.830). T-SPOT.TB reversed in 14 patients (12.8%), mostly in the non-TPT group. Moreover, for TBI risk factor analysis, a cohort of 212 patients with psoriasis with negative baseline T-SPOT.TB was evaluated, revealing a TBI prevalence of 37.8%. Logistic regression analysis highlighted age ≥ 45 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.50-3.99, p < 0.001) and body mass index (BMI) < 24.0 kg/m(2) (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.27-3.54, p = 0.004) as independent risk factors for TBI. CONCLUSION: IL-17A inhibitors do not appear to reactivate tuberculosis in patients with psoriasis and TBI, potentially reducing the need for routine TBI screening and preventive treatment.

Shifting quality chronic pain treatment measures from processes to outcomes.,Coleman C; Lennon RP; Garza RH; Veasley C; Kuchera J; Edwards R; Zgierska AE,"OBJECTIVE: Misapplication of the 2016 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) opioid prescribing guidelines has led to overem-phasis of morphineequivalent daily dose (MEDD) as a ""metric of success"" in chronic noncancer pain (CNCP), resulting in unintentional harms to patients. This article reviews CNCP-related guidelines and patient preferences in order to identify pragmatic, patient-centered metrics to assess treatment response and safety in opioid-treated CNCP. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical (CDC), research (Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials), and implementability-related guidelines (GuideLine Implementability Appraisal), along with relevant patient-identified treatment goals. From these, we summarize a guideline-concordant, patient-centered, implementable set of measures to aid the clinical management of opioid-treated CNCP. RESULTS: We identify metrics across three domains of care: (1) treatment response metrics, which align with the CNCP care goals (pain intensity, pain interference including function and quality of life, and global impression of change); (2) risk assessment (""safety"") metrics, eg, MEDD, benzodiazepine-opioid or naloxone-opioid coprescribing, and severity of mental health disorders, which evaluate the risk-benefit profile of opioid therapy; and (3) adherence (""process"") metrics, which assess clinician/patient adherence to the guideline-recommended opioid therapy monitoring practices, eg, the presence of completed treatment agreement or urine toxicology testing. All metrics should be informed by implementability principles, eg, be decidable, executable, and measurable. CONCLUSIONS: This article summarizes guideline-concordant, patient-centered, implementable metrics for assessing treatment response, safety, and adherence in opioid-treated CNCP. Regardless of which specific treatment guidelines are applied, this approach could help conceptualize and standardize the collection and reporting of CNCP-relevant metrics, compare them across health systems, and optimize care and treatment outcomes in opioid-treated CNCP.",2023,Special-Issue,J Opioid Manag,19,7,83-94,,10.5055/jom.2023.0802,37879663,#1610,Coleman 2023,,,0
Evaluating the Efficiency of Survey Collection Methods to Trauma Patients.,Moran V; Oberle A; Israel H,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic injury survivors often experience negative health consequences, impacting recovery. No studies have assessed the feasibility of evaluating the resiliency of hospitalized trauma patients using the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10). PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the most efficient method to collect survey responses on the CD-RISC-10. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a convenience sample of admitted patients with traumatic injury. Patients were randomized to complete the CD-RISC-10 using pen and paper, tablet, or workstation on wheels. RESULTS: Of the 161 patient surveys, the tablet-based survey took the shortest time to complete (2 minutes, 21 seconds), and the paper survey resulted in the lowest percentage of missed questions (0.5%). Trauma patients reported high levels of resiliency. CONCLUSION: The CD-RISC-10 can be easily administered to trauma patients.

Gene therapy preferences and informed decision-making: Results from a National Hemophilia Foundation Community Voices in research survey.,Limjoco J; Calatroni A; Aristizabal P; Thornburg CD,"INTRODUCTION: To inform education and treatment discussions, it is important to understand how persons with haemophilia prefer to learn about and discuss new therapies and to identify variables that influence decision-making. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate preferences and variables which influence decision-making related to gene therapy and other novel haemophilia therapies. METHODS: An online survey was sent to men with severe haemophilia enrolled in the National Hemophilia Foundation Community Voices in Research online platform for patient-powered research. RESULTS: One hundred four men completed the survey including 33% Hispanics, 96 who had had not gene therapy and 71/96 (74%) who were on prophylaxis. Ninety-five percent were somewhat or very familiar with gene therapy. Men with haemophilia obtain information about new therapies from several sources, most commonly their haemophilia treatment team, patient advocacy groups and self-study. Participants identified safety and efficacy as well as other educational needs to inform decision-making. Of those without prior gene therapy, 73% indicated a high likelihood of considering gene therapy. Hispanic ethnicity and government-issued insurance were associated with a higher likelihood of considering gene therapy as a treatment option. CONCLUSION: Haemophilia Treatment Centers and patient advocacy groups must be able to educate persons with haemophilia about aspects of novel therapies which are important to the individual, especially short- and long-term safety and efficacy. Further research is needed to determine how patient activation and health literacy influence decision-making and how to achieve equitable access and valid informed consent for novel therapies.",2023,Jan,Haemophilia,29,1,51-60,,10.1111/hae.14706,36469856,#1637,Limjoco 2023,,,0
Visual performance and patient preference with bilateral implantation of an extended depth of focus or combined implantation of an extended depth of focus/trifocal intraocular lens.,Moore J; Østergaard J; Kretz F,"PURPOSE: Evaluate postoperative visual performance in patients with bilaterally implanted AT LARA or AT LARA/AT LISA tri (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany) intraocular lenses. METHODS: Multicentered, comparative, open-label, retrospective/prospective study. Post-IOL implantation, patients were prospectively enrolled into this study; preoperative patient data were collected retrospectively. Follow-up was at 2-4 and 5-8 months post-surgery. The primary endpoint was binocular best corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA). The study was retrospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT05462067). RESULTS: Seventy-one patients (142 eyes) were enrolled; 67 patients (134 eyes) have 5-8 months data. The mean binocular CDVA at 2-4 months was -0.10 ± 0.06 logMAR in the bilateral AT LARA group (""bilateral"") and -0.11 ± 0.09 logMAR in the combined implantation AT LARA/ AT LISA tri group (""combined implantation""); (P = 0.4856). At 5-8 months, mean binocular CDVA was -0.13 ± 0.06 logMAR in the bilateral group and -0.11 ± 0.09 in the combined implantation group (P = 0.4003). At 5-8 months, more eyes in the bilateral group attained 0.2 logMAR or better binocular uncorrected intermediate VA (UIVA; 67 cm) than those in the combined implantation group (100% vs. 94%, respectively). The bilateral group achieved a mean of 0.24 ± 0.11 logMAR in uncorrected near VA (UCNVA), compared to a mean of 0.16 ± 0.12 logMAR in the combined implantation group at 5-8 months (P = 0.0041). CONCLUSIONS: A combined implantation approach (AT LARA in the distance dominant eye/AT LISA tri in the non-dominant eye) produced similar CDVA outcomes but better UCNVA as bilateral implantation with the AT LARA.

"An Online Decision Aid for Patients With Metastatic Melanoma—Results of the Randomized Controlled Trial ""PEF-Immun"".",Grabbe P; Borchers MS; Gschwendtner KM; Strobel S; Wild B; Kirchner M; Kälber K; Rendon A; Steininger J; Meier F; Hassel JC; Bieber C,"BACKGROUND: Treatment decisions in metastatic melanoma (MM) depend on patient preferences and require the patients' involvement in the decision-making process. Patients often feel overwhelmed by the complexity of treatment options with their individual advantages and disadvantages. We developed an online patient decision aid (PtDA) to facilitate shared decision making (SDM). METHODS: We conducted a two-center, two-armed, prospective, open randomized controlled trial with MM patients who were facing a decision about first-line treatment. They were randomly allotted (1:1) to the use or non-use of the PtDA before discussing the choice of treatment with a physician (intervention group [IG] and control group [CG], respectively). The primary endpoint of the study was patient knowledge about first-line treatment options (multiple-choice test, 10 items, range 0-40 points). The secondary endpoints were the degree of SDM (ratings of audio recordings of the patient-physician discussions by third-party observers) and satisfaction with the decision that was taken on later follow-up. RESULTS: 120 of the 128 randomized patients completed the baseline questionnaire and were included in the analysis (59% male, median age 66 years). The primary endpoint, i.e., the mean difference in knowledge after discussion with a physician, was significantly higher in the intervention group (mean difference -3.22, 95% CI [-6.32;-0.12], p = 0.042). No difference was found in either of the secondary endpoints (SDM and satisfaction with the decision). The patients in the intervention group rated the PtDA as very useful. CONCLUSION: PtDA improved MM patients' knowledge about their options for treatment. Both patients who used it and patients who did not were highly satisfied with their treatment decisions. Additional physician training seems necessary to promote SDM.",2024,Jun,Dtsch Arztebl Int,,Forthcoming,,,10.3238/arztebl.m2024.053,38566437,#163,Grabbe 2024,,,0
Understanding Treatment Preferences for Patients with Tricuspid Regurgitation.,Iyer V; Faza NN; Pfeiffer M; Kozak M; Peterson B; Wyler von Ballmoos M; Mollenkopf S; Mancilla M; Latibeaudiere-Gardner D; Reardon MJ,"Background. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a high-prevalence disease associated with poor quality of life and mortality. This quantitative patient preference study aims to identify TR patients' perspectives on risk-benefit tradeoffs. Methods. A discrete-choice experiment was developed to explore TR treatment risk-benefit tradeoffs. Attributes (levels) tested were treatment (procedure, medical management), reintervention risk (0%, 1%, 5%, 10%), medications over 2 y (none, reduce, same, increase), shortness of breath (none/mild, moderate, severe), and swelling (never, 3× per week, daily). A mixed logit regression model estimated preferences and calculated predicted probabilities. Relative attribute importance was calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed. Results. An online survey was completed by 150 TR patients. Shortness of breath was the most important attribute and accounted for 65.8% of treatment decision making. The average patients' predicted probability of preferring a ""procedure-like"" profile over a ""medical management-like"" profile was 99.7%. This decreased to 78.9% for a level change from severe to moderate in shortness of breath in the ""medical management-like"" profile. Subgroup analysis confirmed that patients older than 64 y had a stronger preference to avoid severe shortness of breath compared with younger patients (P < 0.02), as did severe or worse TR patients relative to moderate. New York Heart Association class I/II patients more strongly preferred to avoid procedural reintervention risk relative to class III/IV patients (P < 0.03). Conclusion. TR patients are willing to accept higher procedural reintervention risk if shortness of breath is alleviated. This risk tolerance is higher for older and more symptomatic patients. These results emphasize the appropriateness of developing TR therapies and the importance of addressing symptom burden. HIGHLIGHTS: This study provides quantitative patient preference data from clinically confirmed tricuspid regurgitation (TR) patients to understand their treatment preferences.Using a targeted literature search and patient, physician, and Food and Drug Administration feedback, a cross-sectional survey with a discrete-choice experiment that focused on 5 of the most important attributes to TR patients was developed and administered online.TR patients are willing to accept higher procedural reintervention risk if shortness of breath is alleviated, and this risk tolerance is higher for older and more symptomatic patients.",2024,Jan-Jun,MDM Policy Pract,9,1,23814683231225667,,10.1177/23814683231225667,38250668,#465,Iyer 2024,,,1
Evaluation of post-operative surveillance strategies and surgeon perceptions and beliefs of surveillance for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in the UK.,McKay SC; Pathak S; Roberts KJ,"BACKGROUND: Despite high rates of recurrence after surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) there is lack of standardised surveillance practices. We aimed to identify UK surveillance practice and interrogate surgeon beliefs around surveillance. METHODS: A web-based survey was sent to all UK pancreatic units to assess surveillance practice for resected PDAC, factors influencing surveillance protocols, and perceptions and beliefs surrounding on current postoperative surveillance. RESULTS: There was wide variation in reported practice between 40 consultant surgeons from 28 pancreatic units (100% unit response rate). 26% had standardised surveillance compared to 18% with no standardised practice. 16% individualised surveillance to the patient, and 40% reported differing practices between surgeons within units despite local surveillance protocols. 66% felt surveillance should be tailored to patient factors, and 58% to patient preference. There was a broad belief regarding a lack of robust evidence supporting surveillance making a trial necessary. Thematic analysis identified surveillance barriers, considerations for trial design, necessity for patient engagement and potential benefits of surveillance. DISCUSSION: Wide variation in surveillance practice exists within and between units. A surveillance trial was deemed beneficial, however identified barriers potentially preclude a trial.

Co-Design of an Evidence-Based Practice Continuing Education Course for Canadian Naturopathic Doctors.,Aucoin M; Newton G; Leach M; Cooley K,"Objectives: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is a clinical decision-making process combining the best available scientific evidence with clinician expertise and patient preference. While EBP has been associated with a range of benefits, it is recognized that EBP is used suboptimally by a range of health professionals, including naturopathic doctors (NDs). Canadian NDs have expressed a high level of interest in opportunities to improve their EBP skills; however, barriers exist, including those that apply broadly to health professionals, and those that are unique to the naturopathic profession. The objective of the present project was to co-design an EBP continuing education (CE) course tailored to the needs and preferences of Canadian NDs. Design: These needs were solicited through the use of focus groups. Groups were stratified based on participants' use of evidence at baseline. The focus groups asked NDs about their definition of EBP, and their interest in an EBP course, including preferred content, and method of delivery. The focus group discussions were transcribed, and thematic analysis was completed. Subjects: Twenty-two Canadian NDs participated. Results: Participants reported a high level of understanding of EBP, a high level of interest in participating in an EBP course and provided actionable recommendations about course content and delivery. Some of the themes that emerged were consistent across the groups while others differed by stratification.

Surgeon preference for treatment allocation in older people facing major gastrointestinal surgery: an application of the discrete choice experiment methodology.,Daniels SL; Morgan J; Lee MJ; Wickramasekera N; Moug S; Wilson TR; Brown SR; Wyld L,"AIM: Variation in major gastrointestinal surgery rates in the older population suggests heterogeneity in surgical management. A higher prevalence of comorbidities, frailty and cognitive impairments in the older population may account for some variation. The aim of this study was to determine surgeon preference for major surgery versus conservative management in hypothetical patient scenarios based on key attributes. METHOD: A survey was designed according to the discrete choice methodology guided by a separate qualitative study. Questions were designed to test for associations between key attributes (age, comorbidity, urgency of presentation, pathology, functional and cognitive status) and treatment preference for major gastrointestinal surgery versus conservative management. The survey consisting of 18 hypothetical scenarios was disseminated electronically to UK gastrointestinal surgeons. Binomial logistic regression was used to identify associations between the attributes and treatment preference. RESULTS: In total, 103 responses were received after 256 visits to the questionnaire site (response rate 40.2%). Participants answered 1847 out of the 1854 scenarios (99.6%). There was a preference for major surgery in 1112/1847 (60.2%) of all scenarios. Severe comorbidities (OR 0.001, 95% CI 0.000-0.030; P = 0.000), severe cognitive impairment (OR 0.001, 95% CI 0.000-0.033; P = 0.000) and age 85 years and above (OR 0.028, 95% CI 0.005-0.168; P = 0.000) were all significant in the decision not to offer major gastrointestinal surgery.

Abdominal Hysterectomy.,Carugno J; Fatehi M,"Abdominal hysterectomy was first performed in 1843. Prior attempts at removal of the uterus date back to ancient times, when vaginal hysterectomy was performed to treat uterine prolapse or inversion. Laparoscopic assistance was used to facilitate minimally invasive hysterectomy in 1989 and further advanced in 2005 with the approval of the robotic-assisted technique. Today, abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and a combination of vaginal and laparoscopic techniques are utilized for hysterectomy. The surgical approach to hysterectomy depends on the clinical indication, the technical experience of the surgeon, the resources available, the general health condition of the patient, and patient preference. An abdominal hysterectomy involves the removal of the uterus through an incision in the abdominal wall. As minimally invasive techniques have become more available, the rates of abdominal hysterectomy have declined since the less invasive approaches offer benefits such as less post-operative pain, expedited recovery times, and better short-term quality of life after surgery, as well as shorter hospitalization stays and reduced costs. Furthermore, the use of hysterectomy, in general, has decreased as alternatives to hysterectomy continue to gain favor, such as endometrial ablation for symptomatic uterine bleeding and uterine artery embolization for uterine leiomyomas. Still, hysterectomy remains the most appropriate management option for many patients. Large uterine size has been cited as a common reason for choosing the abdominal approach to hysterectomy, as it has been thought that an enlarged uterus may require better visualization and exposure due to higher risks of blood loss, injury to neighboring viscera, and prolonged operating times. However, there are no specific recommendations up to which uterine weight or size should qualify a patient for abdominal hysterectomy, and studies have shown that minimally invasive techniques, such as laparoscopy, can safely remove larger uteri. Despite these findings, abdominal hysterectomy remains a common route of surgery being most commonly indicated for uterine fibroids, followed by abnormal uterine bleeding, prolapse, and endometriosis.",2024,Jan,,,,,,,33232036,#541,Carugno 2024,,,0
In-office needle arthroscopy is a cost-effective alternative for operating room diversion in medial meniscectomy: a financial analysis.,Abbas A; Shah A; Lex JR; Abouali J; Toor J,"BACKGROUND: In-office needle arthroscopy (IONA) has been described as a diagnostic alternative to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for intra-articular pathology. However, few studies have analyzed its impact on cost and wait times when used as a therapeutic intervention. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact on cost and wait times associated with offering IONA for partial medial meniscectomy as an alternative to traditional operating room (OR) arthroscopy for patients with irreparable medial meniscus tears on MRI. METHODS: Two models were created comparing the existing care pathway (current state) to a proposed future state utilizing IONA. Data sources were accounting data from an academically affiliated hospital in Canada and supplemented with literature values. A Monte Carlo simulation combined with DuPont analysis running 10,000 simulations was conducted to calculate the revenue, expenses, profits, and effect on surgical waitlists (i.e., throughput) between the states. Sensitivity analyses examined the influence of patient preference and revision rates on profit and throughput. Two-sample Student's t test was performed (p < .05). RESULTS: An average of 198 (standard deviation (SD) 31) patients underwent arthroscopic meniscectomy or repair each year from 2016 to 2020. The IONA revision rate was calculated as 20.3%. Compared to the current state, annual expenses in the IONA pathway were significantly reduced ($266,912.68 versus $281,415.23, p < .0001), while improving throughput by 21.2% (3.54%). Sensitivity analysis revealed 10% of patients need to select IONA over traditional OR arthroscopy with the revision rate remaining below 40% for the proposed state profit to be higher than the current state. CONCLUSIONS: IONA is a cost-effective alternative to traditional OR arthroscopy in patients undergoing partial medial meniscectomy. The next steps are to assess patients' perceptions of IONA as an alternative to traditional OR arthroscopy, and to carry out clinical trials to determine the efficacy, patient-reported outcome metrics, and complications of IONA.",2023,Jun,J Orthop Surg Res,18,1,435,,10.1186/s13018-023-03866-7,37322494,#1161,Abbas 2023,,,0
Patient-related outcomes and Oral Health-Related Quality of Life in endodontics.,Doğramacı EJ; Rossi-Fedele G,"There is increased interest in outcome measures that complement the classic goal of endodontics, being the prevention and healing of apical periodontitis. Possible outcome measures can be subdivided into patient-centred outcomes (PCOs), encompassing data collected by nonpatients aiming to assess the effectiveness of an intervention and patient-reported outcomes (PROs), which are reported directly by the patient. PROs can be subsequently classed into PRO measures that ascertain patients' view of their symptoms, their functional status, and their health-related quality of life, and patient-reported experience measures that focus on aspects including the humanity of care, patient satisfaction, patient preference and adherence, personal costs, expectation fulfilment, and decision regrets. The present review aims to define various patient-related outcomes and discuss the literature available regarding PCOs and PROs in endodontics. This includes those proposed to assess the effectiveness of endodontic treatment for pulpitis and apical periodontitis for use in the development of European Society of Endodontology S3-level clinical practice guidelines that have been included by all working groups, except for the radiographic assessment of apical periodontitis. Based on limited evidence in the field, it can be summarized that after recall periods of various lengths, endodontic treatment is associated with a high likelihood of tooth survival and limited need for further intervention, including extraction and further restorative procedures. Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) is likely to improve following the completion of treatment. Nonetheless, the literature assessing the association between OHRQoL and endodontics is hampered by the use of instruments that have not been previously validated. Amongst the remaining outcome measures discussed in the present review, it is worth highlighting that there is only one study assessing exacerbations in teeth with the presence of endodontic pathosis, which suggests a very low incidence of this adverse effect following endodontic treatment. Patients' expectation fulfilment, adherence, and satisfaction are closely inter-related and depend also on various nonclinical factors. Further studies assessing PCOs and PROs, in association with healing and prevention of apical periodontitis, are required to better understand endodontic treatment from the perspective of patients.",2023,Mar,Int Endod J,56 Suppl 2,,169-187,,10.1111/iej.13830,36102371,#1492,Doğramacı 2023,,,0
Achalasia: Current therapeutic options.,Rolland S; Paterson W; Bechara R,"Achalasia is an esophageal motor disorder characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and absent peristalsis in the smooth muscle esophageal body. As a result, patients typically experience dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss. Over the past 10-15 years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the evaluation of therapies for achalasia. Unfortunately, little progress in the development of effective pharmacological treatments has been made. Botulinum toxin injection provides some relief of symptoms in many patients but requires periodic reinjection that may provide progressively less benefit over time. There are now three well-established, safe, and effective therapies for the treatment of achalasia: pneumatic dilation (PD), laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM), and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) which can lead to marked symptom improvement in most patients. Each treatment has a specific constellation of risks, benefits, and recurrence rate. The first-line treatment used will depend on patient preference, achalasia subtype, and local expertise. The recent impressive advances in both the art and science of achalasia therapy are explored with a comprehensive review of the various treatment modalities and comparative controlled clinical trials. In addition, key technical pearls of the procedural treatments are demonstrated.",2023,Jan,Neurogastroenterol Motil,35,1,e14459,,10.1111/nmo.14459,36153803,#1654,Rolland 2023,,,0
Patient perceptions of in-hospital laboratory blood testing: A patient-oriented and patient co-designed qualitative study.,Pokharel S; Khawaja Z; Williams J; Mithwani AA; Strain K; Khanna P; Rychtera A; Kiryanova V; Tang K; Mathura P; Hylton C; Ambasta A,"BACKGROUND: Indiscriminate use of laboratory blood testing in hospitals contributes to patient discomfort and healthcare waste. Patient engagement in low-value healthcare can help reduce overuse. Understanding patient experience is necessary to identify opportunities to improve patient engagement with in-hospital laboratory testing. OBJECTIVES: To understand patient experience with the process of in-hospital laboratory blood testing. METHODS: We used a qualitative study design via semistructured interviews conducted online or over the phone. Participants were adult patients or family members/caregivers (≥18 years of age) with a recent (within 12 months of interview) experience of hospitalization in Alberta or British Columbia, Canada. We identified participants through convenience sampling and conducted interviews between May 2021 and June 2022. We analysed transcripts using thematic content analysis. Recruitment was continued until code saturation was reached. RESULTS: We interviewed 16 participants (13 patients, 1 family member and 2 caregivers). We identified four themes from patients' experiences of in-hospital laboratory blood testing: (i) patients need information from healthcare teams about expected blood testing processes, (ii) blood draw processes should consider patient comfort and preferences, (iii) patients want information from their healthcare teams about the rationale and frequency of blood testing and (iv) patients need information on how their testing results affect their medical care. CONCLUSION: Current laboratory testing processes in hospitals do not facilitate shared decision-making and patient engagement. Patient engagement with laboratory testing in hospitals requires an empathetic healthcare team that provides clear communication regarding testing procedures, rationale and results, while considering patient preferences and offering opportunities for involvement. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: We interviewed 16 patients and/or family members/caregivers regarding their in-hospital laboratory blood testing experiences. Our findings show correlations between patient needs and patient recommendations to make testing processes more patient-centred. To bring a lived-experience lens to this study, we formed a Patient Advisory Council with 9-11 patient research partners. Our patient research partners informed the research design, co-developed participant recruitment strategies, co-conducted data collection and informed the data analysis. Some of our patient research partners are co-authors of this manuscript.",2023,Sep,Health Expect,27,1,,,10.1111/hex.13880,37751312,#858,Pokharel 2023,,,0
Comparing Discrete Choice Experiment with Swing Weighting to Estimate Attribute Relative Importance: A Case Study in Lung Cancer Patient Preferences.,Veldwijk J; Smith IP; Oliveri S; Petrocchi S; Smith MY; Lanzoni L; Janssens R; Huys I; de Wit GA; Groothuis-Oudshoorn CGM,"INTRODUCTION: Discrete choice experiments (DCE) are commonly used to elicit patient preferences and to determine the relative importance of attributes but can be complex and costly to administer. Simpler methods that measure relative importance exist, such as swing weighting with direct rating (SW-DR), but there is little empirical evidence comparing the two. This study aimed to directly compare attribute relative importance rankings and weights elicited using a DCE and SW-DR. METHODS: A total of 307 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer in Italy and Belgium completed an online survey assessing preferences for cancer treatment using DCE and SW-DR. The relative importance of the attributes was determined using a random parameter logit model for the DCE and rank order centroid method (ROC) for SW-DR. Differences in relative importance ranking and weights between the methods were assessed using Cohen's weighted kappa and Dirichlet regression. Feedback on ease of understanding and answering the 2 tasks was also collected. RESULTS: Most respondents (>65%) found both tasks (very) easy to understand and answer. The same attribute, survival, was ranked most important irrespective of the methods applied. The overall ranking of the attributes on an aggregate level differed significantly between DCE and SW-ROC (P < 0.01). Greater differences in attribute weights between attributes were reported in DCE compared with SW-DR (P < 0.01). Agreement between the individual-level attribute ranking across methods was moderate (weighted Kappa 0.53-0.55). CONCLUSION: Significant differences in attribute importance between DCE and SW-DR were found. Respondents reported both methods being relatively easy to understand and answer. Further studies confirming these findings are warranted. Such studies will help to provide accurate guidance for methods selection when studying relative attribute importance across a wide array of preference-relevant decisions. HIGHLIGHTS: Both DCEs and SW tasks can be used to determine attribute relative importance rankings and weights; however, little evidence exists empirically comparing these methods in terms of outcomes or respondent usability.Most respondents found the DCE and SW tasks very easy or easy to understand and answer.A direct comparison of DCE and SW found significant differences in attribute importance rankings and weights as well as a greater spread in the DCE-derived attribute relative importance weights.",2024,Feb,Med Decis Making,44,2,203-216,,10.1177/0272989X231222421,38178591,#415,Veldwijk 2024,,,1
Turning It Over to God: African American Assisted Living Residents' End-of-Life Preferences and Advance Care Planning.,Kemp CL; Skipper AD; Bender AA; Perkins MM,"OBJECTIVES: Assisted living (AL), a popular long-term care setting for older Americans, increasingly is a site for end-of-life care. Although most residents prefer AL to be their final home, relatively little is known about end-of-life preferences and advance care planning, especially among African American residents. Our research addresses this knowledge gap. METHODS: Informed by grounded theory, we present an analysis of qualitative data collected over 2 years in a 100-bed AL community catering to African American residents. Data consisted of field notes from participant observation conducted during 310 site visits and 818 observation hours, in-depth interviews with 25 residents, and a review of their AL records. RESULTS: Residents varied in their end-of-life preferences and advance care planning, but united in the belief that God was in control. We identified ""Turning it over to God"" as an explanatory framework for understanding how this group negotiated end-of-life preferences and advance care planning. Individual-level resident factors (e.g., age, pain, and function) and factors reflecting broader cultural and societal influences, including health literacy and care experiences, were influential. DISCUSSION: Contradictions arose from turning it over to God, including those between care preferences, planning, and anticipated or actual end-of-life outcomes.",2023,Oct,J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci,78,10,1747-1755,,10.1093/geronb/gbad100,37466307,#786,Kemp 2023,,,0
Efficacy of Telehealth for Movement-Evoked Pain in People With Chronic Achilles Tendinopathy: A Noninferiority Analysis.,Post AA; Rio EK; Sluka KA; Moseley GL; Bayman EO; Hall MM; de Cesar Netto C; Wilken JM; Danielson J; Chimenti RL,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of physical therapy delivered via an all telehealth or hybrid format with an all in-person format on movement-evoked pain for individuals with chronic Achilles tendinopathy (AT). METHODS: Sixty-six individuals with chronic AT participated (age, 43.4 [SD = 15.4] years; 56% female; body mass index, 29.9 [SD = 7.7] kg/m2). Participants completed all in-person visits from the initiation of recruitment in September 2019 to March 16, 2020 (in-person group). From March 17 to July 15, 2020, participants completed all telehealth visits (telehealth group). From July 16, 2020, to enrollment completion in December 2020, participants could complete visits all in-person, all telehealth, or a combination of in-person and telehealth (hybrid group) based on their preference. A physical therapist provided 6 to 7 visits, including an exercise program and patient education. Noninferiority analyses of the telehealth and hybrid groups compared with the in-person group were completed for the primary outcome of movement-evoked pain during single-limb heel raises. RESULTS: All groups demonstrated decreases in movement-evoked pain beyond the minimal clinically important difference from baseline to 8 weeks (2 out of 10 on a numeric pain rating scale). Lower bounds of the 95% CIs for mean differences between groups did not surpass the preestablished noninferiority margin (2 out of 10) for movement-evoked pain in both the telehealth and hybrid groups (telehealth vs in-person: 0.45 [-1.1 to 2.0]; hybrid vs in-person: 0.48 [-1.0 to 1.9]). CONCLUSION: Individuals with chronic AT who completed a tendon-loading program with patient education through a telehealth or hybrid format had no worse outcomes for pain than those who received the same intervention through in-person visits. IMPACT: Physical therapist-directed patient care delivered via telehealth may enhance accessibility to best practice AT rehabilitation, including exercise and education. Use of telehealth technology may also provide an opportunity to prioritize patient preference for physical therapy visit format. LAY SUMMARY: If you are a patient with chronic AT, physical therapist-directed patient care delivered via telehealth may improve your accessibility to best practice AT rehabilitation, including exercise and education. Use of telehealth technology may also prioritize your preferences regarding the format of the physical therapy visit.",2023,Mar,Phys Ther,103,3,,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT04059146,10.1093/ptj/pzac171,37172125,#1421,Post 2023,,,0
Patient Preferences for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treatments: A Discrete-Choice Experiment.,Li D; Tan R; Hernandez S; Reilly N; Bussberg C; Mansfield C,"Treatments for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have varying benefit-risk profiles. We elicited 200 US patients' preferences for attributes associated with various first-line systemic treatments for unresectable HCC in a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey. Respondents answered nine DCE questions, each offering a choice between two hypothetical treatment profiles defined by six attributes with varying levels: overall survival (OS), months of maintained daily function, severity of palmar-plantar syndrome, severity of hypertension, risk of digestive-tract bleeding, and mode and frequency of administration. A random-parameters logit model was used to analyze the preference data. Patients regarded an additional 10 months of maintaining daily function without decline to be as important or more important than 10 additional months of OS, on average. Respondents valued avoiding moderate-to-severe palmar-plantar syndrome and hypertension more than extended OS. A respondent would require >10 additional months of OS (the greatest increase presented in the study) on average to offset the increased burden of adverse events. Patients with unresectable HCC prioritize avoiding adverse events that would severely impact their quality of life over mode and frequency of administration or digestive-tract bleeding risk. For some patients with unresectable HCC, maintaining daily functioning is as important or more important than the survival benefit of a treatment.",2023,Feb,Cancers (Basel),15,5,,,10.3390/cancers15051470,36900262,#1503,Li 2023,,,1
Delivering Prognostic News to Older People with Chronic Disease: What Format Preference and Level of Involvement in Decision Making? A Hospital Survey.,Lewis ET; Hammill K; Culbert R; van der Merwe M; Sahay A; Turner R; Cardona M,"Shared decision making near end of life is a balancing act of communicating prognosis to patients and their surrogates/families and engaging them in considering value-concordant management choices. This cross-sectional survey aimed to determine the format in which older patients with chronic illnesses would prefer to receive prognostic information on their treatment options and disease progression, and their desired level of engagement in decision making. With a 60% participation rate, 139 inpatients in two hospitals and five surrogates were presented with six hypothetical scenarios with a randomly assigned sequence: verbal and written summary, graph, table, photo, video, and pamphlet. The majority (76%) of respondents chose the traditional verbal communication of prognosis by their doctor with a written summary as a reference and to share with family; the second choice was a condition-specific pamphlet (63%). Many found the graph and photo to be distressing (36% and 42%, respectively). Most (71%) wanted to know everything about their condition trajectory, and 63% chose shared decision making rather than completely autonomous or full delegation to clinicians or family. There were no gender differentials between wanting to know it all, supporting shared decision making or the preferred format for breaking news (p > 0.05). Older hospitalized patients with chronic conditions are willing to discuss end-of-life issues, learn about their prognosis, and be involved in shared decision making. Innovative formats such as graphs, videos, or photos were not welcome as part of the prognostic discussion.",2023,Feb,Healthcare (Basel),11,3,,,10.3390/healthcare11030444,36767019,#1525,Lewis 2023,,,0

Interprofessional education for shared decision making in drug therapy: a scoping review.,Barbosa Detoni K; Lopes André A; Rezende CP; Furtado BT; de Araújo Medina Mendonça S; Ramalho-de-Oliveira D,"The current complex scenario of medication use calls for the implementation of interprofessional education (IPE) initiatives focused on shared decision making (SDM) in drug therapy. A scoping review was conducted to collate, summarize, and report the evidence available on IPE teaching and learning approaches in this context, involving pre-licensure healthcare students. Searches were conducted in seven electronic databases, with 21 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. This review examines educational strategies employed for interprofessional SDM as well as characteristics of students, teachers, and tutors involved in IPE interventions. The reviewed studies lack detailed description of the students' decision-making process, and none addresses aspects related to patient preferences as a part of learning outcomes. We identified shortcomings in how IPE interventions are assessed and reported. Only a few of the studies explicitly describe the use of competency-based frameworks proposed by national and international organizations, and less than 60% describe learning outcomes. The absence of experiences focused on interprofessional SDM in drug therapy suggests a gap that needs to be addressed with future studies evaluated in a robust way. We argue that such experiences enable students, as a team, to learn to share decisions with the patient as an effective team member.",2023,May-Jun,J Interprof Care,37,3,491-503,,10.1080/13561820.2022.2039598,35285394,#1304,BarbosaDetoni 2023,,,0
Colorectal Cancer Screening in the Elderly: Does Increased Prevalence Necessitate Tighter Surveillance.,Suki M; Abu-Baker F; Beshara A; Ovadia B; Gal O; Kopelman Y,"BACKGROUND: With age, colorectal cancer (CRC) prevalence rises. The elderly (> 75 years), and the very elderly (> 85 years) are especially vulnerable. The advantages of screening must be assessed in the context of diminished life span and co-morbidities. OBJECTIVES: To compare CRC findings in colonoscopies that were performed following a positive fecal occult blood test/fecal immunochemical test (FOBT/FIT) in both elderly and very elderly age groups with those of younger patients. METHODS: We identified colonoscopies conducted between 1998 and 2019 following a positive stool test for occult blood in asymptomatic individuals. A finding of malignancy was compared between the two patient age groups. Furthermore, a sub-analysis was performed for positive malignancy findings in FOBT/FIT among patients > 85 years compared to younger than < 75 years. RESULTS: We compared the colonoscopy findings in 10,472 patients: 40-75 years old (n=10,146) vs. 76-110 years old (n=326). There was no significant difference in prevalence of CRC detection rate between the groups following positive FOBT/FIT (2.1% vs. 2.7%, P = 0.47). Similar results for non-significant differences were obtained in the sub-analysis compared to malignancy detection rates in the very elderly 0% (n=0) vs. 2.1% for < 75 years old (n=18), P = 0.59. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of CRC increases with age, no significant increase in the detection rate of CRC by FOBT was found in either the elderly or very elderly age groups.

"Impact of Race, Ethnicity, Primary Language, and Insurance on Reconstruction after Mastectomy for Patients with Breast Cancer at an Urban, Academic Safety-Net Hospital.",Beaulieu-Jones BR; Fefferman A; Woods AP; Shewmaker G; Zhang T; Roh DS; Sachs TE; Merrill A; Ko NY; Cassidy MR,"BACKGROUND: Disparities in breast reconstruction have been observed in national cohorts and single-institution studies based on race, ethnicity, insurance, and language. However, little is known regarding whether safety-net hospitals deliver more or less equitable breast reconstruction care in comparison with national cohorts. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective study of patients with either invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosed and treated at our institution (January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014). The rate of, timing of, and approach to breast reconstruction were assessed by race, ethnicity, insurance status, and primary language among women who underwent mastectomy. Reasons for not performing reconstruction were also analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 756 women with ductal carcinoma in situ or nonmetastatic invasive cancer were identified. The median age was 58.5 years, 56.2% were non-White, 33.1% were non-English-speaking, and 48.9% were Medicaid/uninsured patients. A total of 142 (18.8%) underwent mastectomy during their index operation. A total of 47.9% (n = 68) did not complete reconstruction. Reasons for not performing reconstruction included patient preference (n = 22), contraindication to immediate reconstruction (ie, locoregionally advanced disease prohibiting immediate reconstruction) without follow-up for consideration of delayed reconstruction (n = 12), prohibitive medical risk or contraindication (ie, morbid obesity; n = 8), and progression of disease, prohibiting reconstruction (n = 7). Immediate and delayed reconstruction were completed in 43.7% and 8.5% of patients. The rate of reconstruction was inversely associated with tumor stage (odds ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.88), but not race, ethnicity, insurance, or language, on multivariate regression. CONCLUSIONS: At a safety-net hospital, we observed rates of reconstruction at or greater than national estimates. After adjustment for clinical attributes, rates did not vary by race, ethnicity, insurance or language.

"Atrial fibrillation, cancer and anticancer drugs.",Font J; Milliez P; Ouazar AB; Klok FA; Alexandre J,"Active cancer is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), which varies depending on the pre-existing substrate (particularly in older patients), the cancer type and stage, and the anticancer therapeutics being taken. To date, studies have not been able to identify the individual contribution of each factor. During anticancer drug therapy, AF may occur with a frequency of ≈ 15-20% according to several factors, including the patient's baseline cardiovascular toxicity risk and the AF-detection strategies used. Many anticancer drugs have been associated with AF or AF reporting, both in terms of incident and recurrent AF, but robust data are lacking. Only bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor associated AF (mainly ibrutinib) has a high level of evidence, with a ≈ 3-4-fold higher risk of AF. AF in patients with active cancer is associated with a twofold higher risk of systemic thromboembolism or stroke, and the ""TBIP"" (Thromboembolic risk, Bleeding risk, drug-drug Interactions, Patient preferences) structured approach must be used to evaluate the need for anticoagulation therapy. AF in patients with active cancer is also associated with a sixfold higher risk of heart failure, and optimal symptom control must be targeted, usually with rate-control drugs (beta-blockers), but a rhythm-control strategy may be proposed in patients remaining symptomatic despite optimal rate-control. AF is generally manageable, with the continuation of anticancer drugs (including ibrutinib); interruption of cancer drugs must be avoided whenever possible and weighed against the risk of cancer progression.",2023,Apr,Arch Cardiovasc Dis,116,4,219-226,,10.1016/j.acvd.2023.02.005,37002156,#1346,Font 2023,,,0
Effect of standardised surgical assessment and shared decision-making on morbidity and patient satisfaction after breast conserving therapy: A cross-sectional study.,Aristokleous I; Öberg J; Pantiora E; Sjökvist O; Navia JE; Mani M; Karakatsanis A,"BACKGROUND: The role of oncoplastic breast conserving therapy (OPBCT) on physical function, morbidity and patient satisfaction has yet to be defined. Additionally, technique selection should be individualised and incorporate patient preference. The study aim was to investigate differences between ""standard"" (sBCT) and oncoplastic breast conservation (OPBCT) in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) when patients have been assessed in a standardised manner and technique selection has been reached through shared decision-making (SDM). METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 215 women treated at a tertiary referral centre. Standardised surgical assessment included breast and lesion volumetry, definition of resection ratio, patient-related risk factors and patient preference. Postoperative morbidity and patient satisfaction were assessed by validated PROs tools (Diseases of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand-DASH and Breast-Q). Patient experience was assessed by semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: There was no difference of the median values between OPBCT and sBCT in postoperative morbidity of the upper extremity (DASH 3.3 vs 5, p = 0.656) or the function of the chest wall (Breast-Q 82 vs 82, p = 0.758). Postoperative satisfaction with breasts did not differ either (Breast-Q 65 vs 61, p = 0.702). On the individual level, women that opted for OPBCT after SDM had improved satisfaction when compared to baseline (+3 vs -1, p = 0.001). Shared decision-making changed patient attitude in 69.8% of patients, leading most often to de-escalation from mastectomy.

Effect of switching from continuous to bilevel positive airway pressure on sleep quality in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: the prospective POP IN VAuto study.,Palot A; Nguyên XL; Launois S; Prigent A; Graml A; Aversenq E; Koltes C; Recart D; Lavergne F,"BACKGROUND: Issues with tolerability and side effects can decrease continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device usage and the benefits of therapy. Different positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy modes providing expiratory pressure relief or using a different pressure during inspiration vs. expiration (bilevel PAP) may alleviate some of these issues. This multicenter, prospective study evaluated the effects of switching from CPAP to bilevel PAP (VAuto mode) on respiratory parameters, device usage, side effects and patient-reported outcomes in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). METHODS: Eligible OSA patients had started CPAP ≥3 months previously, had good compliance (mean 6.1±2.0 h/night) and well-controlled OSA [residual apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 4.9±3.1/h] but had pressure tolerance issues or persistent side effects/discomfort. All were switched from CPAP to bilevel PAP (AirCurve 10 VAuto; ResMed). Effectiveness (residual AHI), sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, therapy-related side effects, and patient satisfaction/preference were assessed after 3 months and 1 year. RESULTS: Forty patients were analyzed (68% male, age 64±11 years, body mass index 30.7±5.8 kg/m(2)). At 3 months and 1 year after switching to bilevel PAP, median [interquartile range] residual AHI was 4/h [2-5.3] and 3.7/h [1.8-5], respectively, and device usage was 7.0 [4.9-7.5] and 6.4 [4.4-7.3] h/night, respectively. Device switch was associated with significant reductions from baseline in expiratory PAP {from 12 [11-13] to 8 [7-9] cmH(2)O at 3 months (P<0.001) and 9 [8-12] cmH(2)O at 1 year (P=0.005)}, 95(th) percentile pressure {from 14 [12-14] to 10 [9-11] and 10 [8-11] cmH2O; P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively} and leak {from 1 [0-6] to 0 [0-1] and 0 [0-2] L/min; P=0.049 and P=0.033, respectively}. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score decreased significantly from baseline to 3 and 6 months [7.2±4.0 to 5.0±3.2 (P=0.005) and 4.5±2.7 (P<0.001), respectively]. CPAP-related mouth dryness, choking sensation and aerophagia were significantly improved one year after switching to bilevel PAP. Bilevel PAP was preferred over CPAP by 90% of patients.

Telehealth adoption in cancer clinical trials: An Australian perspective.,Thomas EE; Kelly JT; Taylor ML; Mendis R; Banbury A; Haydon H; Catto J; Der Vartanian C; Smith AC; Caffery LJ,"INTRODUCTION: Cancer clinical trials have traditionally occurred in-person. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced adaptions of all aspects of cancer care (including clinical trials) so they can be delivered remotely. We aimed to quantify and qualify current use of telehealth and how it can be further improved and routinely integrated into cancer clinical trials in Australia. METHODS: We used a mixed-method study design, involving surveys of 14 multi-site Collaborative Cancer Clinical Trial Groups members across Australia (n = 98) and qualitative interviews with trial administrators and clinicians (n = 21). RESULTS: The results of our study indicated a strong willingness to use telehealth for certain transactions of clinical trials because it was perceived as a way of increasing efficiency and reach of services. Hybrid models (including telehealth and in-person methods), which considered transaction, cancer type, and patient preferences were most favorable. Additionally, telehealth allowed for greater equity to access and reduced trial burden but interestingly had little effect on increased diversity and recruitment. Factors influencing telehealth service implementation and uptake included communication among trial stakeholders, training, and learning from the experience of others in the clinical trials community. CONCLUSION: Many but not all aspects of clinical trial care are appropriate to be delivered via telehealth. A hybrid approach provides flexibility to trial delivery and may support greater equity of access to trials in the future. Our findings and actionable recommendations support the need for greater planning, training, and guidelines to enable telehealth to be better integrated into clinical trials. Opportunities exist to expand the use of remote patient monitoring to enable more objective data collection from trial participants in the future.",2023,Aug,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,19,4,549-558,,10.1111/ajco.13899,36480425,#1028,Thomas 2023,,,0
The role of the foam formulation in improving psoriasis treatment acceptability: a real-life experience and a literature review.,Martella A; Gasparini S; Papa S; Giovene GL,"BACKGROUND: Topical therapies represent the first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Among various topical options, the fixed-dose combination of calcipotriene (Cal) and betamethasone dipropionate (BD) foam (Enstilar®, LEO Pharma, Ballerup, Denmark) showed superior efficacy to Cal and BD monotherapy and ointment and gel formulations. In addition, the Cal/BD foam is the only topical treatment allowed for either reactive treatment of relapse or twice-weekly maintenance use. Since treatment acceptability is crucial to optimize adherence, this paper presents a case series from a multicenter experience using the Cal/BD foam, to further characterize the use of this therapeutic approach. In addition, a narrative review of studies evaluating the acceptability of the Cal/BD foam, even compared with other formulations, is provided. CASE SERIES: The case series involved adult patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis treated with the Cal/BD foam from October 2021 to June 2022. A clinical and dermoscopic evaluation of plaques was provided for all patients. Data from the clinical practice report complete clinical resolution of plaques in most patients after 4 weeks of active treatment with the Cal/BD foam, and the dermoscopic clearance after a maximum of 8 weeks. Full adherence to treatment was also reported. Literature evidence suggests that the Cal/BD foam is easy to apply and presents high cosmetic acceptance, rapid onset of action, high efficacy, optimal safety, and a high patient preference. The high satisfaction obtained with Cal/BD foam suggests that this formulation is better accepted than others. CONCLUSIONS: The Cal/BD foam represents a valuable approach for managing mild-to-moderate psoriasis, both in short and long-term treatment.",2023,Nov,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,27,21,10697-10704,,10.26355/eurrev_202311_34350,37975395,#704,Martella 2023,,,0
Psoriasis patient preferences for the use of biologics during the coronavirus era.,Tada Y; Itakura A; Hosono K; Kawamura T,"Understanding patient preferences concerning the use of biologics for psoriasis treatment can support proper treatment selection to satisfy their needs. In Japan, limited studies have reported psoriasis patients' preferences for the use of biologics, and many of those focused on the improvement of skin symptoms. The present study was conducted as a web-based questionnaire survey using the discrete choice experiment approach to investigate the preferences of psoriasis patients for the use of biologics, as well as to describe social and clinical factors that influence these preferences. The following attributes were selected for the discrete choice experiment: efficacy at 1 year, risk of serious infections requiring hospitalization, incidence of injection site reactions, administration route and visits, co-payment, indications, and efficacy on skin symptoms and other manifestations (the last two have not been evaluated in previous studies). Data were collected from October 4 to October 8, 2021. An analysis of data from 357 psoriasis patients indicated that the most preferred attributes for biologics selection were administration route and visits, followed by the risk of serious infections requiring hospitalization. Some differences were observed among specific subgroups. This study demonstrated that patients with psoriasis prefer biologics with a less frequent administration route and visit schedule and a lower risk of serious infections requiring hospitalization, which contrasts with the results obtained in previous studies where the highest importance was placed on drug effectiveness. These results may reflect the personal and social impact of the coronavirus disease outbreak at the time of the survey. The results of this study might help physicians properly select biologics that satisfy psoriasis patients' needs, leading to better treatment adherence.",2023,May,J Dermatol,50,5,596-607,,10.1111/1346-8138.16703,36628542,#1295,Tada 2023,,,1

Adjuvant treatment decisions among adults aged 65 years and older with early-stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer seen in a simple multidisciplinary clinic versus standard consultation.,English K; Alcorn SR; Tran HT; Smith KL; Wilkinson M; Hirose KT; O'Donnell M; Croog V; Wright JL,"INTRODUCTION: Randomized studies support de-escalation of adjuvant therapy for a target population of older adults ≥65 years with stage I, estrogen-receptor (ER) positive breast cancer after breast conserving surgery. We sought to evaluate the impact of a simplified multidisciplinary clinic (s-MDC) in this population by comparing treatment patterns and patient perceptions of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and hormone therapy (HT) between patients seen in s-MDC vs. standard consultations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for patients in the above target population who underwent surgery between August 2020 and May 2022 at our institution. Two cohorts were included: (1) patients seen in s-MDC, and (2) patients seen in standard clinic separately by medical and radiation oncology (non-s-MDC cohort). The non-s-MDC patients declined, could not attend, and/or were not referred to the s-MDC. Patients in the s-MDC cohort were prospectively administered validated questionnaires to evaluate patient reported data including the Decision Autonomy Preference Scale (DAPS), e-Prognosis, and Medical Maximizing-Minimizing Scale (MMS). Chi square, t-tests, and non-parametric equivalents compared demographics, and logistic regression evaluated RT and HT use and survey score outcomes between cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 127 patients met inclusion criteria, with 33 s-MDC and 94 non-s-MDC patients. There was no difference between the cohorts in age, margin status, histology, grade, or focality. In the s-MDC cohort there were significantly more patients without sentinel lymph node biopsy (71.3% vs 42.4%, p = 0.003) and mean tumor size was smaller (0.69 vs. 0.96 cm, p < 0.003), and Charlson comborbidity index (CCI) was higher (5.21 vs 4.96, p = 0.038). There was no significant difference in receipt of RT (65% s-MDC vs 77% standard; odds ratio [OR] = 0.55, p = 0.189), HT (78% ss-MDC vs 72% standard; OR = 1.36, p = 0.513), or both (50% s-MDC vs 59% standard; OR = 0.7, p = 0.429). The s-MDC cohort was significantly more likely to undergo accelerated (vs. standard hypofractionated) RT (70% vs 39%; OR = 3.59, p = 0.020). In s-MDC patients with completed questionnaires (n = 33), all whose selected ""mostly patient (n=6)"" based decision making by DAPS chose RT while all ""mostly doctor (n=1)"" chose no RT. Based on e-Prognosis, there were lower odds of RT for increasing Schonberg score/ higher 10 yr mortality risk (OR 0.600, p = 0.048). MMS score ≥ 40 (""maximizer"") was strongly linked with the use of RT (OR 18.57, p = 0.011). DISCUSSION: For adults ≥65 years with early stage, ER positive breast cancer, s-MDC participation was not significantly associated with lower use of adjuvant RT or HT versus standard consultation but was significantly associated with shorter RT courses. DAPS and MMS results indicate that patient treatment preference may be predictable, highlighting an opportunity to tailor consultation discussions and recommendations based on intrinsic patient preferences and individual goals.",2023,May,J Geriatr Oncol,14,4,101503,,10.1016/j.jgo.2023.101503,37126898,#1268,English 2023,,,0
Policy Preferences Regarding Health Data Sharing Among Patients With Cancer: Public Deliberations.,Raj M; Ryan K; Amara PS; Nong P; Calhoun K; Trinidad MG; Thiel D; Spector-Bagdady K; De Vries R; Kardia S; Platt J,"BACKGROUND: Precision health offers the promise of advancing clinical care in data-driven, evidence-based, and personalized ways. However, complex data sharing infrastructures, for-profit (commercial) and nonprofit partnerships, and systems for data governance have been created with little attention to the values, expectations, and preferences of patients about how they want to be engaged in the sharing and use of their health information. We solicited patient opinions about institutional policy options using public deliberation methods to address this gap. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand the policy preferences of current and former patients with cancer regarding the sharing of health information collected in the contexts of health information exchange and commercial partnerships and to identify the values invoked and perceived risks and benefits of health data sharing considered by the participants when formulating their policy preferences. METHODS: We conducted 2 public deliberations, including predeliberation and postdeliberation surveys, with patients who had a current or former cancer diagnosis (n=61). Following informational presentations, the participants engaged in facilitated small-group deliberations to discuss and rank policy preferences related to health information sharing, such as the use of a patient portal, email or SMS text messaging, signage in health care settings, opting out of commercial data sharing, payment, and preservation of the status quo. The participants ranked their policy preferences individually, as small groups by mutual agreement, and then again individually in the postdeliberation survey. RESULTS: After deliberation, the patient portal was ranked as the most preferred policy choice. The participants ranked no change in status quo as the least preferred policy option by a wide margin. Throughout the study, the participants expressed concerns about transparency and awareness, convenience, and accessibility of information about health data sharing. Concerns about the status quo centered around a lack of transparency, awareness, and control. Specifically, the patients were not aware of how, when, or why their data were being used and wanted more transparency in these regards as well as greater control and autonomy around the use of their health data. The deliberations suggested that patient portals would be a good place to provide additional information about data sharing practices but that over time, notifications should be tailored to patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests the need for increased disclosure of health information sharing practices. Describing health data sharing practices through patient portals or other mechanisms personalized to patient preferences would minimize the concerns expressed by patients about the extent of data sharing that occurs without their knowledge. Future research and policies should identify ways to increase patient control over health data sharing without reducing the societal benefits of data sharing.",2023,Jan,JMIR Cancer,9,,e39631,,10.2196/39631,36719719,#1575,Raj 2023,,,0
"Patient preferences do matter: a discrete choice experiment conducted with breast cancer patients in six European countries, with latent class analysis.",Stamuli E; Corry S; Foss P,"OBJECTIVES: The evolution of breast cancer (BC) treatments has resulted in tailored therapies for the different types and stages of BC. Each treatment has a profile of benefits and adverse effects which are taken into consideration when planning a treatment pathway. This study examines whether patients' preferences are in line with what is considered important from decision makers viewpoint. METHODS: An online discrete choice experiment was conducted in six European countries (France, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Spain, UK) with BC patients. Six attributes were included: overall survival (OS), hyperglycemia, rash, pain, functional well-being (FWB), and out-of-pocket payment (OOP). Sixteen choice sets with two hypothetical treatments and a ""No treatment"" option were presented. Data were analyzed with the use of heteroscedastic conditional, mixed logistic, and latent class models. Marginal rate of substitution (MRS) were estimated for OOP versus the rest of attributes to establish the ranking of preferences for each attribute. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-seven patients with advanced or metastatic BC and 314 with early-stage BC responded. Forty-nine percent of patients were < 44 years old and 65 percent had completed university education. The MRS of the analysis demonstrated that ""severe pain"" is the highest dis-preferred attribute level, followed by ""severe impairment in FWB"" and OS. Four classes of patients as ""decision makers"" were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that there is heterogeneity in treatment preferences of BC patients depending on their sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics. In combination with clinical guidelines, patient preferences can support the selection and tailoring of treatment options.",2023,Apr,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,39,1,e21,,10.1017/S0266462323000168,37074007,#1321,Stamuli 2023,,,1
The Effects of Changing Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Devices in Japanese Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Case Series.,Hamada S; Togawa J; Sunadome H; Nagasaki T; Hirai T; Sato S,"Objective The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in Japanese patients have not been reported. We assessed the effects of changing CPAP devices (from the Philips Respironics device to the ResMed device) on the control of OSA. Methods We retrospectively examined 13 patients with OSA who voluntarily changed from the Philips Respironics device to the ResMed device due to a Philips Respironics CPAP device recall. Data on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) were obtained from the CPAP devices for three months before and after changing the devices. Results The AHI obtained from the CPAP devices significantly decreased from 4.4 (3.1-10.7) events/h to 2.0 (0.8-3.6) events/h when patients changed devices (p=0.022). The AHI decreased to <5 events/h after changing devices in 4 patients, whereas it had been ≥5 events/h before changing devices in 6 patients.

Rural patient and provider perceptions of telehealth implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Klee D; Pyne D; Kroll J; James W; Hirko KA,"BACKGROUND: Understanding perceptions of telehealth  implementation from patients and providers can improve the utility and sustainability of these programs, particularly in under-resourced rural settings. The purpose of this study was to evaluate both patient and provider perceptions of telehealth visits in a large rural healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic. To promote sustainability of telehealth approaches, we also assessed whether the percentage of missed appointments differed between in-person and telehealth visits. METHODS: Using anonymous surveys, we evaluated patient preferences and satisfaction with telehealth visits from November 2020 -March 2021 and assessed perceptions of telehealth efficiency and value among rural providers from September-October 2020. We examined whether telehealth perceptions differed according to patients' age, educational attainment, insurance status, and distance to clinical site and providers' age and length of time practicing medicine using ANOVA test. We also examined whether the percentage of missed appointments differed between in-person and telehealth visits at a family practice clinic within the rural healthcare system from April to September 2020 using a Chi-square test. RESULTS: Over 73% of rural patients had favorable perceptions of telehealth visits, and satisfaction was generally higher among younger patients. Patients reported difficulty with scheduling follow-up appointments, lack of personal contact and technology challenges as common barriers. Over 80% of the 219 providers responding to the survey reported that telehealth added value to their practice, while 36.6% agreed that telehealth visits are more efficient than in-person visits. Perception of telehealth value and efficiency did not differ by provider age (p = 0.67 and p = 0.67, respectively) or time in practice (p = 0.53 and p = 0.44, respectively). Technology challenges for the patient (91.3%) and provider (45.1%) were commonly reported. The percentage of missed appointments was slightly higher for telehealth visits compared to in-person visits, but the difference was not statistically significant (8.7% vs. 8.0%; p = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth perceptions were generally favorable among rural patients and providers, although satisfaction was lower among older patients and providers. Our findings suggest that telehealth approaches may add value and efficiency to rural clinical practice. However, technology issues for both patients and providers and gaps in care coordination need to be addressed to promote sustainability of telehealth approaches in rural practice.",2023,Sep,BMC Health Serv Res,23,1,981,,10.1186/s12913-023-09994-4,37700286,#880,Klee 2023,,,0
Telehealth Complementary and Integrative Health Therapies During COVID-19 at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.,Der-Martirosian C; Shin M; Upham ML; Douglas JH; Zeliadt SB; Taylor SL,"Background: Complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies, such as in-person acupuncture, chiropractic care, and meditation, are evidence-based nonpharmaceutical treatment options for pain. During COVID-19, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) delivered several CIH therapies virtually. This study explores veterans' utilization, advantages/disadvantages, and delivery issues of yoga, Tai Chi, meditation/mindfulness (self-care), and massage, chiropractic, and acupuncture (practitioner-delivered care), using telephone/video at 18 VA sites during COVID-19. Methods: Use of virtual care was examined quantitatively with VA administrative data for six CIH therapies before and after COVID-19 onset (2019-2021). Advantages/disadvantages and health care delivery issues of these CIH therapies through virtual care were examined qualitatively using interview data (2020-2021). Results: Overall, televisits represented a substantial portion of all CIH self-care therapies delivered by VA in 2020 (53.7%) and 2021 (82.1%), as sites developed virtual group classes using VA secure online video platforms in response to COVID-19. In contrast, a small proportion of all encounters with acupuncturists, chiropractors, and massage therapists was telephone/video encounters in 2020 (17.3%) and in 2021 (5.4%). These were predominantly one-on-one care in the form of education, follow-ups, home exercises, assessments/evaluations, or acupressure. Delivery issues included technical difficulties, lack of access to needed technology, difficulty tracking virtual visits, and capacity restrictions. Advantages included increased access to self-care, increased patient receptivity to engaging in self-care, and flexibility in staffing online group classes. Disadvantages included patient preference, patient safety, and strain on staffing. Conclusion: Despite delivery issues or disadvantages of tele-CIH self-care, veterans' use of teleself-care CIH therapies grew substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2023,Apr,Telemed J E Health,29,4,576-583,,10.1089/tmj.2022.0209,35867052,#1380,Der-Martirosian 2023,,,0
Early Versus Delayed Oral Anticoagulation in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke Due to Atrial Fibrillation: A Meta-Analysis.,Tirumandyam G; Krishna Mohan GV; Addi Palle LR; Reyaz I; Haider S; Haseeb MD; Saleem F,"The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of early oral anticoagulation with delayed anticoagulant therapy in patients who have had a recent stroke and have atrial fibrillation (AF). This meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. The literature search was independently performed by two authors. We searched PubMed and Scopus using search strings that included the following terms: ""stroke,"" ""atrial fibrillation,"" ""oral anticoagulants,"" ""recurrent stroke,"" and ""intracerebral hemorrhage."" Our search spanned from the inception of databases to May 25, 2023. The primary outcome assessed in this study was the composite efficacy outcome (as defined by individual studies). Recurrent ischemic stroke (IS), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and death from any cause were assessed as secondary outcomes. For safety analysis, bleeding events were compared between the two study groups. We included five articles in this meta-analysis, comprising a total of 7958 patients (including 3793 in the early treatment group and 4165 in the delayed treatment group). Pooled analysis showed that the risk of composite efficacy outcome (RR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.51-0.93, p-value: 0.01) and recurrent ischemic stroke (RR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.53-0.94, p-value: 0.02) were lower in the early treatment group. However, no significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of all-cause mortality, intracranial hemorrhage, or bleeding events.

Endovascular Management of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,Ognard J; Magro E; Caroff J; Bodani V; Mosimann PJ; Gentric JC,"Due to the risk of cerebral hemorrhage, and its related morbidity-mortality, brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are a rare and potentially life-threatening disease. Despite this, there is only one randomized controlled trial on bAVM management, A Randomized trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous malformations (ARUBA). The results of the ARUBA trial favor a noninterventional approach in the case of an unruptured bAVM; however, implementation of these findings is challenging in daily practice. Instead, management of bAVM relies on multidisciplinary discussions that lead to patient-specific strategies based on patient preferences, local expertise, and experience in referral centers. Considering the diverse patterns of presentation and numerous treatment modalities, implementing standardized guidelines in this context proves challenging, notwithstanding the recommendations or expert opinions offered. Endovascular treatment (EVT) of bAVM can be curative, or can serve as an adjunct treatment prior to surgery or radiosurgery (""pre-EVT""). EVT practice is in constant evolution (i.e., venous approach, combination with surgery during the same anesthesia, etc.). Liquid embolic agents such as ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) copolymer and cyanoacrylates (CYA), and their method of injection to increase bAVM occlusion have also benefited from technical evolutions such as the use of adjunctive flow arrest techniques (mini balloons, pressure cooker technique, and multiple catheters). Further research is necessary to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of EVT for bAVM.",2023,Jun,Semin Neurol,43,3,323-336,,10.1055/a-2105-6614,37276887,#1181,Ognard 2023,,,0

Stakeholder Engagement in Designing Attributes for a Discrete Choice Experiment With Policy Implications: An Example of 2 Swiss Studies on Healthcare Delivery.,Föhn Z; Nicolet A; Marti J; Kaufmann C; Balthasar A,"OBJECTIVES: The use of discrete choice experiments (DCEs) has become increasingly popular in health policy development by involving and analyzing the preferences of target groups for different aspects of the policy intervention. In this article, we aim to contribute to the standardization of the process of attribute and attribute level development for DCEs with policy relevance. To do so, we propose and empirically illustrate a framework tool for the development and reporting of attributes and attribute levels, with the systematic engagement of relevant stakeholders. METHODS: The framework tool was kept general to allow its use as a standard reporting approach on the development process of a DCE, involving relevant stakeholders at each stage. The proposed 3-stage process consists of (1) collection, (2) selection, and (3) refinement of the DCE attributes and attribute levels. The application of the framework tool is illustrated by 2 projects, Health2040 and COCONUTS-both concerning the preferences of the Swiss population for the future organization of healthcare. RESULTS: By engaging stakeholders, we identified and included attributes and attribute levels that would not have been identified solely through the existing literature. In addition, including multiple stakeholders from different professional backgrounds ensured that the selected attributes and attribute levels were policy relevant, were applicable in practice, and reflected the opinions of multiple actors in healthcare. CONCLUSION: The proposed framework helps to strengthen the standardization of the reporting on attribute and attribute level development with stakeholder engagement and to guide future research teams designing a DCE with policy implications.",2023,Jun,Value Health,26,6,925-933,,10.1016/j.jval.2023.01.002,36646277,#1212,Föhn 2023,,,1
Managing Psoriatic Arthritis Patients Presenting with Axial Symptoms.,Poddubnyy D,"Axial symptoms (i.e., back pain) are common in the general population. At the same time 25-70% of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) exhibit signs of inflammatory axial involvement (axial PsA). The presence of unexplained chronic (duration ≥ 3 months) back pain in a patient with psoriasis or PsA should trigger evaluation of the presence of axial involvement. Evaluation of axial involvement normally involves imaging of the axial skeleton (sacroiliac joints and/or spine) in addition to clinical and laboratory evaluation. Symptomatic patients with confirmed axial PsA are treated with a combination of non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic methods including the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tumour necrosis factor, interleukin 17, and Janus kinase inhibitors. Interleukin 23 blockade might also be effective in the axial domain of PsA; a dedicated clinical study is ongoing at present.

Artificial Intelligence in Health Care-Understanding Patient Information Needs and Designing Comprehensible Transparency: Qualitative Study.,Robinson R; Liday C; Lee S; Williams IC; Wright M; An S; Nguyen E,"BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) is as a branch of computer science that uses advanced computational methods such as machine learning (ML), to calculate and/or predict health outcomes and address patient and provider health needs. While these technologies show great promise for improving healthcare, especially in diabetes management, there are usability and safety concerns for both patients and providers about the use of AI/ML in healthcare management. OBJECTIVES: To support and ensure safe use of AI/ML technologies in healthcare, the team worked to better understand: 1) patient information and training needs, 2) the factors that influence patients' perceived value and trust in AI/ML healthcare applications; and 3) on how best to support safe and appropriate use of AI/ML enabled devices and applications among people living with diabetes. METHODS: To understand general patient perspectives and information needs related to the use of AI/ML in healthcare, we conducted a series of focus groups (n=9) and interviews (n=3) with patients (n=40) and interviews with providers (n=6) in Alaska, Idaho, and Virginia. Grounded Theory guided data gathering, synthesis, and analysis. Thematic content and constant comparison analysis were used to identify relevant themes and sub-themes. Inductive approaches were used to link data to key concepts including preferred patient-provider-interactions, patient perceptions of trust, accuracy, value, assurances, and information transparency. RESULTS: Key summary themes and recommendations focused on: 1) patient preferences for AI/ML enabled device and/or application information; 2) patient and provider AI/ML-related device and/or application training needs; 3) factors contributing to patient and provider trust in AI/ML enabled devices and/or application; and 4) AI/ML-related device and/or application functionality and safety considerations. A number of participant (patients and providers) recommendations to improve device functionality to guide information and labeling mandates (e.g., links to online video resources, and access to 24/7 live in-person or virtual emergency support). Other patient recommendations include: 1) access to practice devices; 2) connection to local supports and reputable community resources; 3) simplified display and alert limits. CONCLUSION: Recommendations from both patients and providers could be used by Federal Oversight Agencies to improve utilization of AI/ML monitoring of technology use in diabetes, improving device safety and efficacy.",2023,,JMIR AI,2,,,,10.2196/46487,38333424,#1606,Robinson 2023,,,0

CAPER: patient preferences to inform nonsurgical treatment of chronic low back pain: a discrete-choice experiment.,Wilson L; Zheng P; Ionova Y; Denham A; Yoo C; Ma Y; Greco CM; Hanmer J; Williams DA; Hassett AL; Scheffler AW; Valone F; Mehling W; Berven S; Lotz J; O'Neill C,"OBJECTIVE: We developed and used a discrete-choice measure to study patient preferences with regard to the risks and benefits of nonsurgical treatments when they are making treatment selections for chronic low back pain. METHODS: ""CAPER TREATMENT"" (Leslie Wilson) was developed with standard choice-based conjoint procedures (discrete-choice methodology that mimics an individual's decision-making process). After expert input and pilot testing, our final measure had 7 attributes (chance of pain relief, duration of relief, physical activity changes, treatment method, treatment type, treatment time burden, and risks of treatment) with 3-4 levels each. Using Sawtooth software (Sawtooth Software, Inc., Provo, UT, USA), we created a random, full-profile, balanced-overlap experimental design. Respondents (n = 211) were recruited via an emailed online link and completed 14 choice-based conjoint choice pairs; 2 fixed questions; and demographic, clinical, and quality-of-life questions. Analysis was performed with random-parameters multinomial logit with 1000 Halton draws. RESULTS: Patients cared most about the chance of pain relief, followed closely by improving physical activity, even more than duration of pain relief. There was comparatively less concern about time commitment and risks. Gender and socioeconomic status influenced preferences, especially with relation to strength of expectations for outcomes. Patients experiencing a low level of pain (Pain, Enjoyment, and General Activity Scale [PEG], question 1, numeric rating scale score<4) had a stronger desire for maximally improved physical activity, whereas those in a high level of pain (PEG, question 1, numeric rating scale score>6) preferred both maximum and more limited activity. Highly disabled patients (Oswestry Disability Index score>40) demonstrated distinctly different preferences, placing more weight on achieving pain control and less on improving physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with chronic low back pain were willing to trade risks and inconveniences for better pain control and physical activity. Additionally, different preference phenotypes exist, which suggests a need for clinicians to target treatments to particular patients.",2023,Aug,Pain Med,24,8,963-973,,10.1093/pm/pnad038,36975607,#1023,Wilson 2023,,,1
Patient's preference for sacrospinous hysteropexy or modified Manchester operation: A discrete choice experiment.,Schulten SFM; Essers B; Notten KJB; Enklaar RA; van Leijsen SAL; van Eijndhoven HWF; Kluivers KB; Weemhoff M,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate women's preference for modified Manchester (MM) or sacrospinous hysteropexy (SH) as surgery for uterine prolapse. DESIGN: Labelled discrete choice experiment (DCE). SETTING: Eight Dutch hospitals. POPULATION: Women with uterine prolapse, eligible for primary surgery and preference for uterus preservation. METHODS: DCEs are attribute-based surveys. The two treatment options were labelled as MM and SH. Attributes in this survey were treatment success ( levels SH: 84%, 89%, 94%; levels MM: 89%, 93%, 96%), dyspareunia (levels: 0%, 5%, 10%), cervical stenosis (levels: 1%, 6%, 11%) and severe buttock pain (levels: 0%, 1%). A different combination of attribute levels was used in each choice set. Women completed nine choice sets, making a choice based on attribute levels. Data were analysed in multinomial logit models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women's preference for MM or SH. RESULTS: 137 DCEs were completed (1233 choice sets). SH was chosen in 49% of the choice sets, MM in 51%. Of all women, 39 (28%) always chose the same surgery. After exclusion of this group, 882 choice sets were analysed, in which women preferred MM, likely associated with a labelling effect, i.e. description of the procedure, rather than the tested attributes. In that group, MM was chosen in 53% of the choice sets and SH in 47%. When choosing MM, next to the label, dyspareunia was relevant for decision-making. For SH, all attributes were relevant for decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: The preference of women for MM or SH seems almost equally divided. The variety in preference supports the importance of individualised healthcare.",2023,Jan,BJOG,130,1,99-106,,10.1111/1471-0528.17280,36043332,#1661,SchultenSFM 2023,,,1
Racial disparities in the pharmacological treatment of insomnia: A time-to-event analysis using real-world data.,Holler E; Campbell NL; Boustani M; Dexter P; Ben Miled Z; Owora A,"OBJECTIVE: Examine the association between race and time to pharmacologic treatment of insomnia in a large multi-institutional cohort. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of electronic medical records from a regional health information exchange. Eligible patients included adults with at least one healthcare visit per year from 2010 to 2019, a new insomnia diagnosis code during the study period, and no prior insomnia diagnosis codes or medications. A Cox frailty model was used to examine the association between race and time to an insomnia medication after diagnosis. RESULTS: In total, 9557 patients were analyzed, 7773 (81.3%) of whom where White, 1294 (13.5%) Black, 238 (2.5%) Other, and 252 (2.6%) unknown race. About 6.2% of Black and 8% of Other race patients received an order for a Food and Drug Administration-approved insomnia medication after diagnosis compared with 13.5% of White patients. Black patients were significantly less likely to have an order for a Food and Drug Administration-approved insomnia medication at all time points (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] range: 0.37-0.73), and patients reporting Other race were less likely to have received an order at 2 (aHR 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.94), 3 (aHR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13-0.79), and 4 years (aHR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.71) of follow-up. Similar results were observed in a sensitivity analysis including off-label medications. CONCLUSIONS: Patients belonging to racial minority groups are less likely to be prescribed an insomnia medication than White patients after accounting for sociodemographic and clinical factors. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which patient preferences and physician perceptions affect these prescribing patterns and investigate potential disparities in nonpharmacologic treatment.",2023,Apr,Sleep Health,9,2,128-135,,10.1016/j.sleh.2023.02.002,36858835,#1356,Holler 2023,,,0
The Experiences of Older Adults Living With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Scoping Review.,Rohatinsky N; Russell B; Read KB,"The prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease is rising in persons older than 65 years. Although there is extensive literature on inflammatory bowel disease in older adults from a disease-related outcome, epidemiological, and treatment perspective, the older adult perspective on inflammatory bowel disease-related care needs and experiences is not well represented. This scoping review examines the existing literature regarding the care experiences of older adults living with inflammatory bowel disease. A systematic search was conducted using 3 concepts: older adults, inflammatory bowel disease, and patient experience. Seven publications met the inclusion criteria. Reported data include study design and methods, sample characteristics, and findings relevant to the research question. Two themes were identified: preferences for interactions with healthcare personnel and peer support networks, and barriers to accessing care for inflammatory bowel disease needs. An overarching concept across all studies was the need and request for individualized, patient-centered care where patient preferences are considered. This review highlights the need for more research on the older adult age group to guide evidence-informed practice that meets their individual inflammatory bowel disease care needs.",2023,Jul-Aug,Gastroenterol Nurs,46,4,296-308,,10.1097/SGA.0000000000000737,37158397,#1112,Rohatinsky 2023,,,0
How can patient preferences be used and communicated in the regulatory evaluation of medicinal products? Findings and recommendations from IMI PREFER and call to action.,Janssens R; Barbier L; Muller M; Cleemput I; Stoeckert I; Whichello C; Levitan B; Hammad TA; Girvalaki C; Ventura JJ; Bywall KS; Pinto CA; Schoefs E; Katz EG; Kihlbom U; Huys I,"Objective: Patients have unique insights and are (in-)directly affected by each decision taken throughout the life cycle of medicinal products. Patient preference studies (PPS) assess what matters most to patients, how much, and what trade-offs patients are willing to make. IMI PREFER was a six-year European public-private partnership under the Innovative Medicines Initiative that developed recommendations on how to assess and use PPS in medical product decision-making, including in the regulatory evaluation of medicinal products. This paper aims to summarize findings and recommendations from IMI PREFER regarding i) PPS applications in regulatory evaluation, ii) when and how to consult with regulators on PPS, iii) how to reflect PPS in regulatory communication and iv) barriers and open questions for PPS in regulatory decision-making. Methods: PREFER performed six literature reviews, 143 interviews and eight focus group discussions with regulators, patient representatives, industry representatives, Health Technology Assessment bodies, payers, academics, and clincians between October 2016 and May 2022. Results: i) With respect to PPS applications, prior to the conduct of clinical trials of medicinal products, PPS could inform regulators' understanding of patients' unmet needs and relevant endpoints during horizon scanning activities and scientific advice. During the evaluation of a marketing authorization application, PPS could inform: a) the assessment of whether a product meets an unmet need, b) whether patient-relevant clinical trial endpoints and outcomes were studied, c) the understanding of patient-relevant effect sizes and acceptable trade-offs, and d) the identification of key (un-)favorable effects and uncertainties. ii) With respect to consulting with regulators on PPS, PPS researchers should ideally have early discussions with regulators (e.g., during scientific advice) on the PPS design and research questions. iii) Regarding external PPS communication, PPS could be reflected in the assessment report and product information (e.g., the European Public Assessment Report and the Summary of Product Characteristics). iv) Barriers relevant to the use of PPS in regulatory evaluation include a lack of PPS use cases and demonstrated impact on regulatory decision-making, and need for (financial) incentives, guidance and quality criteria for implementing PPS results in regulatory decision-making. Open questions concerning regulatory PPS use include: a) should a product independent broad approach to the design of PPS be taken and/or a product-specific one, b) who should optimally be financing, designing, conducting, and coordinating PPS, c) when (within and/or outside clinical trials) to perform PPS, and d) how can PPS use best be operationalized in regulatory decisions. Conclusion: PPS have high potential to inform regulators on key unmet needs, endpoints, benefits, and risks that matter most to patients and their acceptable trade-offs. Regulatory guidelines, templates and checklists, together with incentives are needed to foster structural and transparent PPS submission and evaluation in regulatory decision-making. More PPS case studies should be conducted and submitted for regulatory assessment to enable regulatory discussion and increase regulators' experience with PPS implementation and communication in regulatory evaluations.",2023,,Front Pharmacol,14,,1192770,,10.3389/fphar.2023.1192770,37663265,#974,Janssens 2023,,,1
Intersectional race and gender disparities in kidney transplant access in the United States: a scoping review.,Gompers A; Rossi A; Harding JL,"BACKGROUND: Gender and racial disparities in kidney transplant access are well established, however how gender and race interact to shape access to kidney transplant is less clear. Therefore, we examined existing literature to assess what is known about the potential interaction of gender and race and the impact on access to kidney transplantation in the US. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a scoping review and included quantitative and qualitative studies published in English between 1990 and May 31, 2023 among adult end-stage kidney disease patients in the US. All studies reported on access to specific transplant steps or perceived barriers to transplant access in gender and race subgroups, and the intersection between the two. We narratively synthesized findings across studies. RESULTS: Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria and included outcomes of referral (n = 4, 29%), evaluation (n = 2, 14%), waitlisting (n = 4, 29%), transplantation (n = 5, 36%), provider perceptions of patient transplant candidacy (n = 3, 21%), and patient preferences and requests for a living donor (n = 5, 36%). Overall, we found that White men have the greatest access at all steps of the transplant process, from referral to eventual living or deceased donor transplantation. In contrast, women from racial or ethnic minorities tend to have the lowest access to kidney transplant, in particular living donor transplant, though this was not consistent across all studies. CONCLUSIONS: Examining how racism and sexism interact to shape kidney transplant access should be investigated in future research, in order to ultimately shape policies and interventions to improve equity.",2024,Jan,BMC Nephrol,25,1,36,,10.1186/s12882-023-03453-2,38273245,#455,Gompers 2024,,,0
Treatment of Granulomatous Inflammation in Pulmonary Sarcoidosis.,Gerke AK,"The management of pulmonary sarcoidosis is a complex interplay of disease characteristics, the impact of medications, and patient preferences. Foremost, it is important to weigh the risk of anti-granulomatous treatment with the benefits of lung preservation and improvement in quality of life. Because of its high spontaneous resolution rate, pulmonary sarcoidosis should only be treated in cases of significant symptoms due to granulomatous inflammation, lung function decline, or substantial inflammation on imaging that can lead to irreversible fibrosis. The longstanding basis of treatment has historically been corticosteroid therapy for the control of granulomatous inflammation. However, several corticosteroid-sparing options have increasing evidence for use in refractory disease, inability to taper steroids to an acceptable dose, or in those with toxicity to corticosteroids. Treatment of sarcoidosis should be individualized for each patient due to the heterogeneity of the clinical course, comorbid conditions, response to therapy, and tolerance of medication side effects.",2024,Jan,J Clin Med,13,3,,,10.3390/jcm13030738,38337432,#452,Gerke 2024,,,0
Cardiac rehabilitation for heart failure: 'Cinderella' or evidence-based pillar of care?,Taylor RS; Dalal HM; Zwisler AD,"Cardiac rehabilitation remains the 'Cinderella' of treatments for heart failure. This state-of-the-art review provides a contemporary update on the evidence base, clinical guidance, and status of cardiac rehabilitation delivery for patients with heart failure. Given that cardiac rehabilitation participation results in important improvements in patient outcomes, including health-related quality of life, this review argues that an exercise-based rehabilitation is a key pillar of heart failure management alongside drug and medical device provision. To drive future improvements in access and uptake, health services should offer heart failure patients a choice of evidence-based modes of rehabilitation delivery, including home, supported by digital technology, alongside traditional centre-based programmes (or combinations of modes, 'hybrid') and according to stage of disease and patient preference.",2023,May,Eur Heart J,44,17,1511-1518,,10.1093/eurheartj/ehad118,36905176,#1280,Taylor 2023,,,0
Clinical Practices Surrounding the Prescription of Home Oxygen in Patients With COPD and Desaturation.,Zaeh SE; Case M; Au DH; DaSilva M; Deitemeyer K; DeLisa J; Feemster LC; Gerald LB; Krishnan JA; Sculley J; Woodruff A; Eakin MN,"PURPOSE: While home oxygen therapy increases survival in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have severe resting hypoxemia, recent evidence suggests that there is no survival benefit of home oxygen for patients with COPD who have isolated exertional desaturation. We aimed to understand clinician practice patterns surrounding the prescription of home oxygen for patients with COPD. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews via videoconference with 15 physicians and 3 nurse practitioners who provide care for patients with COPD. Clinicians were recruited through the American Lung Association Airways Clinical Research Centers. Interview guides were created with the assistance of patient investigators and included questions regarding clinician practices surrounding the prescription of oxygen for patients with COPD and the use of clinical guidelines. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded for themes. RESULTS: Of the 18 clinician interviewees, one-third were women, with most participants (n=11) being < 50 years old. Results of the semi-structured interviews suggested research evidence, clinical experience, and patient preferences contributed to clinician decision-making. Most clinicians described a shared decision-making process for prescribing home oxygen for patients, including discussion of risks and benefits, and developing an understanding of patient values and preferences. Clinicians did not use a structured tool to conduct these conversations. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians consider a number of patient and clinical factors when prescribing home oxygen therapy, often using a shared decision-making process. Tools to support shared decision-making about the use of home oxygen are needed.",2023,Oct,Chronic Obstr Pulm Dis,10,4,343-354,,10.15326/jcopdf.2023.0402,37433062,#764,Zaeh 2023,,,0

Endometrial ablation techniques in treating menorrhagia.,Samala M; Pasupula SS; Mudigonda S; Tadikonda RR,"Menorrhagia is a frequent gynecological problem that is clinically described as excessive blood loss of 80 mL per menstrual cycle. It has the potential to lower their quality of life and to induce anemia. Medical therapy has typically been the first line of treatment; however, it is frequently ineffectual. Hysterectomy, on the other hand, is clearly 100 percent effective in stopping bleeding, but it is more expensive and can cause serious problems. So, the endometrial ablation is preferred when the endometrial layer is destroyed or removed during the procedure. To ""ablate"" (remove) the endometrial lining, a variety of procedures has been devised. The gold standard resectoscopic procedures (laser, transcervical endometrial resection, and rollerball) require hysteroscopic visualization of the uterus and while safe, necessitate expert surgeons. Several innovative procedures have lately been developed, the majority of which may be conducted blindly and take less time. Many nonresectoscopic procedures are still in the process of being developed, refined, and investigated. This article discusses the various techniques and procedures used in endometrial ablation, the importance of the physician using endometrial thinning agents because success rates are higher when thinning agents are used, and the importance of women understanding the complications mainly related to pregnancy. Women should be helped to make informed management decisions by discussing the risks and benefits of each treatment with their consultant. Since there are many treatment options available, with no one option being superior in all respects, patient preference and treatment preferences should be considered when deciding on management.",2023,Jun,Minerva Obstet Gynecol,75,3,279-287,,10.23736/S2724-606X.22.05101-6,35912462,#1219,Samala 2023,,,0
"Discrepancy in responses to the surprise question between hemodialysis nurses and physicians, with focus on patient clinical characteristics: A comparative study.",Wallin JM; Jacobson SH; Axelsson L; Lindberg J; Persson CI; Stenberg J; Wennman-Larsen A,"INTRODUCTION: The surprise question (SQ) ""Would I be surprised if this patient died within the next xx months"" can be used by different professions to foresee the need of serious illness conversations in patients approaching end of life. However, little is known about the different perspectives of nurses and physicians in responses to the SQ and factors influencing their appraisals. The aim was to explore nurses' and physicians' responses to the SQ regarding patients on hemodialysis, and to investigate how these answers were associated with patient clinical characteristics. METHODS: This comparative cross-sectional study included 361 patients for whom 112 nurses and 15 physicians responded to the SQ regarding 6 and 12 months. Patient characteristics, performance status, and comorbidities were obtained. Cohen's kappa was used to analyze the interrater agreement between nurses and physicians in their responses to the SQ and multivariable logistic regression was applied to reveal the independent association to patient clinical characteristics. FINDINGS: Proportions of nurses and physicians responding to the SQ with ""no, not surprised"" was similar regarding 6 and 12 months. However, there was a substantial difference concerning which specific patient the nurses and physicians responded ""no, not surprised"", within 6 (κ = 0.366, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.288-0.474) and 12 months (κ = 0.379, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.281-0.477). There were also differences in the patient clinical characteristics associated with nurses' and physicians' responses to the SQ. DISCUSSION: Nurses and physicians have different perspectives in their appraisal when responding to the SQ for patients on hemodialysis. This may reinforce the need for communication and discussion between nurses and physicians to identify the need of serious illness conversations in patients approaching the end of life, in order to adapt hemodialysis care to patient preferences and needs.",2023,Oct,Hemodial Int,27,4,454-464,,10.1111/hdi.13103,37318069,#837,Wallin 2023,,,0
How can we elicit health workers' preferences for measures to reduce informal payments? A mixed methods approach to developing a discrete choice experiment in Tanzania.,Binyaruka P; Angell B; McKee M; Andreoni A; Mamdani M; Hutchinson E; Balabanova D,"OBJECTIVE: While discrete choice experiments (DCEs) have been used in other fields as a means of eliciting respondent preferences, these remain relatively new in studying corrupt practices in the health sector. This study documents and discusses the process of developing a DCE to inform policy measures aimed at addressing informal payments for healthcare in Tanzania. DESIGN: A mixed methods design was used to systematically develop attributes for the DCE. It involved five stages: a scoping literature review, qualitative interviews, a workshop with health providers and managers, expert review and a pilot study. SETTING: Dar es Salaam and Pwani regions in Tanzania. PARTICIPANTS: Health workers and health managers. RESULTS: A large number of factors were identified as driving informal payments in Tanzania and thus represent potential areas for policy intervention. Through iterative process involving different methods (qualitative and quantitative) and seeking consensus views by diverse actors, we derived six attributes for a DCE: mode of payment, supervision at the facility level, opportunity for private practice, awareness and monitoring, disciplinary measures against informal payments and incentive payment for staff if a facility has less informal payments. 12 choice sets were generated and piloted with 15 health workers from 9 health facilities. The pilot study revealed that respondents could easily understand the attributes and levels, answered all the choice sets and appeared to be trading between the attributes. The results from the pilot study had expected signs for all attributes. CONCLUSIONS: We elicited attributes and levels for a DCE to identify the acceptability and preferences of potential policy interventions to address informal payments in Tanzania through a mixed-methods approach. We argue that more attention is needed to the process of defining attributes for the DCE, which needs to be rigorous and transparent in order to derive reliable and policy-relevant findings.",2023,Jul,BMJ Open,13,7,e068781,,10.1136/bmjopen-2022-068781,37419635,#1071,Binyaruka 2023,,,1
Eliciting preferences of persons with dementia and informal caregivers to support ageing in place in the Netherlands: a protocol for a discrete choice experiment.,Vullings I; Wammes J; Uysal-Bozkir Ö; Smits C; Labrie NHM; Swait JD; de Bekker-Grob E; Macneil-Vroomen JL,"INTRODUCTION: Ageing in place (AIP) for persons with dementia is encouraged by European governments and societies. Healthcare packages may need reassessment to account for the preferences of care funders, patients and informal caregivers. By providing insight into people's preferences, discrete choice experiments (DCEs) can help develop consensus between stakeholders. This protocol paper outlines the development of a Dutch national study to cocreate a healthcare package design methodology built on DCEs that is person-centred and helps support informal caregivers and persons with dementia to AIP. A subpopulation analysis of persons with dementia with a migration background is planned due to their high risk for dementia and under-representation in research and care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The DCE is designed to understand how persons with dementia and informal caregivers choose between different healthcare packages. Qualitative methods are used to identify and prioritise important care components for persons with dementia to AIP. This will provide a list of care components that will be included in the DCE, to quantify the care needs and preferences of persons with dementia and informal caregivers. The DCE will identify individual and joint preferences to AIP. The relative importance of each attribute will be calculated. The DCE data will be analysed with the use of a random parameters logit model. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was waived by the Amsterdam University Medical Center (W23_112 #23.137). A study summary will be available on the websites of Alzheimer Nederland, Pharos and Amsterdam Public Health institute.

Shared Decision Making and the Management of Intact Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Scoping Review of the Literature.,Machin M; Van Herzeele I; Ubbink D; Powell JT,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to summarise the current knowledge of shared decision making (SDM) in patients facing a treatment decision about an intact abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and to identify where further evidence is needed. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched on 18 July 2021. An updated search was run on 31 May 2022 for relevant studies published from 1 January 2000 to 31 May 2022. REVIEW METHODS: This scoping review was undertaken in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines following a pre-defined protocol, retrieving studies reporting on aspects of SDM in those with intact AAAs. Qualitative synthesis of the articles was performed, and the results grouped according to theme. RESULTS: Fifteen articles reporting on a total of 1 344 participants (age range 62-74 years) from hospital vascular surgery clinics with intact AAAs were included. Studies were observational (n = 9), non-randomised studies of an intervention (n = 3), and randomised clinical trials (n = 3). The first theme was the preferences and practice of SDM. The proportion of patients preferring SDM ranged from 58% to 95% (three studies), although objective rating of SDM practice was consistently < 50% (three studies). Clinician training improved SDM practice. The second theme was poor provision of information. Fewer than half of patients (0 - 46%) surveyed were informed about all available treatment options (three studies). Publicly available information sources were rated as poor. The third theme concerned the utility of decision making support tools (DSTs). Two randomised trials demonstrated that the provision of DSTs improves patient knowledge and agreement between patient preference and repair type received but not objective measures of SDM for patients with AAAs. CONCLUSION: SDM for patients with an intact AAA appears to be in its infancy. Most patients with an AAA want SDM, but this is not commonly applied. Most patients with an AAA do not receive adequate information for SDM, although the use of bespoke DSTs leaves patients better informed to facilitate SDM.",2023,Jun,Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,65,6,839-849,,10.1016/j.ejvs.2023.01.036,36720426,#1211,Machin 2023,Ileana Baldi (2024-09-26 02:52:26)(Select): Includes a best-worst scaling study among retrieved studies; ,,1
Comparative study between mitomycin C versus Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) in high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.,Zaza MMA; Salem TAE; El-Sadat AM; Hassan Ali M,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the efficacy and adverse events of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) versus Mitomycin C (MMC) in high-risk Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) patients. METHODS: This randomized controlled study was conducted over 24 months in four hospitals in Egypt. A sample of 90 patients was randomly assigned to either treatment group, with procedures including baseline examinations, a single postoperative instillation of chemotherapy, a 6-week induction cycle of the assigned drug, and regular follow-up cystoscopies and upper urinary tract imaging. Treatment results and side effects were monitored, with data analyzed via Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in mean age or tumor characteristics (p > 0.05). However, adverse reactions were significantly higher in the BCG group, including cystitis (40% vs. 17.78%, p = 0.020), hematuria (24.44% vs. 4.44%, p = 0.007), overall local reactions (75.56% vs. 26.67%, p < 0.001), fever (13.33% vs. 2.22%, p = 0.049), and fatigue (17.78% vs. 2.22%, p = 0.014). The MMC group had a slightly higher recurrence rate (28.89% vs. 17.78%, hazard ratio 1.89, 95% CI: 0.78-4.55, p = 0.15) with a shorter median time to recurrence (six vs. 12 months). Progression rates were similar (8.89% MMC vs. 4.44% BCG, p = 0.398). CONCLUSION: Although BCG and MMC have comparable efficacy in managing high-risk NMIBC, BCG demonstrated a higher rate of adverse reactions. Decision-making should consider this balance, patient preferences, and health status. Further research is needed for the validation and exploration of these findings.",2024,Feb,Urologia,91,1,61-68,,10.1177/03915603231206603,37905506,#431,ZazaMMA 2024,,,0
Laparoscopic versus robotic inguinal hernia repair: a single-center case-matched study.,Ayuso SA; Marturano MN; Katzen MM; Aladegbami BG; Augenstein VA,"INTRODUCTION: Robotic inguinal hernia repair (RIHR) is becoming increasingly common and is the minimally invasive alternative to laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR). Thus far, there is little data directly comparing LIHR and RIHR. The purpose of this study will be to compare outcomes for LIHR and RIHR at a single center. METHODS: A prospective institutional hernia database was queried for patients who underwent transabdominal LIHR or RIHR from 2012 to 2020. The patients were then matched based on the surgeon performing the operation (single, expert hernia surgeon) and laterality of repair. Standard descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: There were 282 patients who met criteria for the study, 141 LIHR and 141 RIHR; 32.6% of patients in each group had a bilateral repair (p = 1.00). LIHR patients were slightly younger (54.4 ± 15.6 vs 58.6 ± 13.8; p = 0.03) but similar in terms of BMI (27.1 ± 5.1 vs 29.1 ± 2.1; p = 0.70) and number of comorbidities (2.9 ± 2.5 vs 2.6 ± 2.2; p = 0.59). Operative time was found to be longer in the RIHR group, but when evaluating RIHR at the beginning of the study versus the end of the study, there was a 50-min decrease in operative time (p < 0.01). Recurrence rates were low for both groups (0.7% vs 1.4%; p = 0.38) with mean follow-up time 13.0 ± 13.3 months. There was only one wound infection, which was in the robotic group. No patients required return to the operating room for complications relating to their surgery. There were no 30-day readmissions in the LIHR group and three 30-day readmissions in the RIHR group (p = 0.28). CONCLUSION: LIHR and RIHR are both performed with low morbidity and have comparable overall outcomes. The total charges were increased in the RIHR group. Either LIHR or RIHR may be considered when performing inguinal hernia repair and should depend on surgeon and patient preference; continued evaluation of the outcomes is warranted.",2023,Jan,Surg Endosc,37,1,631-637,,10.1007/s00464-022-09368-7,35902404,#1669,Ayuso 2023,,,0
Patient Preferences for Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests in Light of Lowering the Screening Age to 45 Years.,Makaroff KE; Shergill J; Lauzon M; Khalil C; Ahluwalia SC; Spiegel BMR; Almario CV,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: In 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force lowered the colorectal cancer (CRC) screening age to 45 years. We used conjoint analysis, a method that assesses complex decision making, to update our understanding on people's CRC screening test preferences in the context of new guidelines. METHODS: We conducted a conjoint analysis survey among unscreened individuals ≥40 years at average risk for CRC to determine the relative importance of screening test attributes in their decision making (eg, modality, effectiveness at reducing CRC risk, bowel prep). We also performed simulations to estimate the proportion of people who would prefer each US Multi-Society Task Force (MSTF) on CRC-recommended test. The analyses were stratified among those aged 40-49 years (newly or soon-to-be eligible for screening) and ≥50 years (have been eligible). RESULTS: Overall, 1000 participants completed the conjoint analysis (40-49 years, n = 456; ≥50 years, n = 544). When considering all 5 US MSTF-recommended tests, there were differences in test preferences between age groups (P = .019), and the most preferred test was a fecal immunochemical test (FIT)-fecal DNA every 3 years: 40-49 years, 34.6%; ≥50 years, 37.3%. When considering only the US MSTF tier 1 tests, most 40- to 49- (68.9%) and ≥50-year-olds (77.4%; P = .004) preferred an annual FIT over a colonoscopy every 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that more than one-third of people may want to do a FIT-fecal DNA every 3 years for their CRC screening. When only considering US MSTF tier 1 tests, three-fourths of people may prefer an annual FIT over colonoscopy. Further research examining CRC screening test preferences among broader populations is warranted to inform and enhance screening programs.",2023,Feb,Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,21,2,520-531.e10,,10.1016/j.cgh.2022.07.012,35870766,#1571,Makaroff 2023,,,1
"Integrating herbal medicine into oncology care delivery: development, implementation, and evaluation of a novel program.",Hou YN; Chimonas S; Gubili J; Deng G; Mao JJ,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of a novel program facilitating patient-provider communication about appropriate use of herbal medicine at a large academic cancer center and its impact on patient wellbeing. METHODS: In the Herbal Oncology Program (HOP), integrative medicine providers counseled patients about unmet symptom needs and prescribed traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbs when indicated, taking into consideration the clinical context, patient preference, and research evidence. To evaluate the feasibility and outcomes, we performed a retrospective analysis using medical record data (symptoms and other concerns that motivated patients to seek herbal products, types and numbers of dispensed TCM herbs, and demographic characteristics). We also conducted a survey to assess patient experience and satisfaction. RESULTS: All 851 participants were outpatients, with 712 (84%) in active treatment. HOP dispensed 1266 herbal prescriptions for a range of symptoms, most commonly GI symptoms (467, 37%); pain (353, 28%); and treatment-related fatigue, sleep, and mood disorders (346, 27%). Of 269 patients invited to the survey, 107 (40%) completed it. A majority of respondents 70.9% (73/103) were satisfied with the effectiveness of dispensed herbs in relieving their symptoms, and few 6.7% (7/104) had experienced mild adverse events that resolved after discontinuing herbal use. CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings support the feasibility of integrating herbal medicine into an academic oncology setting. Patient satisfaction with HOP was high, with limited adverse events. The patterns of herbal prescriptions in HOP suggest future areas for clinical research to strengthen the evidence base around safe and effective use.",2023,Jan,Support Care Cancer,31,2,128,,10.1007/s00520-023-07577-x,36680628,#1581,Hou 2023,,,0
"Patient-reported health-related quality of life outcomes following mastectomy for breast cancer, with immediate, delayed or no breast reconstruction: Four-year follow-up from a prospective cohort study.",Dempsey K; Mathieu E; Brennan M; Snook K; Hoffman J; Campbell I; Scarlet J; Flay H; Wong A; Boyle F; King M; Spillane A,"BACKGROUND: Breast reconstruction (BR) improves women's health-related quality of life (HRQOL) following mastectomy for breast cancer, yet factors contributing to improved HRQOL remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the overall impact of mastectomy with or without BR on participants' perceptions of HRQOL over time in a cohort of women with high-risk breast cancer; to examine differences in mean HRQOL scores between immediate BR, delayed BR and no BR groups; to assess the influence of patient characteristics potentially associated with HRQOL scores; and to determine the feasibility of long-term collection of patient-reported outcome measures in clinical settings. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal study of 100 women with high-risk breast cancer who underwent mastectomy with or without breast reconstruction and were likely to require post-mastectomy radiotherapy. Four validated patient-reported questionnaires, comprising 21 outcome measures relating to HRQOL, administered at baseline and up to 4 years post-mastectomy. Demographic, clinical and surgical data extracted from patient medical records. RESULTS: Consistently significant declines in perceptions of future health and arm symptoms, consistently significant improvements in treatment side effects, breast symptoms and fatigue, as well as significant improvements, compared to baseline, in social functioning and financial difficulties at 48 months. No significant differences in mean HRQOL scores between women given a choice of reconstructive options. CONCLUSION: Similar trajectories of HRQOL scores were found in women with high-risk breast cancer who were offered a choice of BR. Informed choice may be an independent contributing factor in long-term maintenance of most HRQOL indicators at their pre-mastectomy levels.",2023,Oct,Breast,71,,122-131,,10.1016/j.breast.2023.08.001,37573653,#819,Dempsey 2023,,,0
Refusal of Retreatment With Topical 5-Fluorouracil Among Patients With Actinic Keratosis: Qualitative Analysis.,Singh R; McCain S; Feldman SR,"BACKGROUND: Actinic keratosis (AK) is a common premalignant skin lesion, and topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is commonly used in field-directed therapy. However, 5-FU is associated with frequent local skin reactions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to qualitatively assess experiences among patients with AK who refuse retreatment with 5-FU. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 adult participants who had received treatment with 5-FU for AK between January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2020, and refused future treatment with 5-FU. Results were analyzed using qualitative research methods. RESULTS: Although most participants had low concern upon having received a diagnosis of AK, most felt that treatment is very important. When initiating treatment with 5-FU, most cited recommendation by their health care professionals as the primary motivator and initially had low concern regarding treatment. The side effects associated with treatment were physically and psychosocially burdensome for most participants and led to temporary lifestyle adjustments. After treatment, most did not believe that their health care provider prepared them for treatment or were unsure. While half of the participants felt that 5-FU helped treat AKs, half were either unsure, due to premature discontinuation, or did not think that 5-FU treated their AKs. CONCLUSIONS: 5-FU is one of the most commonly prescribed treatments for AKs, yet most patients experienced both a physical and psychosocial burden with the treatment. Inability to assess efficacy due to premature discontinuation secondary to 5-FU-related reactions is common, and shared decision-making, navigating treatment options, and taking into account patient preferences may be critical to help assure better adherence and outcomes. Although our study was limited by input from participants who refused future treatment with 5-FU, most stated that they would still continue to seek treatment for AKs in the future and would consider other topical treatments, especially if associated with a milder tolerability profile.",2023,Feb,JMIR Dermatol,6,,e39988,,10.2196/39988,37632916,#1514,Singh 2023,,,0
When to Consider Coronary Revascularization for Stable Coronary Artery Disease.,Cheng AM; Doll JA,"Revascularization is an effective adjunct to medical therapy for some patients with chronic coronary disease. Despite numerous randomized trials, there remains significant uncertainty regarding if and how to revascularize many patients. Coronary artery bypass grafting is a class I indication for patients with significant left main stenosis or multivessel disease with ejection fraction ≤ 35%. For other patients, clinicians must carefully consider the potential benefits of symptom improvement and reduction of future myocardial infarction or CV death against the risk and cost of revascularization. Although guidelines provide a framework for these decisions, each individual patient will have distinct coronary anatomy, clinical factors, and preferences.",2024,May,Med Clin North Am,108,3,517-538,,10.1016/j.mcna.2023.11.006,38548461,#166,Cheng 2024,,,0
Patient Risk-Benefit Preferences for Transcatheter Versus Surgical Mitral Valve Repair.,Hung A; Yang JC; Wallace M; Zwischenberger BA; Vemulapalli S; Mentz RJ; Thoma E; Goates S; Lewis J; Strong S; Reed SD,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) of mitral regurgitation is less invasive than surgery but has greater 5-year mortality and reintervention risks, and leads to smaller improvements in physical functioning. The study objective was to quantify patient preferences for risk-benefit trade-offs associated with TEER and surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: A discrete choice experiment survey was administered to patients with mitral regurgitation. Attributes included procedure type; 30-day mortality risk; 5-year mortality risk and physical functioning for 5 years; number of hospitalizations in the next 5 years; and risk of additional surgery in the next 5 years. A mixed-logit regression model was fit to estimate preference weights. Two hundred one individuals completed the survey: 63% were female and mean age was 74 years. On average, respondents preferred TEER over surgery. To undergo a less invasive procedure (ie, TEER), respondents would accept up to a 13.3% (95% CI, 8.7%-18.5%) increase in reintervention risk above a baseline of 10%, 4.6 (95% CI, 3.1-6.2) more hospitalizations above a baseline of 1, a 10.7% (95% CI, 6.5%-14.5%) increase in 5-year mortality risk above a baseline of 20%, or more limited physical functioning representing nearly 1 New York Heart Association class (0.7 [95% CI, 0.4-1.1]) over 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in general preferred TEER over surgery. When holding constant all other factors, a functional improvement from New York Heart Association class III to class I maintained over 5 years would be needed, on average, for patients to prefer surgery over TEER.",2024,Mar,J Am Heart Assoc,13,6,e032807,,10.1161/JAHA.123.032807,38471830,#228,Hung 2024,,,1
The Impact of Video-Based Educational Materials with Voiceovers on Preferences for Glucose Monitoring Technology in Patients with Diabetes: A Randomised Study.,Smith IP; Whichello CL; de Bekker-Grob EW; Mölken MPMHR; Veldwijk J; de Wit GA,"INTRODUCTION: Ensuring patients have enough information about healthcare choices prior to completing a preference study is necessary to support the validity of the findings. Patients are commonly informed using text-based information with supporting graphics. Video-based information may be more engaging for the general patient population. This study aimed to assess (1) the impact that educating patients using video-based educational materials with a voiceover has on patient preferences compared to traditional text, and (2) whether this impact is consistent between two countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A video-based educational tool was developed to inform patients prior to completing a discrete choice experiment assessing preferences for glucose monitors. Patients with diabetes from the Netherlands and Poland were recruited through an online research panel. Respondents were randomised to receive information in either a text or a video with animations and a voiceover. Data were analysed using a mixed-logit model. RESULTS: N = 981 completed surveys were analysed from the Netherlands (n = 459) and Poland (n = 522). Differences were found between the countries, but no interpretable pattern of differences was found between the two types of educational materials. Patients spent less time in the educational material than would be necessary to fully review all of the content. CONCLUSIONS: Simply providing educational material in a video with animations and voiceovers does not necessarily lead to better engagement from respondents or different preference outcomes in a sample of diabetes patients when compared to text. Increasing engagement with educational materials should be a topic of future research for those conducting patient preference research as no amount of educational material will be helpful if respondents do not access it.",2023,May,Patient,16,3,223-237,,10.1007/s40271-022-00612-9,36670244,#1292,Smith 2023,,,1
Patient preferences for the treatment of chronic cough: a discrete choice experiment.,Swaminathan AC; Yang JC; Ding H; Grover K; Coles T; Schelfhout J; Johnson FR,"BACKGROUND: Chronic cough is common, negatively affects quality of life and has limited treatment options. Inhibition of purinergic signalling is a promising therapeutic approach but is associated with taste-related adverse effects. Little is known about treatment preferences from the perspective of patients with chronic cough, such as trade-offs between efficacy and side effect. METHODS: Patients with chronic cough completed an online discrete choice experiment survey in which they answered a series of questions requiring a choice between two constructed treatment options characterised by varying attribute levels. Selection of cough and taste-related attributes was informed by qualitative interviews and clinical trial data. Logit-based models were used to analyse resulting choice data. RESULTS: The discrete choice experiment survey was completed by 472 participants with chronic cough. Among study attributes, frequency of intense cough attacks was the most important to participants, followed by taste change, frequency of night-time coughing and frequency of daytime coughing. To accept the least preferred taste disturbance of a bitter, metallic, chalky or oily taste change, participants required either: (1) elimination of night-time cough along with a slight reduction in daytime cough; (2) elimination of daytime cough along with a pronounced reduction in night-time or (3) reduction in intense cough attacks from 7 to 2 times per week. Two distinct preference patterns were identified, each placing different importance on efficacy versus side effect trade-offs. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with chronic cough were willing to accept some taste disturbances in exchange for improved efficacy of chronic cough treatments. Knowledge of patient preferences can facilitate shared decision-making.",2024,Jan,BMJ Open Respir Res,11,1,,,10.1136/bmjresp-2023-001888,38242716,#463,Swaminathan 2024,,,1
A surgical decision aid for occipital neuralgia with literature review and single center case series.,Howard SD; Karsalia R; Ghenbot Y; Qiu L; Pomeraniec IJ; Lee JYK; Zager EL; Cajigas I,"BACKGROUND: Occipital neuralgia (ON) is a debilitating headache disorder. Due to the rarity of this disorder and lack of high-level evidence, a clear framework for choosing the optimal surgical approach for medically refractory ON incorporating shared decision making with patients does not exist. METHODS: A literature review of studies reporting pain outcomes of patients who underwent surgical treatment for ON was performed, as well as a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent surgery for ON within our institution. RESULTS: Thirty-two articles met the inclusion criteria. A majority of the articles were retrospective case series (22/32). The mean number of patients across the studies was 34 (standard deviation (SD) 39). Among the 13 studies that reported change in pain score on 10-point scales, a study of 20 patients who had undergone C2 and/or C3 ganglionectomies reported the greatest reduction in pain intensity after surgery. The studies evaluating percutaneous ablative methods including radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation showed the smallest reduction in pain scores overall. At our institution from 2014 to 2023, 11 patients received surgical treatment for ON with a mean follow-up of 187 days (SD 426). CONCLUSION: Based on these results, the first decision aid for selecting a surgical approach to medically refractory ON is presented. The algorithm prioritizes nerve sparing followed by non-nerve sparing techniques with the incorporation of patient preference. Shared decision making is critical in the treatment of ON given the lack of clear scientific evidence regarding the superiority of a particular surgical method.",2024,Jan,Clin Neurol Neurosurg,236,,108082,,10.1016/j.clineuro.2023.108082,38101258,#507,Howard 2024,,,0
Effective Use of Bromelain and Acetylcysteine (BromAc(®)) for Treatment of Perigastric Pseudomyxoma Peritonei: A Case Report.,Skalkos E; Chen KL; Wijayawardana R; Morris DL,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare clinical condition of progressive peritoneal mucin accumulation. PMP has a reasonable survivability but with a notable risk of tumour recurrence. Standard treatment, including for tumour relapse, aims for a cure with complete cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. In the case of tumour recurrence, surgery becomes progressively complex, and some patients are not suitable for surgery either due to patient preference or morbidity and mortality risk. BromAc(®) is an emerging, novel mucolytic combination therapy composed of bromelain and acetylcysteine which can be administered intratumorally via radiologically guided drains. It represents a minimally invasive treatment for patients who have symptomatic tumour deposits but are not surgical candidates. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 64-year-old male with a background of appendiceal PMP who presented with a gastric outlet obstruction from a perigastric tumour deposit. This was managed with BromAc(®) administration, following which the patient's symptoms resolved. This corresponded with an 80% reduction in the tumour volume radiologically. CONCLUSION: BromAc(®) is an emerging minimally invasive treatment for PMP tumour deposits that may be considered as adjunctive or alternative treatment in patients who are not surgical candidates to reduce tumour burden and improve symptomatology and quality of life.",2023,Oct,Anticancer Res,43,10,4735-4738,,10.21873/anticanres.16670,37772592,#811,Skalkos 2023,,,0
Impact of Opioid Dose Reductions on Patient-Reported Mental Health and Suicide-Related Behavior and Relationship to Patient Choice in Tapering Decisions.,Yarborough BJH; Stumbo SP; Schneider JL; Ahmedani BK; Daida YG; Hooker SA; Negriff S; Rossom RC; Lapham G,"Mental health and suicide-related harms resulting from prescription opioid tapering are poorly documented and understood. Six health systems contributed opioid prescribing data from January 2016 to April 2020. Patients 18 to 70 years old with evidence of opioid tapering participated in semi-structured interviews. Individuals who experienced suicide attempts were oversampled. Family members of suicide decedents who had experienced opioid tapering were also interviewed. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. The study participants included 176 patients and 16 family members. Patients were 68% female, 80% White, and 15% Hispanic, mean age 58. All family members were female spouses of White, non-Hispanic male decedents. Among the subgroup (n = 60) who experienced a documented suicide attempt, reported experiencing suicidal ideation during tapering, or were family members of suicide decedents, 40% reported that opioid tapering exacerbated previously recognized mental health issues, and 25% reported that tapering triggered new-onset mental health concerns. Among participants with suicide behavior, 47% directly attributed it to opioid tapering. Common precipitants included increased pain, reduced life engagement, sleep problems, withdrawal, relationship dissolution, and negative consequences of opioid substitution with other substances for pain relief. Most respondents reporting suicide behavior felt that the decision to taper was made by the health care system or a clinician (67%) whereas patients not reporting suicide behavior were more likely to report it was their own decision (42%). This study describes patient-reported mental health deterioration or suicide behavior while tapering prescription opioids. Clinicians should screen for, monitor, and treat suicide behavior while assisting patients in tapering opioids. PERSPECTIVE: This work describes changes in patient-reported mental health and suicide behavior while tapering prescription opioids. Recommendations for improving care include mental health and suicide risk screening during and following opioid tapering.",2024,Apr,J Pain,25,4,1094-1105,,10.1016/j.jpain.2023.11.002,37952862,#198,YarboroughBJH 2024,,,0
Impact of the Breast Cancer Index for Extended Endocrine Decision-Making: First Results of the Prospective BCI Registry Study.,Sanft TB; Wong J; O'Neal B; Siuliukina N; Jankowitz RC; Pegram MD; Fox JR; Zhang Y; Treuner K; O'Shaughnessy JA,"BACKGROUND: The Breast Cancer Index (BCI) test assay provides an individualized risk of late distant recurrence (5-10 years) and predicts the likelihood of benefitting from extended endocrine therapy (EET) in hormone receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer. This analysis aimed to assess the impact of BCI on EET decision-making in current clinical practice. METHODS: The BCI Registry study evaluates long-term outcomes, decision impact, and medication adherence in patients receiving BCI testing as part of routine clinical care. Physicians and patients completed pre-BCI and post-BCI test questionnaires to assess a range of questions, including physician decision-making and confidence regarding EET; patient preferences and concerns about the cost, side effects, drug safety, and benefit of EET; and patient satisfaction regarding treatment recommendations. Pre-BCI and post-BCI test responses were compared using McNemar's test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: Pre-BCI and post-BCI questionnaires were completed for 843 physicians and 823 patients. The mean age at enrollment was 65 years, and 88.4% of patients were postmenopausal. Of the tumors, 74.7% were T1, 53.4% were grade 2, 76.0% were N0, and 13.8% were HER2-positive. Following BCI testing, physicians changed EET recommendations in 40.1% of patients (P<.0001), and 45.1% of patients changed their preferences for EET (P<.0001). In addition, 38.8% of physicians felt more confident in their recommendation (P<.0001), and 41.4% of patients felt more comfortable with their EET decision (P<.0001). Compared with baseline, significantly more patients were less concerned about the cost (20.9%; P<.0001), drug safety (25.4%; P=.0014), and benefit of EET (29.3%; P=.0002). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis in a large patient cohort of the BCI Registry confirms and extends previous findings on the significant decision-making impact of BCI on EET. Incorporating BCI into clinical practice resulted in changes in physician recommendations, increased physician confidence, improved patient satisfaction, and reduced patient concerns regarding the cost, drug safety, and benefit of EET.",2024,Mar,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,22,2,99-107,,10.6004/jnccn.2023.7087,38437792,#266,Sanft 2024,,,0
Integrating Precision Medicine into Medical Dermatology Clinical Practice: An Expert Consensus Panel.,Zakria D; Brownstone N; Armstrong AW; Boh EE; Koo JYM; Merola JF; Pariser D; Lebwohl M,"BACKGROUND: Precision medicine utilizes an individual&rsquo;s genomics to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. The joint American Academy of Dermatology and National Psoriasis Foundation 2019 guidelines recognized the need to identify biomarkers that can predict the optimal biologic agent for an individual patient. This paper examines the current state of precision medicine in dermatology and how its use can improve outcomes in psoriasis. METHODS: A search of PubMed/MEDLINE using the terms precision medicine, personalized medicine, biomarkers, genomics, and dermatology was performed to identify relevant publications. An expert consensus panel was then convened to assign levels of evidence to each article using strength of recommendation taxonomy and create consensus statements requiring a two-thirds supermajority for agreement utilizing a modified Delphi approach. RESULTS: Thirteen articles met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were assigned levels of evidence. The panel created 10 consensus statements on how precision medicine can improve patient outcomes, all of which received a unanimous (6/6) vote. CONCLUSION: Choosing a biologic medication for psoriasis often relies on patient preference, provider preference, and a trial-and-error approach. Utilizing precision medicine tests such as Mind.Px can help providers identify biomarkers unique to a patient&rsquo;s pathophysiology and choose the optimal medication through a targeted and evidence-based approach.

"Effectiveness, reach, uptake, and feasibility of digital health interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.",Moschonis G; Siopis G; Jung J; Eweka E; Willems R; Kwasnicka D; Asare BY; Kodithuwakku V; Verhaeghe N; Vedanthan R; Annemans L; Oldenburg B; Manios Y,"BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions have shown promising results for the management of type 2 diabetes, but a comparison of the effectiveness and implementation of the different modes is not currently available. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of SMS, smartphone application, and website-based interventions on improving glycaemia in adults with type 2 diabetes and report on their reach, uptake, and feasibility. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo on May 25, 2022, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of digital health interventions in reducing glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) in adults with type 2 diabetes, published in English from Jan 1, 2009. Screening was carried out using Covidence, and data were extracted following Cochrane's guidelines. The primary endpoint assessed was the change in the mean (and 95% CI) plasma concentration of HbA(1c) at 3 months or more. Cochrane risk of bias 2 was used to assess risk of bias. Data on reach, uptake, and feasibility were summarised narratively and data on HbA(1c) reduction were synthesised in a meta-analysis. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria was used to evaluate the level of evidence. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021247845. FINDINGS: Of the 3236 records identified, 56 RCTs from 24 regions (n=11 486 participants), were included in the narrative synthesis, and 26 studies (n=4546 participants) in the meta-analysis. 20 studies used SMS as the primary mode of delivery of the digital health intervention, 25 used smartphone applications, and 11 implemented interventions via websites. Smartphone application interventions reported higher reach compared with SMS and website-based interventions, but website-based interventions reported higher uptake compared with SMS and smartphone application interventions. Effective interventions, in general, included people with greater severity of their condition at baseline (ie, higher HbA(1c)) and administration of a higher dose intensity of the intervention, such as more frequent use of smartphone applications. Overall, digital health intervention group participants had a -0·30 (95% CI -0·42 to -0·19) percentage point greater reduction in HbA(1c), compared with control group participants. The difference in HbA(1c) reduction between groups was statistically significant when interventions were delivered through smartphone applications (-0·42% [-0·63 to -0·20]) and via SMS (-0·37% [-0·57 to -0·17]), but not when delivered via websites (-0·09% [-0·64 to 0·46]). Due to the considerable heterogeneity between included studies, the level of evidence was moderate overall. INTERPRETATION: Smartphone application and SMS interventions, but not website-based interventions, were associated with better glycaemic control. However, the studies' heterogeneity should be recognised. Considering that both smartphone application and SMS interventions are effective for diabetes management, clinicians should consider factors such as reach, uptake, patient preference, and context of the intervention when deciding on the mode of delivery of the intervention. Nine in ten people worldwide own a feature phone and can receive SMS and four in five people have access to a smartphone, with numerous smartphone applications being available for diabetes management. Clinicians should familiarise themselves with this modality of programme delivery and encourage people with type 2 diabetes to use evidence-based applications for improving their self-management of diabetes. Future research needs to describe in detail the mediators and moderators of the effectiveness and implementation of SMS and smartphone application interventions, such as the optimal dose, frequency, timing, user interface, and communication mode to both further improve their effectiveness and to increase their reach, uptake, and feasibility.

"Effectiveness and Safety of Bu Shen Kai Qiao Fang in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: Study Protocol for a Multicenter, Prospective, Real-World Clinical Trial.",Xu Z; Li O; Liang Y; Wu Z; Xu J; Wang L; Li L; Sun Y,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common degenerative disease of the nervous system with serious impact on quality of life of patients and their families. With an aging population, AD has become a major public health problem in China and worldwide. However, the physiological and pathological mechanisms of AD have not been fully elucidated, and there is a lack of effective prevention and clinical treatment methods. Many studies have found that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a good therapeutic effect on cognitive function in AD patients. Bu Shen Kai Qiao Fang (BSKQF) is one such Chinese herbal preparation used in the treatment of AD. We designed a protocol for a real-world clinical study of BSKQF combined with Donepezil hydrochloride (DH) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this approach in the treatment of AD patients. METHODS: This is a protocol for a real-world, multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study. The study will recruit 860 AD patients from four hospitals across China. Equal numbers of patients will be treated with BSKQF and DH or with DH only. The criteria for grouping are based primarily on patient preference. Outcome measures include scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MOCA) and will be recorded at baseline, and at one, two and three months after enrollment. The plasma Aβ42 and plasma Tau levels of participating patients will also be measured by ELISA at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. Safety metrics and adverse events (AEs) of participating patients will be monitored and recorded. DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of BSKQF in the treatment of AD. The results will provide reliable evidence for the clinical application of BSKQF in the treatment of AD. STUDY REGISTRATION: Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, NO.

Community-Engaged Research (CEnR) to Address Gaps in Chronic Kidney Disease Education among Underserved Latines-The CARE Study.,Diaz-Martinez J; Kallus L; Levine HM; Lavernia F; Pierre AJ; Mancilla J; Barthe A; Duran C; Kotzker W; Wagner E; Hospital MM,"Ensuring equitable chronic kidney disease (CKD) education for Latine patients with low health literacy and low English proficiency stands as a critical challenge, and the ""Caridad Awareness and Education"" (CARE) initiative represents our ongoing effort to address this imperative issue. In collaboration with twenty-three patients living with CKD, diabetes and/or hypertension and twelve trained Community Health Workers (CHWs) from diverse Latine subgroups, we conducted a research initiative funded by the National Kidney Foundation. Our primary objective was to co-design and test culturally tailored patient education materials (PEMs) for underserved Latine adults at risk for or diagnosed with CKD. We effectively integrated Community-Engaged Research (CEnR) principles with a Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach to create a range of CKD-PEM prototypes in Spanish. Patient preferences for printed educational materials were clear. They favored printed materials that incorporated visual content with concise text over digital, email, texts, or online resources and personalized phone outreach and the involvement of CHWs. Additionally, patients identified their unwavering commitment to their families as a forceful motivator for caring for their kidney health. Currently, a culturally and linguistically tailored CKD flipchart for one-on-one education, led by CHWs, is undergoing a pilot testing phase involving a sample of one hundred Latine patients at risk for or diagnosed with CKD. This innovative approach signifies a commitment to amplifying the insights and expertise of the Latine community afflicted by kidney health disparities, effectively embracing a CEnR to forge meaningful and impactful CKD-PEMs.",2023,Nov,Int J Environ Res Public Health,20,21,,,10.3390/ijerph20217026,37947582,#694,Diaz-Martinez 2023,,,0
Personalizing prevention: Advances in pharmacotherapy for HIV prevention.,Brizzi M; Sherman EM; Green SB; Nowicki DN; Drwiega EN; Nicol MR; Chastain DB; Sahloff EG; Truong WR; Cluck D; Badowski ME; Michienzi SM; Durham SH,"The HIV epidemic continues to pose a significant burden on the healthcare system. Although the incidence of annual new infections is decreasing, health disparities persist and most new infections remain concentrated into different racial, ethnic, and minority groups. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which involves those at high risk of acquiring HIV to take chronic medications to prevent acquisition of the virus, is key to preventing new HIV infections. The purpose of this article is to review medication therapies for PrEP and examine their role in personalizing PrEP in different patient populations. Additionally, new medications currently under development for PrEP are reviewed, as well as treatment as prevention (TasP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). There are currently four medications available for PrEP: the oral options of co-formulated emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) or emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF); injectable long-acting cabotegravir (CAB-LA); and the vaginal ring dapivirine (DPV-VR). FTC/TAF is not currently indicated for persons at risk for HIV through vaginal sex due to lack of studies, but trials are currently ongoing. DPV-VR is available in Zimbabwe and South Africa and has been endorsed by the World Health Organization but is not currently available in the United States. Several agents are also in development for use in PrEP: the novel long-acting injectable lenacapavir, a first-in-class capsid inhibitor, which has no cross-resistance to any existing HIV drug class; the subdermal implant islatravir, a first-in-class translocation inhibitor; and VRC01, a broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) which has been evaluated in proof-of-concept studies that may lead to the development of more potent bnAbs. Overall, PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV infection in high-risk populations. Identifying optimal PrEP regimens in different patient populations is complex and must consider patient-specific factors and medication cost and access considerations. Lastly, providers should consider individual patient preferences with regard to prevention to improve access, retention in care, and adherence.",2023,Apr,Pharmacotherapy,43,4,305-320,,10.1002/phar.2796,36938645,#1351,Brizzi 2023,,,0
Mechanical Thrombectomy for Acute and Subacute Blocked Arteries and Veins in the Lower Limbs: A Health Technology Assessment.,,"BACKGROUND: A blockage to the blood vessels in the lower extremities may cause pain and discomfort. If left unmanaged, it may lead to amputation or chronic disability, such as in the form of post-thrombotic syndrome. We conducted a health technology assessment of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) devices, which are proposed to remove a blood clot, which may form in the arteries or veins of the lower legs. This evaluation considered blockages in the veins and arteries separately, and included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding MT for lower limb blockages, patient preferences and values, and clinical and health system stakeholders' perspectives. METHOD: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Cochrane tool for randomized controlled trials or the risk of bias among non-randomized studies (RoBANS) tool for nonrandomized studies, and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature search. We did not conduct a primary economic evaluation since the clinical evidence is highly uncertain. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding MT treatment for inpatients with arterial acute limb ischemia and acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower limb in Ontario. To contextualize the potential value of MT, we spoke with people with acute DVT. To understand the barriers and facilitators of accessing MT, we surveyed clinical and health system stakeholders to gain their perspectives. RESULTS: We included 40 studies (3 randomized controlled trials and 37 observational studies) in the clinical evidence review. For patients who experience arterial acute limb ischemia, compared with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) alone, MT has greater technical success and patency and reduced hospital length of stay, but the evidence for these outcomes is uncertain (GRADE: Very low). Mechanical thrombectomy may reduce the volume of thrombolytic medication required and CDT infusion time (a determinant for intensive care unit [ICU] need) in patients experiencing acute DVT, but it is uncertain if this is to a meaningful degree (GRADE: Moderate to Very low). It may also reduce the proportion of people who experience post-thrombotic syndrome and overall hospital length of stay, but it is uncertain (GRADE: Very low).We estimated that publicly funding MT for people with arterial acute limb ischemia in Ontario would lead to an annual cost savings of $0.17 million in year 1 to $0.14 million in year 5, for a total savings of $0.83 million over 5 years. This cost savings was mainly attributed to reduced ICU stays among people who received MT, but the results had considerable uncertainty. For the population with acute DVT, publicly funding MT would lead to an additional cost of $0.77 million in year 1 to $1.44 million in year 5, for a total additional cost of $5.5 million over 5 years.The people with acute DVT with whom we spoke reported that MT was generally seen as a positive option, and those who had undergone the procedure reported positively on its value as a treatment to quickly remove a clot. Accessing treatment for DVT could be a barrier, especially in more remote areas of Ontario.Clinicians using the technology advised that facilitators to accessing the technology included perceived improvements in patient outcomes, resourcing requirements, addressing unmet needs, and avoidance of ICU stay. The main barrier identified was cost. Clinicians who were not using the technology advised that barriers were low case-use volume, along with costs for the equipment and for health human resources. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy may have greater technical success and patency and reduce hospital length of stay for patients experiencing an arterial acute limb ischemia and, for patients with an acute DVT, it may reduce CDT volume and infusion time, the proportion of people who experience post-thrombotic syndrome, and hospital length of stay. Mechanical thrombectomy may reduce the associated ICU costs, but it has higher equipment costs compared with usual care. Publicly funding MT in Ontario for populations with arterial acute limb ischemia may not lead to a substantial budget increase to the province. Publicly funding MT for acute DVT would lead to an additional cost of $5.5 million over 5 years. For people with acute DVT, MT was seen as a potential positive treatment option to remove the clot quickly. Overall, the majority of clinical stakeholders we engaged with (including both those with and without experience with MT) were supportive of the use of the technology.",2023,,Ont Health Technol Assess Ser,23,1,1-244,,,36818453,#1578,,,,0
Retreatment rates and postprocedural complications are higher than expected after BPH surgeries: a US healthcare claims and utilization study.,Kaplan S; Kaufman RP Jr; Mueller T; Elterman D; Chughtai B; Rukstalis D; Woo H; Roehrborn C,"BACKGROUND: Up to 50% of men over 50 and 80% over 80 are affected by BPH. Shared decision-making regarding BPH treatment options can benefit from an improved understanding of relative risks and benefits for various treatments. METHODS: Data for this longitudinal retrospective population-based cohort study were obtained from a random sample of US Medicare and commercial claims (IBM Watson MarketScan) and restricted to men undergoing BPH surgery (TURP, PVP, PUL, WVTT) from 2015 to 2021 across all sites of service. Retreatments included Holmium laser enucleation and index procedures. Main outcomes were rates of retreatment and procedural complications over 1 year, identified via CPT and ICD-9/10CM codes. Procedural complications that occurred at least 1 day post-index treatment were assessed, as were surgical retreatments with patients who had at least 1 and 5 year's-worth of data. Baseline phenotype characterization did not control for symptomatology and was limited to age, comorbidities, and BMI. Univariate cumulative incidence estimates, cumulative proportion and log-rank tests justified inclusion for covariate (e.g., age, comorbidities) adjustment in Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: 43,147 men diagnosed with BPH underwent 22,629 TURP, 11,392 PVP, 7,529 PUL, and 1,597 WVTT. At 1-year post-index: PUL was associated with the lowest rate of complication (PUL 15%, TURP 17%; PVP 19%, ; WVTT 26%); retreatment rates were not different (TURP 5.3%, PVP 5.3%, PUL 5.9%, WVTT 6.2%). At 5 years post-index: retreatment was lowest for TURP (7.0%) and was not significantly different between PVP and PUL (8.9% and 11.6%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Real-world patients diagnosed with BPH may be selected to undergo one of the various available therapies based on patient preference or baseline phenotype. These therapies, however, are associated with different risks for complications. The results of this study suggest that within one year of BPH surgery, one-in-twenty patients may require retreatment regardless of treatment choice, and for some technologies as many as one-in-four may require treatment for a complication.",2023,Oct,Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis,,,,,10.1038/s41391-023-00741-8,37884615,#763,Kaplan 2023,,,0
[Geographical access to hemodialysis: an analysis of patient choices].,Devictor B; Crémades A; Izaaryene G; Mazoue F; Brunet P; Gentile S,"INTRODUCTION: Patients do not always go to the facility closest to their home. DESCRIPTION: A study was carried out in Provence-Alpes Côtes d'Azur (PACA) on patients' preferences to mobilize the hemodialysis offer. METHODS: The data were extracted from the REIN Registry. Potential access was compared with actual access. A survey was carried out among a sample of patients travelling an additional distance of more than 25 km. RESULTS: About a quarter of the patients did not travel to the nearest facility. Of these, 16.3% travelled an additional distance of over 25 km. Patients' choices were determined by the relationship of trust with the team that first set up dialysis, followed by their desire to be followed in a multi-purpose facility. DISCUSSION: While distance remained the decisive factor, human factors were cited in the majority of cases to explain the bypass. CONCLUSION: The links between the first team and the next one should be strengthened.",2024,Feb,Nephrol Ther,20,1,17-29,,10.1684/ndt.2024.59,38294262,#335,Devictor 2024,,,0
Predictors of Informed People's Preferences for Statin Therapy to Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Risk: an Internet Survey Study.,Valentine KD; Brodney S; Sepucha K; Barry MJ,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines suggest clinicians inform patients about their 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; however, little is known about how the risk estimate influences patients' preferences for statin therapy for primary prevention. OBJECTIVE: To define predictors of preference for statin therapy after participants were informed about their individualized benefits and harms. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey in 2020. SETTING: Online US survey panel. PARTICIPANTS: A national sample of 304 respondents aged 40 to 75 who had not previously taken a statin and who knew their cholesterol levels and blood pressure measurements. INTERVENTION: Participants entered their risk factors into a calculator which estimated their 10-year CVD risk. They were then provided with an estimate of their absolute risk reduction with a statin and the chance of side effects from meta-analyses. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: We used a hierarchical model to predict participants' preferences for statin therapy according to their 10-year CVD risk, perceptions of the magnitude of statin benefit (large, medium, small, or almost no benefit), worry about side effects (very worried, somewhat worried, a little worried, not worried at all), and other variables. KEY RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 55 years (SD = 9.9); 50% were female, 44% were non-white, and 16% had a high school degree or less education. After reviewing their benefits and side effects, 45% of the participants reported they probably or definitely wanted to take a statin. In the full hierarchical model, only perceived benefits of taking a statin was a significant independent predictor of wanting a statin (OR 7.3, 95% CI 4.7, 12.2). LIMITATIONS: Participants were from an internet survey panel and making hypothetical decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Participants' perceptions of their benefit from statin therapy predicted wanting to take a statin for primary prevention; neither estimated CVD risk nor worries about statin side effects were independent predictors.",2023,Jan,J Gen Intern Med,38,1,36-41,,10.1007/s11606-022-07440-5,35230620,#1678,Valentine 2023,,,0
Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to personalise follow-up care of ovarian cancer: what do patients think? A qualitative interview study.,Seeratan DD; van Schuylenburch RG; van Lonkhuijzen LRCW; Aarts JWM,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore ovarian cancer patients' preferences regarding follow-up care and, in particular, the use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) as an approach to personalise follow-up care. METHODS: Between May and June 2021, semi-structured interviews were conducted with ovarian cancer patients, who had finished their primary treatment at least 6 months prior and were receiving follow-up care at our centre. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using an inductive thematic approach. A thematic flow chart was created describing interacting themes. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were interviewed, of which 11 were familiar with PROMs. Two key themes emerged from the data: the need for reassurance and the wish for personalised care. A follow-up scheme using PROMs was identified as a separate theme with the potential to personalise care. Several barriers and facilitators of PROMs were mentioned. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian cancer patients have a desire for personalised follow-up care and seek reassurance. PROMs may be able to support both of these needs. Future research is needed to determine the most effective, patient-centred way to implement them. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: By understanding what patients' preferences are regarding follow-up care, more initiatives can be set up to personalise follow-up care, through which patient anxiety and dissatisfaction can be reduced.",2024,Mar,Support Care Cancer,32,4,247,,10.1007/s00520-024-08436-z,38528152,#209,Seeratan 2024,,,0
Current Health State Affected Patient Preferences More Than Disease Status: A Discrete Choice Experiment in Multiple Myeloma.,Tervonen T; Duenas A; Collacott H; Lam A; Gries KS; Carson R; Trevor N; Krucien N; He J,"OBJECTIVES: To examine how disease status and current health state influence treatment preferences of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). METHODS: Participants with MM from France, Germany, and the United Kingdom completed a web-based survey that included a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and EQ-5D assessment. The DCE elicited preferences for 8 attributes: increased life expectancy, increased time to relapse, pain, fatigue, risk of infection, administration (route and duration), frequency of administration, and monitoring. Multinomial logit models were used to analyze DCE preference data and to calculate life expectancy trade-offs. RESULTS: Three hundred participants with MM (newly diagnosed, transplant eligible, n = 108; newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible, n = 105; relapsed-refractory, n = 87) completed the survey. The most valued attributes were pain, fatigue, and increased life expectancy. Participants would want an additional 2.7 years of life expectancy (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4-3.1 years) to tolerate extreme pain and an additional 2.0 years of life expectancy (95% CI 1.6-2.3 years) to tolerate constant fatigue. Participants in a better health state (third EQ-5D score quartile [0.897]) required less additional life expectancy than participants with a worse health state (first EQ-5D score quartile [0.662]) to tolerate extreme pain (2.3 years [95% CI 1.9-2.6 years] vs 3.0 years [95% CI 2.6-3.4 years]; P = .007). There was little difference in treatment preferences between newly diagnosed and relapsed-refractory patients for pain, fatigue, and increased life expectancy. CONCLUSIONS: Current health state influenced treatment preferences of patients with MM more than disease status and should be considered when making treatment decisions.",2023,Jun,Value Health,26,6,909-917,,10.1016/j.jval.2023.01.016,36738785,#1210,Tervonen 2023,,,1
Ultrasound-Guided Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block.,Pepe J; Ausman C; Madhani NB,"Pain management is an integral part of providing care in the emergency setting. Lower extremity pain from hip fractures, burns, and other trauma is a common presenting complaint. Unfortunately, pain management can be difficult due to medication side effects, patient preferences, and other patient characteristics that can make intravenous analgesia less desirable. Opioid medications can be associated with respiratory depression, hypotension, mental status changes, and vomiting. NSAIDs can increase bleeding risk and exacerbate underlying gastrointestinal (GI) problems. Acetaminophen alone is often not sufficient for severe pain. Hip fractures, in particular, can cause considerable pain, and often occur in elderly adults with multiple comorbidities which make analgesia challenging. A fascia iliaca compartment block can provide superior analgesia with minimal side effects. It can be deployed in a relatively quick fashion after a small amount of training and can be executed with high success rates under ultrasound guidance. In a study by Monzon et al., patients who received a fascia iliaca compartment block for a hip fracture had significantly reduced pain levels. The pain was initially rated at an average of 8.5 on a 10 point scale but decreased to an average of 2.3 at 2 hours post-injection. In a study by Stevens et al., in Anesthesia Intensive Care, patients who underwent a fascia iliaca compartment block used significantly less morphine over the course of 24 hours than the control group which used morphine alone. An additional advantage is the duration of effect, which has been seen for 8 to 10 hours following a single shot block. Another randomized placebo-controlled trial showed that pain relief was superior at all time points measured in the fascia iliac compartment block group as compared with a group utilizing morphine only. In fact, median total morphine consumption in the compartment block group was 0 mg due to excellent analgesia after only a compartment block. Similar results were seen in a study by Lopez et al. for femoral shaft fractures. Emergency department-specific studies using ultrasound guidance have shown 76% mean reduction of pain score in patients with hip fracture at 120 minutes.",2024,Jan,,,,,,,30085515,#545,Pepe 2024,,,0
Orthodontic Aligners: Current Perspectives for the Modern Orthodontic Office.,Kau CH; Soh J; Christou T; Mangal A,"Orthodontic aligners are changing the practice of orthodontics. This system of orthodontic appliances is becoming the mainstay appliance of choice for orthodontic offices in many countries. Patient preferences and lifestyle needs have made this appliance the primary choice when seeking care. In the early days, appliances lacked the efficiency and effectiveness of traditional bracket-wire systems, but modern systems are now able to handle a more comprehensive orthodontic caseload. Current systems provide newer biomechanical strategies and artificial intelligence-driven tooth movements for better outcomes. These improvements now mean that an orthodontist can be better prepared to manage a larger number of orthodontic malocclusions. This paper aims to discuss some of the evolution of orthodontic aligners and to describe to orthodontists the fundamentals of aligner therapy.

Remote vs in-person BRCA1/2 non-carriers test disclosure: patients' choice during Covid-19 pandemic restriction.,Costanzo S; De Summa S; Maurmo L; Digennaro M; Patruno M; Paradiso A,"During Covid-19 pandemic most hospitals have restricted in-person delivery of non-essential healthcare services, including genetic testing delivery, to slow the spread of the virus. Our Onco-Genetic Service also faced this challenging period and had to re-organize its clinical practice with the use of tele-health. Aim of the present paper is to understand whether and how Covid-19-related changes in medical practice influenced patients' satisfaction about the health service provided. 125 BRCA1/2 non carriers (109/125, 87.2% female and 16/125, 12.8% male) in Istituto Tumori ""Giovanni Paolo II"" of Bari were enrolled. All participants were asked to choose whether they prefer in-person or remote post-test counselling session. Basing on patients' choice, two groups of subjects were composed. One week after the post-test counselling session, participants were phone called and asked to complete: a socio-demographic form, a brief structured interview about their Covid-19 related worries and their satisfaction with the health service provided, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Fear of Covid-19 scale. Qualitative information about patients' choice were also collected. No significant difference about patients' satisfaction with the health service provided emerged between groups. Patients who preferred remote post-test counselling had higher anxiety, worries and fear-of Covid-19 than the others. All remote-counselling subjects preferred tele-genetics because of Covid-19 security, would choose it again and would recommend it to others. Cancer tele-genetics offers good guarantees of comfort and efficacy, but patients' choices are related to personal and psychological variables.

Comparison of the effectiveness of local anesthesia for the digital block between single-volar subcutaneous and double-dorsal finger injections: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials.,Lee CH; Lin MH; Lin YT; Hsu CC; Lin CH; Chen SH; Huang RW,"Local anesthesia is an effective method to perform digital nerve blocks. In this study, we compare the effectiveness of single-volar subcutaneous and double-dorsal injection through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to 7 April 2021 was performed. RCTs with the effects of single-volar subcutaneous and double-dorsal injection were eligible. Meta-analysis was performed using random effect models with pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RoB 2.0 and GRADE of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria were applied for evaluating the bias. A total of 2484 studies were initially identified, with 11 eligible RCTs finally included in the meta-analysis (1363 patients). The pooled data of nine studies showed single-volar injection had a statistically significantly lower pain score (pooled SMD: 0.20, 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.39, p = 0.041, I2 = 58%, N = 1187) and higher patient preference but invalid anesthesia at the dorsal proximal digit. No significant differences were observed in the onset of anesthesia, adjacent digit invalid numbness, distal phalanx invalid anesthesia, additional injection rate, and adverse effects. In conclusion, this meta-analysis of RCTs showed that the single-volar injection was associated with a lower pain sensation during injection and higher patient satisfaction with a reduced anesthetic effect over the proximal dorsal phalanx.

Trajectories of primary health care utilization: a 10-year follow-up after the Swedish Patient Choice Reform of primary health care.,Kohnke H; Zielinski A; Beckman A; Ohlsson H,"BACKGROUND: In January 2010, the choice reform was instituted in Swedish primary health care establishing free entry for private primary health care providers and enabling patients to choose freely among primary health care centers. The motivation behind the reform was to improve access to primary care and responsiveness to patient expectations. Reform effects on health care utilization have previously been investigated by using subgroup analyses assuming a pattern of homogeneous subgroups of the population. By using a different methodological approach, the aim of this study was to, from an equity perspective, investigate long term trends of primary health care utilization following the choice reform. METHOD: A closed cohort was created based on register data from Region Skåne, the third most populated region in Sweden, describing individuals' health care utilization between 2007-2017. Using a novel approach, utilization data, measured as primary health care visits, was matched with socioeconomic and geographic determinants, and analyzed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 659,298 individuals were included in the cohort. Sex differences in utilization were recorded to decrease in the older age group and to increase in the younger age group. Multivariable logistic regression showed increasing utilization in older men to be associated with higher socioeconomic position, while in women it was associated with lower socioeconomic position. Furthermore, groups of becoming high utilizers were all associated with lower socioeconomic position and with residence in urban areas. CONCLUSION: The impact of demographic, socioeconomic and geographic determinants on primary health care utilization varies in magnitude and direction between groups of the population. As a result, the increase in utilization as observed in the general population following the choice reform is unevenly distributed between different population groups.",2023,Nov,BMC Health Serv Res,23,1,1294,,10.1186/s12913-023-10326-9,37996861,#666,Kohnke 2023,,,0
Patterns of Health Care Access and Use in an Urban American Indian and Alaska Native Population.,Garcia AN; Venegas-Murrillo A; Martinez-Hollingsworth A; Smith LV; Wells K; Heilemann MV; Fischbach L; Cummings PL; Kuo T,"Studies of health care access and use among historically resilient populations, while common, often field a limited sample size and rarely ask the groups most impacted by health inequities to weigh in. This is especially so for research and programs that focus on the American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) population. The present study addresses this gap by examining data from a cross-sectional survey of AIANs in Los Angeles County. To better interpret project findings and generate culturally relevant contexts, qualitative feedback was gathered at a community forum held in Spring 2018. Because recruitment of AIANs has historically been challenging, purposive sampling was employed to strategically identify a larger eligible pool. Among those who were eligible, 94% completed the survey (n = 496). AIANs who were enrolled in a tribe were 32% more likely to use the Indian Health Service (IHS), compared with those who were not enrolled (95% CI: 20.4%, 43.2%; p < .0001). In multivariable modeling, the strongest factors influencing IHS access and use were: tribal enrollment, preference for culturally-specific health care, proximity of the services to home or work, having Medicaid, and having less than a high school education. Feedback from the community forum indicated cost and trust (of a provider) were important considerations for most AIANs. Study findings reveal heterogeneous patterns of health care access and use in this population, suggesting a need to further improve the continuity, stability, and the image of AIANs' usual sources of care (e.g., IHS, community clinics).",2023,May,J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,,,1-11,,10.1007/s40615-023-01624-3,37202652,#1231,Garcia 2023,,,0

Persistent obstructive sleep apnoea in children: treatment options and management considerations.,Ersu R; Chen ML; Ehsan Z; Ishman SL; Redline S; Narang I,"Unresolved obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) after an adenotonsillectomy, henceforth referred to as persistent OSA, is increasingly recognised in children (2-18 years). Although associated with obesity, underlying medical complexity, and craniofacial disorders, persistent OSA also occurs in otherwise healthy children. Inadequate treatment of persistent OSA can lead to long-term adverse health outcomes beyond childhood. Positive airway pressure, used as a one-size-fits-all primary management strategy for persistent childhood OSA, is highly efficacious but has unacceptably low adherence rates. A pressing need exists for a broader, more effective management approach for persistent OSA in children. In this Personal View, we discuss the use and the need for evaluation of current and novel therapeutics, the role of shared decision-making models that consider patient preferences, and the importance of considering the social determinants of health in research and clinical practice. A multipronged, comprehensive approach to persistent OSA might achieve better clinical outcomes in childhood and promote health equity for all children.",2023,Mar,Lancet Respir Med,11,3,283-296,,10.1016/S2213-2600(22)00262-4,36162413,#1488,Ersu 2023,,,0
Patient perspectives on risk-reducing salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy for ovarian cancer risk-reduction: A systematic review of the literature.,Perez L; Webster E; Bull L; Brewer JT; Ahsan MD; Lin J; Levi SR; Cantillo E; Chapman-Davis E; Holcomb K; Rosenberg SM; Frey MK,"OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence suggests the fallopian tube as the site of origin of BRCA1/2-associated high-grade ovarian cancers. Several ongoing trials are evaluating salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy (RRSDO) for ovarian cancer risk reduction and patients are beginning to ask their clinicians about this surgical option. This study sought to systematically review the available literature examining patient preferences regarding RRSDO and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) to provide clinicians with an understanding of patient values, concerns, and priorities surrounding ovarian cancer risk-reducing surgery. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PROSPERO No.: CRD42023400690). We searched key electronic databases to identify studies evaluating acceptance and surgical decision-making regarding RRSO and RRSDO among patients with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. RESULTS: The search yielded 239 results, among which six publications met the systematic review inclusion criteria. Acceptance of RRSDO was evaluated in all studies and ranged from 34% to 71%. Factors positively impacting patients' acceptance of RRSDO included: avoidance of surgical menopause, preservation of fertility, concerns about sexual dysfunction, family history of breast cancer, and avoidance of hormone replacement therapy. Factors limiting this acceptance reported by patients included concerns regarding oncologic safety, surgical timing, and surgical complications. CONCLUSION: To date, few studies have explored patient perspectives surrounding RRSDO. Collectively, the limited data available indicate a high level of acceptance among BRCA1/2 carriers, and provides insight regarding both facilitating and limiting factors associated with patient preferences to better equip clinicians in the counseling and support of their patients.",2023,Jun,Gynecol Oncol,173,,106-113,,10.1016/j.ygyno.2023.04.006,37116391,#1196,Perez 2023,Ileana Baldi (2024-09-26 02:56:31)(Select): Includes qualitative studies; ,,1
Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Statement: Clinical considerations for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants.,Joseph NT; Kuller JA; Louis JM; Hughes BL,"Respiratory syncytial virus is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract illness globally in children aged <5 years. Each year, approximately 58,000 hospitalizations in the United States are attributed to respiratory syncytial virus. Infants aged ≤6 months experience the most severe morbidity and mortality. Until recently, prevention with the monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, was only offered to infants with high-risk conditions, and treatment primarily consisted of supportive care. Currently, 2 products are approved for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus in infants. These include the Pfizer bivalent recombinant respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein subunit vaccine, administered seasonally to the pregnant person between 32 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation, and the monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab, administered to infants aged up to 8 months entering their first respiratory syncytial virus season. With few exceptions, administering both the vaccine to the pregnant person and the monoclonal antibody to the infant is not recommended. All infants should be protected against respiratory syncytial virus using one of these strategies. Key considerations for pregnant individuals include examining available safety and efficacy data, weighing accessibility and availability, and patient preferences for maternal vaccination vs infant monoclonal antibody treatment. It will be critical for maternal-fetal medicine physicians to provide effective and balanced counseling to aid patients in deciding on a personalized approach to the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus in their infants.",2024,Feb,Am J Obstet Gynecol,230,2,B41-B49,,10.1016/j.ajog.2023.10.046,37914061,#430,Joseph 2024,,,0
Comparing adalimumab and infliximab in the prevention of postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Gangwani MK; Nawras M; Aziz M; Rani A; Priyanka F; Dahiya DS; Ahmed Z; Sohail AH; Karna R; Lee-Smith W; Kamal F; Kobeissy A; Alastal Y,"BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a relapsing disease that often requires operative management. Prevention of postoperative recurrence (POR) is critical to maintain remissions. Biologic agents have proven to be most successful in remission maintenance. We made a direct head-to-head comparison of the 2 anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA), to compare endoscopic and clinical POR of Crohn's disease. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search in 7 databases, including Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science Core Collection, KCI-Korean Journal Index, SciELO, and Global Index Medicus. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and P-values (<0.05 considered significant). We evaluated the total rates of endoscopic recurrence, endoscopic recurrence at 1 year, and clinical recurrence rates of IFX and ADA in a direct head-to-head comparison. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded a total of 393 articles. Three studies with a total of 268 participants were included. Our meta-analysis showed no statistically significant difference in total endoscopic recurrence rate between ADA and IFX (27.1% vs. 32.3%, OR 0.696, 95%CI 0.403-1.201; P=0.193; I (2)=0%). Nor was there any significant difference between the drugs in endoscopic recurrence rate at 1 year (OR 0.799, 95%CI 0.329-1.940; P=0.620) or clinical recurrence rate (OR 0.477, 95%CI 0.477-1.712; P=0.755). CONCLUSIONS: ADA and IFX show comparable efficacy in preventing POR endoscopically and clinically. The clinical decision should be based on cost, side-effects, tolerability, and patient preferences.

Etanercept is Effective and Halts Radiographic Progression in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Final Results from a German Non-interventional Study (PRERA).,Wassenberg S; Rau R; Klopsch T; Plenske A; Jobst J; Klaus P; Meng T; Löschmann PA,"INTRODUCTION: Etanercept (ETN) has been shown to slow radiographic progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in clinical trials. This real-world, non-interventional study assessed radiographic progression in patients with RA or PsA treated with ETN for ≤ 36 months in outpatient care in Germany (NCT01623752). METHODS: Patients with RA or PsA attended ≤ 10 visits across two study phases (phase 1: seven visits, baseline to month 18; phase 2: three visits until month 36). Radiographs were taken at baseline (Rx1), months 12-18 (Rx2), and/or months 30-36 (Rx3). Historic radiographs (Rx0) taken 12-48 months pre-baseline were also evaluated (if available). The primary endpoint was the change in modified total Sharp score (mTSS). The erosion score (ES) and joint space narrowing score (JSN) were also evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 1821 patients were enrolled (RA: n = 1378; PsA: n = 440). In patients with Rx1 and Rx2 (RA: n = 511; PsA: n = 167), the mean mTSS remained stable for both disease groups, and the annualized median change in mTSS was 0. In patients with Rx0, Rx1, and Rx2 (RA: n = 180; PsA: n = 47), annualized radiographic progression in mTSS, ES, and JSN was larger in the pre-ETN treatment phase than during ETN treatment in both disease groups. The percentage of patients with radiographic non-progression was higher during ETN treatment versus pre-ETN. Improvement in clinical disease activity and patient-reported outcomes was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first real-world, non-interventional study to report systematically collected radiographic data in a large cohort of patients with RA or PsA under treatment with a biologic. In patients with available radiographic data, mean radiographic progression was lower and the proportion of patients without progression was greater during ETN treatment than in the pre-ETN period.",2023,Feb,Rheumatol Ther,10,1,117-133,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01623752,10.1007/s40744-022-00491-4,36251174,#1564,Wassenberg 2023,,,0
The Effects of Patient Characteristics on the Management of Subclinical Hypothyroidism: A Survey of Faculty and Trainees.,Jiang C; Wolf K; Kaakati R; Oh J; Yip AT; Jonklaas J; Bianco AC; Laiteerapong N; Ettleson MD,"OBJECTIVE: There is no universal approach to the management of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). This study was designed to determine the impact of patient characteristics on management decisions in SCH amongst physician faculty members and trainees. METHODS: An online survey was distributed to faculty members and medical trainees (ie, interns, residents, and fellows) at multiple academic medical centers. The survey included 9 clinical scenarios describing women with SCH with 5 management options sequenced from most ""conservative"" (no further treatment or monitoring) to most ""aggressive"" (treatment with levothyroxine). RESULTS: Of the 194 survey respondents, 95 (49.0%) were faculty members and 99 (51.0%) were trainees. Faculty members were more likely to report being ""confident"" or ""very confident"" in making the diagnosis of SCH compared to trainees (95.8% vs 46.5%, P < .001). Faculty members were also more likely to consider patient preference for treatment (60.0% vs 32.3%, P < .001). Among all respondents, the clinical factors that resulted in the highest predicted probability of treatment were hypothyroid symptoms (predicted probability [PP] 68.8%, 95% CI [65.7%-71.9%]), thyroid stimulating hormone >10 mIU/L in a 31-year-old (PP 63.9%, 95% CI [60.3%-67.3%]), and the desire for fertility (PP 52.2%, 95% CI [48.6%-56.0%]). In general, faculty members favored more aggressive treatment across all clinical scenarios. CONCLUSION: The presence of symptoms, thyroid stimulating hormone >10 mIU/L, and desire for fertility were most predictive of the decision to treat in SCH. In several clinical scenarios, both trainee and faculty decision-making demonstrated discordance with general SCH management principles.",2023,Oct,Endocr Pract,29,10,787-793,,10.1016/j.eprac.2023.07.031,37549880,#820,Jiang 2023,,,0
Physician awareness of patients' preferred level of involvement in decision-making at the initial urogynecology visit: a randomized trial.,Nwachokor J; Rochlin EK; Gevelinger M; Yadav M; Adams W; Fitzgerald C; Acevedo-Alvarez M; Mueller ER; Pham TT,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown up to a 40% discordance between patients' preferred roles in decision-making before and their perceived roles after their visit. This can negatively affect patients' experiences; interventions to minimize this discordance may significantly improve patient satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether physicians' awareness of patients' preferred involvement in decision-making before their initial urogynecology visit affects patients' perceived level of involvement after their visit. STUDY DESIGN: This randomized controlled trial enrolled adult English-speaking women presenting for their initial visit at an academic urogynecology clinic from June 2022 to September 2022. Before the visit, participants completed the Control Preference Scale to determine the patient's preferred level of decision-making: active, collaborative, or passive. The participants were randomized to either the physician team being aware of their decision-making preference before the visit or usual care. The participants were blinded. After the visit, participants again completed a Control Preference Scale and the Patient Global Impression of Improvement, CollaboRATE, patient satisfaction, and health literacy questionnaires. Fisher exact, logistic regression, and generalized estimating equations were used. Based on a 21% difference in preferred and perceived discordance, we calculated the sample size to be 50 patients in each arm to achieve 80% power. RESULTS: Women (n=100) with a mean age of 52.9 years (standard deviation=15.8) participated in the study. Most participants identified as White (73%) and non-Hispanic (70%). Before the visit, most women preferred an active role (61%) and few preferred a passive role (7%). There was no significant difference between the 2 cohorts in the discordance between their pre- and post-Control Preference Scale responses (27% vs 37%; P=.39) or whether their symptoms were much better or very much better following the visit (18% vs 37%; P=.06). However, when asked whether they were completely satisfied with the visit, those assigned to the physician awareness cohort reported higher satisfaction than those in the treatment as usual cohort (100% vs 90%; P=.03). CONCLUSION: Although there was no significant decrease in discordance between the patient's desired and perceived level of decision-making following physician awareness, it had a significant effect on patient satisfaction. All patients whose physicians were aware of their preferences reported complete satisfaction with their visit. Although patient-centered care does not always entail meeting all of the patients' expectations, the mere understanding of their preferences in decision-making can lead to complete patient satisfaction.",2024,Jan,Am J Obstet Gynecol,230,1,81.e1-81.e9,,10.1016/j.ajog.2023.06.024,37330125,#534,Nwachokor 2024,,,0
Patient Preferences in the Management of Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Results of a Multinational Discrete Choice Experiment in Europe.,Willems D; Hinzpeter EL; Van der Zee HH; Sayed CJ; Ingram JR; Beaudart C; Evers SMAA; Hiligsmann M,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can lead to a substantial reduction in quality of life. Recent studies revealed high levels of unmet care needs of patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, but their preferences in treatment decision making have scarcely been investigated. This study aimed to reveal which treatment attributes adult patients with HS in Europe consider most important in treatment decision-making. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was conducted with adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa in Europe to reveal which treatment attributes are most important when making treatment decisions. Participants were presented with 15 sets of two treatment options and asked for each to choose the treatment they preferred. The treatments were characterized by six attributes informed by a prior literature review and qualitative research: effectiveness, pain reduction, duration of treatment benefit, risk of mild adverse event, risk of serious infection, and mode of administration. A random parameter logit model was used to estimate patients' preferences with additional subgroup and latent class models used to explore any differences in preferences across patient groups. RESULTS: Two hundred and nineteen adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa were included in the analysis (90% women, mean age 38 years). For all six treatment attributes, significant differences were observed between levels. Given the range of levels of each attribute, the most important treatment attributes were effectiveness (47.9%), followed by pain reduction (17.3%), annual risk of a mild adverse event (14.4%), annual risk of a serious infection (10.3%), mode of administration (5.3%), and duration of treatment benefit (4.8%). Higher levels of effectiveness, namely a 75% or 100% reduction in the abscess and inflammatory nodule count, were preferred over levels of effectiveness primarily investigated in randomized clinical trials of hidradenitis suppurativa (a 50% reduction). Results were largely consistent across subgroups and three latent class groups were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the most important treatment characteristics for patients with hidradenitis suppurativa that can help inform joint patient-physician decision making in the management of hidradenitis suppurativa. Designing future hidradenitis suppurativa treatments according to stated preferences, namely, to offer higher levels of effectiveness and pain improvement without higher risks of adverse events, may increase patients' treatment concordance and lead to improved disease management outcomes.",2023,Mar,Patient,16,2,153-164,,10.1007/s40271-022-00614-7,36630078,#1458,Willems 2023,,,1
"Racial, Ethnic, and Socioeconomic Disparities in Out-of-Hospital Pain Management for Patients With Long Bone Fractures.",Crowe RP; Kennel J; Fernandez AR; Burton BA; Wang HE; Van Vleet L; Bourn SS; Myers JB,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate racial and ethnic disparities in out-of-hospital analgesic administration, accounting for the influence of clinical characteristics and community socioeconomic vulnerability, among a national cohort of patients with long bone fractures. METHODS: Using the 2019-2020 ESO Data Collaborative, we retrospectively analyzed emergency medical services (EMS) records for 9-1-1 advanced life support transport of adult patients diagnosed with long bone fractures at the emergency department. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for out-of-hospital analgesic administration by race and ethnicity, accounting for age, sex, insurance, fracture location, transport time, pain severity, and scene Social Vulnerability Index. We reviewed a random sample of EMS narratives without analgesic administration to identify whether other clinical factors or patient preferences could explain differences in analgesic administration by race and ethnicity. RESULTS: Among 35,711 patients transported by 400 EMS agencies, 81% were White, non-Hispanic, 10% were Black, non-Hispanic, and 7% were Hispanic. In crude analyses, Black, non-Hispanic patients with severe pain were less likely to receive analgesics compared with White, non-Hispanic patients (59% versus 72%; Risk Difference: -12.5%, 95% CI: -15.8% to -9.9%). After adjustment, Black, non-Hispanic patients remained less likely to receive analgesics compared with White, non-Hispanic patients (aOR:0.65, 95% CI:0.53 to 0.79). Narrative review identified similar rates of patients declining analgesics offered by EMS and analgesic contraindications across racial and ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among EMS patients with long bone fractures, Black, non-Hispanic patients were substantially less likely to receive out-of-hospital analgesics compared with White, non-Hispanic patients.

"Patient preferences, regret, and health-related quality of life among older adults with acute myeloid leukemia: A pilot longitudinal study.",LoCastro M; Wang Y; Sanapala C; Jensen-Battaglia M; Wittink M; Norton S; Klepin HD; Richardson DR; Mendler JH; Liesveld J; Huselton E; Loh KP,"INTRODUCTION: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with poor outcomes and is generally incurable. Therefore, understanding preferences of older adults with AML is critical. We sought to assess whether best-worst scaling (BWS) can be used to capture attributes considered by older adults with AML when making initial treatment decisions and longitudinally, as well as assess changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and decisional regret over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a longitudinal study for adults ≥60 years with newly diagnosed AML, we collected: (1) attributes of treatment most important to patients using BWS, (2) HRQoL using EQ-5D-5L, (3) decisional regret using the Decisional Regret Scale, and (4) treatment worthiness using the ""Was it worth it?"" questionnaire. Data was collected at baseline and over six months. A hierarchical Bayes model was used to allocate percentages out of 100%. Due to small sample size, hypothesis testing was performed at α = 0.10 (2-tailed). We analyzed how these measures differed by treatment choice (intensive vs. lower intensity treatment). RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 76 years (n = 15). At baseline, the most important attributes of treatment to patients were response to treatment (i.e., chance that the cancer will respond to treatment; 20.9%). Compared to those who received lower intensity treatment (n = 7) or best supportive care (n = 2), those who received intensive treatment (n = 6) generally ranked ""alive one year or more after treatment"" (p = 0.03) with higher importance and ranked ""daily activities"" (p = 0.01) and ""location of treatment"" (p = 0.01) with less importance. Overall, HRQoL scores were high. Decisional regret was mild overall and lower for patients who chose intensive treatment (p = 0.06). DISCUSSION: We demonstrated that BWS can be used to assess the importance of various treatment attributes considered by older adults with AML when making initial treatment decisions and longitudinally throughout treatment. Attributes of treatment important to older patients with AML differed between treatment groups and changed over time.

Patient preferences for telehealth services in a large multispecialty practice.,Ebbert JO; Ramar P; Tulledge-Scheitel SM; Njeru JW; Rosedahl JK; Roellinger D; Philpot LM,"INTRODUCTION: Telehealth service provision has accelerated during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As the pandemic continues, clinical practices have discovered ways to resume operations. Opportunities exist to understand patient preferences for telehealth clinical services and to tailor offerings to different demographic groups. METHODS: We conducted a survey of patients receiving telehealth services through our outpatient practice to understand the types of healthcare services for which patients report preferences for telehealth. RESULTS: We received 551 survey responses (response rate = 20.8%; 551/2650). More than half of patients indicated being 'very likely' to use telehealth services to refill medication(s) (67.3%), prepare for an upcoming visit (66.1%), review test results (60.3%), or receive education (54.2%). Males had lower odds of preferring telehealth services for reviewing test results (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34-0.94) or mental health issues (OR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.38-0.77). Respondents who received a video visit were significantly more likely than those who received a telephone visit to report preferences for using telehealth for education, care plan discussions, long-term health issues, and mental health.

Preferences for first-line treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma among US practicing oncologists and patients.,Grivas P; Veeranki P; Chiu K; Pawar V; Chang J; Bharmal M,"Aim: Investigate oncologist and patient preferences for the first-line treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma. Materials & methods: A discrete-choice experiment was used to elicit treatment attribute preferences, including patient treatment experience (number and duration of treatments and grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events), overall survival and treatment administration frequency. Results: The study included 151 eligible medical oncologists and 150 patients with urothelial carcinoma. Both physicians and patients appeared to prefer treatment attributes related to overall survival, treatment-related adverse events and the number and duration of the medications in a regimen over frequency of administration. Overall survival had the most influence in driving oncologists' treatment preferences, followed by the patient's treatment experience. Patients found the treatment experience the most important attribute when considering options, followed by overall survival. Conclusion: Patient preferences were based on treatment experience, while oncologists preferred treatments that prolong overall survival.

Radiotherapy Use in Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer: Review of the Guidelines and Impact of Increased Awareness in Patient Referral at a Tertiary Center in Belgium.,Verghote F; Van Praet C; De Maeseneer D; Berquin C; Vanneste B; De Visschere P; Verbeke SLJ; Fonteyne V,"PURPOSE: Pronounced underuse of radiotherapy (RT) in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is reported. This study aims to assess the awareness about the role of RT in different MIBC settings and see whether this has increased since 2017. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the bladder cancer guidelines of the EAU, ESMO, NCCN, NICE, and AUA/ASCO/ASTRO/SUO, focusing on the role of RT in MIBC. In 2017, we evaluated the use of RT in MIBC in Belgium. This raised awareness about the indications of RT in different MIBC settings. Here, we present a retrospective pattern of care analysis of the RT use for MIBC patients at our center from January 2012 until December 2021. Frequency of RT use, patient, disease and treatment characteristics were compared between two 5-year periods (2012-2016 and 2017-2021). RESULTS: Review of the guidelines suggested that RT can be used as a treatment option in most MIBC settings. However, differences between guideline recommendations existed and high-level evidence was often lacking. Overall, 221 unique MIBC patients received RT at our center. RT use for MIBC was 39% higher in the second 5-year period (Between the same periods, the number of new MIBC registrations increased with 26%). The most pronounced increase, ie, 529%, was observed in the primary setting and was in parallel with patient preference becoming the main indication for RT. Participation in clinical trials seems to have had an important impact on the frequency of RT use in the adjuvant and metastatic setting. CONCLUSION: We provide a critical overview of the RT indications in MIBC as recommended by the international guidelines. Increased awareness about RT as a treatment option in MIBC seems to have an impact on the treatment choice in clinical practice, as was observed in our tertiary center.",2023,,Cancer Manag Res,15,,511-521,,10.2147/CMAR.S407031,37337479,#1163,Verghote 2023,,,0
Face-down positioning or posturing after pars plana vitrectomy for macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachments.,Fung TH; Yim TW; Lois N; Wright DM; Liu SH; Williamson T,"BACKGROUND: A macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is one of the most common ophthalmic surgical emergencies and causes significant visual morbidity. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with gas tamponade is often performed to repair primary macula-involving RRDs with a high rate of anatomical retinal reattachment. It has been advocated by some ophthalmologists that face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade helps reduce postoperative retinal displacement. Retinal displacement can cause metamorphopsia and binocular diplopia. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review is to determine whether face-down positioning reduces the risk of retinal displacement following PPV and gas tamponade for primary macula-involving RRDs. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2022, Issue 11), MEDLINE (January 1946 to 28 November 2022), Embase.com (January 1947 to 28 November 2022), PubMed (1948 to 28 November 2022), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database (1982 to 28 November 2022), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search. We last searched the electronic databases on 28 November 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which face-down positioning was compared with no positioning or another form of positioning following PPV and gas tamponade for primary macula-involving RRDs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodology and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for the prespecified outcomes using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three RCTs (369 eyes of 368 participants) that met the eligibility criteria. Two RCTs provided data on postoperative retinal displacement, one reported on postoperative distortion and quality of life outcomes, two on postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in logMAR, and two on postoperative ocular adverse events such as outer retinal folds. Study characteristics and risk of bias All the trials involved predominantly male participants (range: 68% to 72%). Only one trial provided race and ethnicity information, was registered on a trial registry, and reported funding sources. Using the RoB 2 tool, we assessed the risk of bias for proportion of eyes with retinal displacement, mean change in visual acuity, objective distortion scores, quality of life assessments, and ocular adverse events, with most domains judged to be at low risk of bias. Findings Immediate face-down positioning may result in a lower proportion of participants with postoperative retinal displacement compared with support-the-break positioning at six months (risk ratio [RR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54 to 0.99; 1 RCT; 239 eyes of 239 participants; very low certainty evidence). One study found no evidence of a difference in BCVA at three months when comparing postoperative face-up with face-down positioning with or without perfluorocarbon liquid (mean difference [MD] -0.03, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.02; I(2) = 0; 56 eyes of 56 participants; very low certainty evidence). Immediate face-down positioning appears to have little to no effect on postoperative distortion scores at week 26 (MD 1.80, 95% CI -1.92 to 5.52; 1 RCT; 219 eyes of 219 participants; very low certainty evidence) and postoperative quality of life assessment scores at week 26 (MD -1.80, 95% CI -5.52 to 1.92; 1 RCT; 217 eyes of 217 participants; very low certainty evidence). Adverse events One study that enrolled 262 participants with macula-involving RRDs suggested that immediate face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade may reduce the ocular adverse event of postoperative outer retinal folds at six months (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.90; 1 RCT; 262 eyes of 262 participants; very low certainty evidence) and binocular diplopia (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.90; 1 RCT; 262 eyes of 262 participants; very low certainty evidence) compared with support-the-break positioning. Immediate face-down positioning may increase the ocular adverse event of elevated intraocular pressure compared with support-the-break positioning (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.73; 1 RCT; 262 eyes of 262 participants; very low certainty evidence). Another study found no evidence of a difference in postoperative outer retinal folds when comparing face-down versus face-up positioning at one and three months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.02; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.28 to 3.61; 1 RCT; 56 eyes of 56 participants; very low certainty evidence). No studies reported non-ocular adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Very low certainty evidence suggests that immediate face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade may result in a reduction in postoperative retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia, but may increase the chance of postoperative raised intraocular pressure compared with support-the-break positioning at six months. We identified two ongoing trials that compare face-down positioning with face-up positioning following PPV and gas tamponade in participants with primary macula-involving RRDs, whose results may provide relevant evidence for our stated objectives. Future trials should be rigorously designed, and investigators should analyze outcome data appropriately and report adequate information to provide evidence of high certainty. Quality of life and patient preferences should be examined in addition to clinical and adverse event outcomes.",2024,Mar,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,3,3,CD015514,,10.1002/14651858.CD015514.pub2,38488250,#237,Fung 2024,,,0
First-in-man report of transsubclavian venous implantation of the Aveir leadless cardiac pacing system.,Balanescu DV; Ward RC; Amin H; Noseworthy PA; Asirvatham SJ; Friedman PA; Mulpuru SK,"INTRODUCTION: Transsubclavian venous implantation of the Aveir leadless cardiac pacemaker (LCP) has not been previously reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three cases of transsubclavian implantation of the Aveir LCP are reported. Two cases were postbilateral orthotopic lung transplant, without appropriate femoral or jugular access due to recent ECMO cannulation and jugular central venous catheters. In one case, there was strong patient preference for same-day discharge. Stability testing confirmed adequate fixation and electrical testing confirmed stable parameters in all cases. All patients tolerated the procedure well without significant immediate complications.

Jargon Be Gone - Patient Preference in Doctor Communication.,Allen KA; Charpentier V; Hendrickson MA; Kessler M; Gotlieb R; Marmet J; Hause E; Praska C; Lunos S; Pitt MB,"While it has been shown that healthcare providers often use medical jargon, less is known about how patients prefer their clinicians communicate. This mixed-methods study aimed to better understand the general public's preference in healthcare communication. A volunteer cohort of 205 adult attendees at the 2021 Minnesota State Fair was presented a survey with two scenarios at a doctor's office sharing the same information: one using medical terminology and one using simpler, jargon-free language. Survey participants were asked which doctor they preferred, to describe each doctor, and to explain why they believe that doctors may use medical terminology. Common descriptive themes for the jargon-using doctor included that this doctor caused confusion, was too technical, and was uncaring, while the doctor who spoke without jargon was perceived as a good communicator, caring/empathetic, and approachable. Respondents perceived a range of reasons why doctors use jargon, from not recognizing they are using words that are not understood to trying to make themselves feel more important. Overall, 91% of survey respondents preferred the doctor who communicated without medical jargon.",2023,,J Patient Exp,10,,23743735231158942,,10.1177/23743735231158942,36873911,#1500,Allen 2023,,,0
"Talking, not training, increased the accuracy of physicians' diagnosis of their patients' preferences for colon cancer screening.",Valentine K; Leavitt L; Simmons L; Sepucha K; Atlas SJ; Korsen N; Han PKJ; Fairfield KM,"OBJECTIVE: Identify if primary care physicians (PCPs) accurately understand patient preferences for colorectal cancer (CRC) testing, whether shared decision making (SDM) training improves understanding of patient preferences, and whether time spent discussing CRC testing improves understanding of patient preferences. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a trial comparing SDM training plus a reminder arm to a reminder alone arm. PCPs and their patients completed surveys after visits assessing whether they discussed CRC testing, patient testing preference, and time spent discussing CRC testing. We compared patient and PCP responses, calculating concordance between patient-physician dyads. Multilevel models tested for differences in preference concordance by arm or time discussing CRC. RESULTS: 382 PCP and patient survey dyads were identified. Most dyads agreed on whether CRC testing was discussed (82%). Only 52% of dyads agreed on the patient's preference. SDM training did not impact accuracy of PCPs preference diagnoses (55%v.48%,p = 0.22). PCPs were more likely to accurately diagnose patient's preferences when discussions occurred, regardless of length. CONCLUSION: Only half of PCPs accurately identified patient testing preferences. Training did not impact accuracy. Visits where CRC testing was discussed resulted in PCPs better understanding patient preferences.

U.S. patient preferences for long-acting HIV treatment: a discrete choice experiment.,Graham SM; Barthold D; Hauber B; Brah AT; Saldarriaga E; Collier AC; Ho RJY; Marconi VC; Simoni JM,"INTRODUCTION: Recent advances in long-acting antiretroviral therapy (LA-ART) could provide new options for HIV treatment and reduce adherence barriers, if regimens are acceptable to patients. We elicited preferences for key attributes of potential LA-ART regimens among people with HIV (PWH) in the United States, focusing on four treatment modes (oral tablets, subcutaneous injections, intramuscular injections, and implants), product characteristics and location of administration. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was conducted among PWH aged ≥18 years recruited from HIV clinics in Washington State and Atlanta, Georgia from March 2021 to June 2022. Participants responded to 17 choice scenarios, each with three options: two systematically generated hypothetical LA-ART regimens and a constant opt-out (their current daily oral treatment). LA-ART regimen descriptions included treatment mode, pain, dosing frequency, location, pre-treatment time with undetectable viral load, pre-treatment negative reaction testing and ""late-dose leeway"" (i.e. flexibility or forgiveness in timing the next dose). We used conditional logistic regression, with an interaction between treatment mode and pain, to estimate preference weights for all attribute levels. RESULTS: Seven hundred participants (350 at each site) enrolled, with median age 51 years (range 18-73); 70% identified as cisgender male, 24% as cisgender female and 6% as non-binary or transgender. LA oral tablets were the only mode preferred over current daily oral treatment, with annual implants and injections the next most preferred LA-ART option. Longer time between doses was preferred, and administration at home was preferred to clinics, which were preferred to pharmacies. Attributes with less impact on preferences included oral lead-in treatment to achieve viral suppression or test for negative reactions and late-dose leeway around the prescribed dosing interval. Participants in Atlanta were more likely to prefer their current daily oral ART than participants from Seattle. CONCLUSIONS: PWH in the United States may soon have several options for LA-ART. Our results suggest that LA oral tablets will be preferred by many patients over their current daily oral treatment, while implants and injections with longer duration may be acceptable to some. Future research should investigate sources of preference heterogeneity and actual uptake of and adherence to LA-ART products, when available.",2023,Jul,J Int AIDS Soc,26 Suppl 2,Suppl 2,e26099,,10.1002/jia2.26099,37439051,#1092,Graham 2023,,,1
Preferences for Anaemia Treatment Attributes among Patients with Non-Dialysis-Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease.,Alexandre AF; Morga A; Thomas C; Krucien N; Tervonen T; Jiletcovici A; Marsh K,"INTRODUCTION: Information about patient preferences for the treatment of anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is scarce. Hence, our aim was to examine how patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD valued attributes of alternative hypothetical anaemia treatments. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in adult patients who reported a clinical diagnosis of CKD-related anaemia. Treatment attributes included mode and frequency of administration, need for iron supplementation, risk of gastrointestinal side effects, risk of major cardiovascular events and impact on energy levels (as defined by the vitality section of the SF-6D health index). Logit models were used to analyse patients' preferences. RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 200 patients in four countries. Patients preferred an oral mode of administration. Patients were willing to tolerate a 5.1% (95% CI 2.0-8.3%) increase in the risk of a major cardiovascular event and an 11.7% (95% CI 5.0-18.5%) increase in the risk of gastrointestinal side effects to switch from an at-home subcutaneous injection administered once every 2 weeks to an at-home oral pill administered three times a week. Patients were willing to tolerate a 20.3% (95% CI 15.0-25.6%) increase in the risk of gastrointestinal side effects and an 8.9% (95% CI 6.1-11.7%) increase in the risk of a major cardiovascular event to transition from 'Sometimes having a lot of energy' to 'Always having a lot of energy'. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD-related anaemia demonstrated clear treatment preferences and were willing to accept increased gastrointestinal or cardiovascular risks in exchange for more energy or an oral treatment.",2023,Feb,Adv Ther,40,2,641-657,,10.1007/s12325-022-02367-z,36449257,#1556,Alexandre 2023,,,1

EXPERT OPINION: It is paramount to agree in a common definition for diagnosing and properly treating SAA patients, and for that purpose, multidetector computer tomography is essential. The results of recent trials led to the expansion of transcatheter aortic valve replacement among patients of all the surgical-risk spectrum, and the choice of treatment (transcatheter, surgical) should be based on patient comorbidities, anatomical characteristics, and patient preferences.",2023,Jul-Dec,Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther,21,11,747-761,,10.1080/14779072.2023.2271395,37869793,#1081,Prieto-Lobato 2023,,,0
"Effective growth hormone replacement with once-weekly somapacitan in Japanese children with growth hormone deficiency: Results from REAL4, a phase 3 clinical trial.",Mori J; Ohata Y; Fujisawa Y; Sato Y; Röhrich S; Rasmussen MH; Bang RB; Horikawa R,"OBJECTIVE: Somapacitan is a long-acting growth hormone (GH) derivative developed for the treatment of GH deficiency (GHD). This study evaluates the efficacy and tolerability of somapacitan in Japanese children with GHD after 104 weeks of treatment and after switch from daily GH. DESIGN: Subanalysis on Japanese patients from a randomised, open-labelled, controlled parallel-group phase 3 trial (REAL4, NCT03811535). PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Thirty treatment-naïve patients were randomised 2:1 to somapacitan (0.16 mg/kg/week) or daily GH (0.034 mg/kg/day) up to Week 52, after which all patients received somapacitan. Height velocity (HV; cm/year) at Weeks 52 and 104 were the primary measurements. Additional assessments included HV SD score (SDS), height SDS, bone age, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) SDS, and observer-reported outcomes. RESULTS: At Week 52, observed mean HV was similar between treatment groups (10.3 vs. 9.8 cm/year for somapacitan and daily GH, respectively). Similar HVs between groups were also observed at Week 104: 7.4 cm/year after continuous somapacitan treatment (soma/soma) and 7.9 cm/year after 1-year somapacitan treatment following switch from daily GH (switch). Other height-related endpoints supported continuous growth. IGF-I SDS increased in both groups with mean IGF-I SDS within -2 and +2 during the study. Somapacitan was well tolerated, one mild injection site reaction was reported, with no reports of injection site pain. Patient preference questionnaires showed that most patients and their caregivers (90.9%) who switched treatment at Week 52 preferred once-weekly somapacitan over daily GH treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Somapacitan showed sustained efficacy in Japanese children with GHD over 104 weeks and for 52 weeks after switching from daily GH.

"Real-World Use of Albutrepenonacog Alfa, A Recombinant Coagulation Factor IX Albumin Fusion Protein, for Personalized Prophylaxis in Japanese Individuals With Hemophilia B: A Case Series.",Nagao A; Bingo M; Yamaguchi T; Fukutake K,"Currently, the mainstay of disease management for hemophilia B, a hemorrhagic disease caused by a congenital deficiency or molecular abnormalities of blood coagulation factor IX (FIX), is prophylaxis using FIX concentrate. On-demand injections of FIX concentrate may also be required, even during prophylaxis, when a patient with hemophilia B is bleeding. Albutrepenonacog alfa (rFIX-FP) is a human albumin fusion gene recombinant FIX, which is administered once every seven, 14, or 21 days, depending on patient preferences and symptoms. Studies have demonstrated its efficacy and safety in a range of patients; however, to date, reports of real-world experiences of the use of rFIX-FP in Japan are limited. We present a case series of three Japanese individuals with moderately severe (FIX activity 1 to <2%) or severe (FIX activity <1%) hemophilia B who benefited from prophylaxis using rFIX-FP in our clinical practice setting. We highlighted the good effectiveness of rFIX-FP in a patient with moderately severe hemophilia B who required prophylaxis due to joint bleeding, which was causing deterioration of his left ankle joint, as well as in a patient with severe hemophilia B and atherothrombotic cerebral infarction, whose trough level had to be ≥5% for concomitant use of an antiplatelet drug, and in a patient with severe hemophilia B who was working in nursing care, which involved heavy labor and night shifts, and who had previously been treated with on-demand FIX concentrate. In all three cases, rFIX-FP improved disease symptoms, and the patients were able to maintain steady states of therapy due to the treatment characteristics of rFIX-FP, which stabilizes FIX at high trough levels.",2023,Jan,Cureus,15,1,e33573,,10.7759/cureus.33573,36779089,#1594,Nagao 2023,,,0
Comparison of Selective Nerve Root Pulsed Radiofrequency Vs Paramedian Interlaminar Epidural Steroid Injection for the Treatment of Painful Cervical Radiculopathy.,Yildiz G; Perdecioglu GRG; Akkaya OT; Can E; Yuruk D,"BACKGROUND: Although there are studies evaluating ultrasound-guided selective nerve root pulsed radiofrequency (ULSD-SNRPRF) and fluoroscopy-guided paramedian cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injection (FL-CIESI) for the treatment of chronic cervical radicular pain, no study has compared the efficacy of these 2 methods. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the efficacy of these 2 methods, their superiority to each other, and the incidence of adverse events. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Outpatient department of a single-center pain clinic. METHODS: Sixty patients who did not respond to conservative treatments for lower cervical radicular pain were randomly divided into 2 groups. One group underwent ULSD-SNRPRF (Group U), and the other underwent paramedian FL-CIESI (Group F). Patients were evaluated pretreatment, and 3 and 6 months posttreatment. The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) was used to assess clinical improvement, The Neck Disability Index (NDI) to assess improvement in functional disability, and the Self-Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs Pain Score (S-LANSS) to assess the treatment's effect on neuropathic pain. Clinically significant pain relief was defined as a 50% or more pain reduction in the NRS-11. The posttreatment reduction in medication consumption was assessed using the Medication Quantification Scale Version III (MQS III). We also evaluated whether there was a difference in treatment-related characteristics, such as procedure time and adverse events. RESULTS: The procedure time was significantly longer in Group U. Blood aspiration was observed in 2 patients in Group U and vascular spread in one patient in Group F, with no significant difference. At 3 and 6 months posttreatment, NRS-11 and NDI scores showed a significant decrease compared to the pretreatment scores in both groups; there was no difference between the groups. Both treatments effectively improved neuropathic pain, with no significant difference between the S-LANSS scores. There was no difference in the reduction of medication consumption between the groups. LIMITATIONS: There was no sham or control group, and the follow-up period was limited to 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Pain relief, functional improvement, and safety were similar between groups. ULSD-SNRPRF and paramedian FL-CIESI are 2 different effective techniques for chronic cervical radicular pain. The choice of method should depend on various factors, such as patient preference, operator experience, and availability of resources. An advantage of ULSD over fluoroscopy is that patients and physicians are not exposed to radiation.",2024,Feb,Pain Physician,27,2,E221-E229,,,38324787,#403,Yildiz 2024,,,0
Evaluation of pharmacist impact on diabetes outcomes for telehealth and hybrid care delivery versus in-office visits.,Herber E; Bondar A; Hockings J; Hermiller T; Russo-Alvarez G; Wang L; Schulz L,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the effect of pharmacist-led telemanagement on diabetes outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: Assess for noninferiority for the absolute change in mean A1C between telehealth and hybrid groups versus the in-office group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives were to compare the percentage of patients achieving population health A1C goals and patient no-show rates between study groups. METHODS: A retrospective, noninferiority analysis was conducted for patients seen by a primary care pharmacist from November 1, 2020 to May 31, 2021 across 17 primary care clinics in the Northeast Ohio region of Cleveland Clinic. The noninferiority margin was prespecified at > 0.3% A1C reduction. Patients with a baseline A1C of 8% or greater were included. Patients were separated into 3 study groups (telehealth, in-office, and hybrid) based on the visit types that were conducted by the pharmacist during the study period. RESULTS: Hybrid care delivery (N = 366) was noninferior to in-office care delivery (N = 180), with regards to absolute change in mean A1C reduction (0.24% [95% CI: -0.13, 0.61], P = 0.002). Similar results were shown when comparing the telehealth group (N = 691) to the in-office group (0.04 [95% CI: -0.28, 0.36], P = 0.02). The mean A1C reduction in the in-office (1.36 ± 1.9), hybrid (1.60 ± 2.2), and telehealth (1.40 ± 2.0) groups were not significantly different (P = 0.23). Subgroup analyses showed that newly consulted patients had a larger reduction in A1C compared to the overall population, in all groups. No-show rates and percentage of patients achieving population health A1C goals were not significantly different based on visit type.

Diabetes patient preferences for glucose-monitoring technologies: results from a discrete choice experiment in Poland and the Netherlands.,Smith IP; Whichello CL; Veldwijk J; Rutten-van Mölken MPMH; Groothuis-Oudshoorn CGM; Vos RC; de Bekker-Grob EW; de Wit GA,"INTRODUCTION: New glucose-monitoring technologies have different cost-benefit profiles compared with traditional finger-prick tests, resulting in a preference-sensitive situation for patients. This study aimed to assess the relative value adults with diabetes assign to device attributes in two countries. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults with type 1 or 2 diabetes from the Netherlands (n=226) and Poland (n=261) completed an online discrete choice experiment. Respondents choose between hypothetical glucose monitors described using seven attributes: precision, effort to check, number of finger pricks required, risk of skin irritation, information provided, alarm function and out-of-pocket costs. Panel mixed logit models were used to determine attribute relative importance and to calculate expected uptake rates and willingness to pay (WTP). RESULTS: The most important attribute for both countries was monthly out-of-pocket costs. Polish respondents were more likely than Dutch respondents to choose a glucose-monitoring device over a standard finger prick and had higher WTP for a device. Dutch respondents had higher WTP for device improvements in an effort to check and reduce the number of finger pricks a device requires. CONCLUSION: Costs are the primary concern of patients in both countries when choosing a glucose monitor and would likely hamper real-world uptake. The costs-benefit profiles of such devices should be critically reviewed.",2023,Jan,BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care,11,1,,,10.1136/bmjdrc-2022-003025,36649973,#1625,Smith 2023,,,1
Subcutaneous immunoglobulin for patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: a real-world single centre experience.,Ma Z; Johnson D; Gniadecki R; Ritchie B; Keeling S; Cohen Tervaert JW; Osman M,"OBJECTIVES: Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are heterogeneous diseases characterized by skeletal muscle inflammation associated with cutaneous, pulmonary, and/or other visceral organ involvement. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been recommended as an adjunct therapy for IIM patients refractory to conventional therapy. However, IVIG has high resource needs and increased risk of adverse reactions. Subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) therapy has been used as an alternative to IVIG in primary immunodeficiencies and neuroinflammatory disorders. We assessed the satisfaction, patient preference and effectiveness in IIM patients transitioned from IVIG to SCIG. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive 20 patients with IIM who were transitioned from IVIG to SCIG therapy for >12 months. Patient preference between IVIG vs SCIG was surveyed using a questionnaire previously used in studies with neuroinflammatory conditions. In addition, disease flares, changes in immunosuppression, cumulative prednisone doses and global disease activity were evaluated using the Myositis Intention to Treat Index (MITAX) 12-months prior to- and post-SCIG initiation. RESULTS: Most patients (78.9%) preferred SCIG over IVIG and preferred home-based therapies to hospital-based therapies. There was no significant difference in global disease activity (MITAX 3.31 vs 3.02) nor in cumulative steroid doses 12-months prior to- or post-SCIG initiation. Three patients experienced disease flares, 5 escalated in immunosuppression, while 4 patients deescalated in immunosuppressive medications. CONCLUSIONS: SCIG is preferred by most patients over IVIG without a substantial increased disease activity or need for additional corticosteroids. Future cost effectiveness studies may provide an additional rationale for utilizing SCIG over IVIG for maintenance therapy for IIM.",2023,Oct,Rheumatology (Oxford),,,,,10.1093/rheumatology/kead521,37796840,#792,Ma 2023,,,0
"Preferences for innovations in healthcare delivery models in the Swiss elderly population: a latent class, choice modelling study.",Nicolet A; Perraudin C; Krucien N; Wagner J; Peytremann-Bridevaux I; Marti J,"BACKGROUND: With the increasing number of people affected by multiple chronic conditions, it is essential for public-health professionals to promote strategies addressing patient needs for coordinated care. We aim to explore preference heterogeneity for better-coordinated care delivery models in Swiss older adults, and identify profiles of individuals more open to healthcare reforms. METHODS: A DCE (discrete choice experiment) survey was developed online and on paper for the Swiss adults aged 50+, following best practice. To elicit preferences, we estimated a latent class model allowing grouping individuals with similar preferences into distinct classes, and examined what background characteristics contributed to specific class membership. RESULTS: The optimal model identified three classes with different openness to reforms. Class 1 (49%) members were concerned with premium increases and were in favour of integrated care structures with care managed by interprofessional teams. Individuals in class 2 (19%) were younger, open to reforms, and expressed the needs for radical changes within the Swiss healthcare system. Class 3 respondents (32%) were strongly reluctant to changes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study goes beyond average preferences and identifies three distinct population profiles, a majority open to reforms on specific aspects of care delivery, a smallest group in favour radical changes, and a third strongly against changes. Therefore, tailored approaches around healthcare reforms are needed, e.g. explaining the role of interprofessional teams in coordinating care, electronic health records and insurance premium variation.",2024,Apr,Eur J Public Health,34,2,260-266,,10.1093/eurpub/ckae004,38243764,#174,Nicolet 2024,,,1
The application of discrete choice experiments eliciting young peoples' preferences for healthcare: a systematic literature review.,Williams G; Kinchin I,"OBJECTIVES: Understanding young people's preferences for healthcare is critical for reducing the negative effect of undesirable choices. This review aims to synthesise the evidence obtained from discrete choice experiments (DCEs) eliciting young people's preferences for healthcare interventions and service deliveries, specifically, to (1) examine the methodology, including a selection of attributes and levels, experimental design, estimation procedure and validity; (2) evaluate similarities, differences and rigour of designs to the general population DCEs; and, (3) compare the DCEs' application to the seven health priority areas defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO). METHODS: A systematic review searching Medline, EconLIT, PsychINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed up until May 2021. INCLUSION CRITERIA: a DCE, eliciting young peoples' preferences (10-24 years of age), on a healthcare-related topic defined by WHO, peer-reviewed, full-text available in English. A bespoke checklist was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. RESULTS: Eighteen DCE studies were included in the review, exploring interventions and service in sexual and reproductive health (n = 9; 50%), smoking cessation (n = 4; 22%), mental health (n = 1), nutrition (n = 1), unintentional injuries (n = 1), vaccination against severe but rare diseases (n = 1); and diabetes (n = 1). Compared to the general population, DCEs eliciting young people's preferences had a high proportion of monetary measures and a smaller number of choices per respondent with the overwhelming number of surveys using fractional factorial design. The majority of studies were of moderate quality (50-75% of the criteria met). CONCLUSIONS: While identified DCEs touched on most health priority areas, the scope was limited. The conduct and reporting of DCEs with young people could be improved by including the state-of-the-art design, estimation procedures and analysis.",2023,Aug,Eur J Health Econ,24,6,987-998,,10.1007/s10198-022-01528-9,36169764,#1033,Williams 2023,,,1
Growth Modification of Developing Class II Division 1 Malocclusion Using Myofunctional Appliances.,Alhasyimi AA; Syahfik I,"Background and Overview. Interceptive orthodontics is a phase of orthodontics that identifies and corrects potential malocclusions in the growing dentofacial complex. At this point, myofunctional appliances are a necessary component. A 9-year-old girl appeared with a Class II division 1, a 6 mm overjet, a 6 mm overbite, a V-shaped maxillary arch, as well as lip hypertonicity, and an overdeveloped maxilla. Myobrace® combines the dental alignment abilities of rigid and soft appliances. Its structure replicates a fixed appliance: the soft outer part acts as the orthodontic wire, whereas the inner hard part engages the teeth individually. After 12 months of treatment, facial photos and a cephalogram were taken, both of which demonstrated an enhancement to the patient's facial profile. Conclusions and Practical Implications. This case demonstrates that Myobrace® may be a simple and good choice to treat skeletal malocclusion with oral habit because of its greater compliance and favorable results. In certain instances, an early approach, taking into account patient preferences and compliance, is practical and should be considered in future treatment planning and research.",2023,,Case Rep Dent,2023,,8201195,,10.1155/2023/8201195,37766810,#871,Alhasyimi 2023,,,0

The aim is to clarify the legal standing and provide a framework that dentists and other healthcare professionals can adapt to their current clinical practice while increasing the confidence of those involved in the consent process; both professionals and patients.",2023,May,Br Dent J,234,9,655-659,,10.1038/s41415-023-5752-6,37173482,#1263,Sellars 2023,,,0
Patient characteristics and preferences for a surgical prehabilitation program design: results from a pilot survey.,Gurunathan U; Tronstad O; Stonell C,"PURPOSE: Surgical prehabilitation aims to reduce a decline in the functional capacity thereby optimising health and fitness before surgery. One of the major barriers in successfully implementing a prehabilitation program in hospitals has been poor patient adherence. In our pilot survey on surgical patients, we sought to explore patient preferences regarding the program design, the barriers and enablers to patient participation in a multimodal prehabilitation program. METHODS: The survey was administered to patients undergoing major abdominal surgery in the preoperative period. The first two parts of the instrument mainly included questions on demographics, social history, activity levels, interest towards prehabilitation program and their involvement in co-design, preferences towards the components of the program, the barriers and enablers. The last part of survey included symptom and physical assessments. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 24 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. The median age of our cohort was 71 (range 35-91) years and 75% were retired. 75% of our participants were extremely interested in improving health and fitness and 63% were very keen to co-design their program when explained. Home-based programs were preferred by most participants and among exercises, walking was preferred by 71% of the participants. One third of the participants were interested in professional dietary counselling. There were only two participants who preferred group psychological therapy while 25% preferred individual psychological counselling sessions. CONCLUSION: Our survey highlighted a need to design a personalised program with tailored interventions due to the wide variation in the interest and preferences among surgical patients.",2023,Mar,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,149,3,1361-1367,,10.1007/s00432-022-04420-4,36283998,#1484,Gurunathan 2023,,,0
"Prevalence, attitudes and concerns toward telepsychiatry and mobile health self-management tools among patients with mental disorders during and after the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide survey in Poland from 2020 to 2023.",Dominiak M; Gędek A; Antosik AZ; Mierzejewski P,"INTRODUCTION: Mobile Health (mHealth) is a rapidly growing field of medicine that has the potential to significantly change everyday clinical practice, including in psychiatry. The COVID-19 pandemic and technological developments have accelerated the adoption of telepsychiatry and mobile solutions, but patient perceptions and expectations of mHealth remain a key factor in its implementation. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess (1) the prevalence, (2) attitudes, preferences and (3) concerns about mobile mental health, including telepsychiatry and self-management tools, among patients with mental disorders over the period 2020-2023, i.e., at the onset, peak and after the expiration of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A semi-structured survey was administrated to 354 patients with mental disorders in Poland. The questions were categorized into three section, addressing prevalence, attitudes, and concerns about telepsychiatry and mobile health self-management tools. The survey was conducted continuously from May 2020 to the end of May 2023. RESULT: As many as 95.7% of patients with mental disorders used mobile devices at least once a week. Over the course of 3 years (from 2020 to 2023), there was a significant increase in the readiness of patients to embrace new technologies, with the percentage rising from 20% to 40%. In particular, a remarkable growth in patient preferences for telepsychiatry was observed, with a significant increase from 47% in 2020 to a substantial 96% in 2023. Similarly, mHealth self-management tools were of high interest to patients. In 2020, 62% of patients like the idea of using mobile apps and other mobile health tools to support the care and treatment process. This percentage also increased during the pandemic, reaching 66% in 2023. At the same time, the percentage of patients who have concerns about using m-health solutions has gradually decreased, reaching 35% and 28% in 2023 for telepsychiatry and for the reliability and safety of m-health self-management tools, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the growing acceptance of modern technologies in psychiatric care, with patients showing increased readiness to use telepsychiatry and mobile health self-management tools, in particular mobile applications, after the COVID-19 pandemic. This was triggered by the pandemic, but continues despite its expiry. In the face of patient readiness, the key issue now is to ensure the safety and efficacy of these tools, along with providing clear guidelines for clinicians. It is also necessary to draw the attention of health systems to the widespread implementation of these technologies to improve the care of patients with mental disorders.",2023,,Front Psychiatry,14,,1322695,,10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1322695,38260801,#488,Dominiak 2023,,,0
Nurses' work experiences in hospital wards with single rooms: An integrative review.,Søndergaard SF; Rasmussen B; Kerr D; Frederiksen K; Redley B; Trueman M; Kolbaek R; Laursen HS; Bloomer MJ,"AIM AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate evidence that examined nurses' work experiences in hospital wards with single rooms. The research question was 'What does the research tell us about nurses' work experiences in hospital wards with single rooms?' BACKGROUND: In the last decades, new hospital builds have moved towards including a high proportion of single rooms. Yet, single rooms create 'complex environments' that impact the nurses. DESIGN: A structured integrative review was undertaken of empirical evidence. METHODS: Original, peer-reviewed articles, written in English, were sourced from four databases: CINAHL, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. The initial searches were performed in April 2021 and repeated in December 2022. Quality appraisal was undertaken using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. A narrative synthesis approach was used to analyse the data. Reporting was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. RESULTS: Twelve studies, published between 2006 and 2022, with an international origin, and representing n = 826 nurses, were included in this review. The synthesis revealed mixed perspectives about nurses' work experiences in wards with single rooms. Whilst single rooms are 'all good in theory (and) a good idea', the reality was quite different. Synthesised findings are presented in four categories: (i) aesthetics and the physical space, (ii) privacy vs. isolation, (iii) safety, which includes situational awareness and (iv) communication and collaboration. CONCLUSION: This review describes how single rooms affects nurses' work experience. Whilst nurses shared multiple concerns about single rooms and the challenges they also acknowledged patient preference for the privacy and space afforded by single rooms. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Findings from this review highlight the need for careful planning to maintain and strengthen teamwork, prevent nurses' sense of working in isolation, as well as creating opportunities for mentorship, and collaboration among nurses when working in single-room settings.",2023,Oct,J Clin Nurs,32,19-20,7036-7049,,10.1111/jocn.16824,37462296,#825,Søndergaard 2023,,,0
Same-day discharge after transvenous lead extraction: feasibility and outcomes.,Atteya G; Alston M; Sweat A; Saleh M; Beldner S; Mitra R; Willner J; John RM; Epstein LM,"AIMS: Same-day discharge (SDD) is safe for patients undergoing electrophysiology procedures. There is no existing data regarding SDD for patients undergoing transvenous lead extraction (TLE). We report our experience with SDD for patients undergoing TLE. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study group included patients undergoing TLE between February 2020 and July 2021 without an infectious indication. A modified SDD protocol for device implants/ablations was applied to TLE patients. Patient characteristics, extraction details, outcomes, and complications were reviewed. Of 239 patients undergoing TLE, 210 were excluded (94 infections and 116 did not meet SDD criteria). Of the remaining 29 patients, seven stayed due to patient preference and 22 were discharged home the same day. The SDD group had an average age of 65.9 ± 12 (47-84), 41% female, and LVEF of 52.2 ± 18% (10-80). The indication for TLE was malfunction (20), upgrade (4), advisory lead (2), and magnetic resonance imaging compatibility (1). Extractions included four implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), 17 pacemakers (PPM), and one cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)-P system. The leads were 9.6 years (1.5-21.7) old, and 1.8 leads were removed per patient (1-3); the lead extraction difficulty (LED) score was 11.6 ± 7. Twenty underwent cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) re-implantation (2 ICD, 3 CRT-D, 13 PPM, and 2 CRT-P). For CIED re-implants, patients sent a remote transmission the next day, and all patients received a next-day call. There were no procedure or device-related issues, morbidities, or mortalities in the 30 days after discharge. CONCLUSION: Same-day discharge after TLE for non-infectious aetiologies is safe and feasible in a select group of patients with early procedure completion who meet strict SDD criteria.",2023,Feb,Europace,25,2,586-590,,10.1093/europace/euac185,36575941,#1513,Atteya 2023,,,0
Long-term outcomes of Gamma Knife radiosurgery in treating glossopharyngeal neuralgia.,Samanci Y; Mürdün E; Çil M; Düzkalir AH; Askeroglu MO; Peker S,"Glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN) is an unusual disorder causing severe, brief pain episodes in the areas supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve. Initial treatment involves medications like carbamazepine, but if these are ineffective or cause side effects, interventional pain management techniques or surgery may be considered. Gamma Knife radiosurgery is becoming popular in managing GPN due to its lower risk of complications than surgical interventions like microvascular decompression or rhizotomy. In this retrospective case series, we examined the outcomes of Gamma Knife radiosurgery in eight patients with GPN. The decision to utilize Gamma Knife radiosurgery was made following specific criteria, including failed surgical interventions, patient preference against surgery, or contraindications to surgical procedures. Patients were administered radiation doses within the range of 80 to 90 Gy, targeting either the cisternal glossopharyngeal nerve or glossopharyngeal meatus of the jugular foramen. Evaluations were conducted before the Gamma Knife radiosurgery; at 3, 6, and 12 months after Gamma Knife radiosurgery; and annually thereafter. Pain severity was assessed using the modified Barrow Neurological Institute scale grades, with patients achieving grade I-IIIa considered to have a good treatment outcome and grade IV-V to have a poor treatment outcome. Pain control and absence of radiosurgery-related complications were primary endpoints. The median age of the patients was 46.5 years, varying from 8 to 72 years. The median duration of pain was 32 months (range, 12-120 months). All patients, except one, were on polydrug therapy. All cases exhibited preoperative grade V pain. The median follow-up duration after Gamma Knife radiosurgery was 54.5 months, varying from 14 to 90 months. The overall clinical assessments revealed a gradual neurological improvement, particularly within the first 8.5 weeks (range, 1-12 weeks). The immediate outcomes at 3 months revealed that all patients (8/8, 100%) experienced pain relief, with 25% (2/8) achieving a medication-free status (Grade I). Three patients (37%) experienced a recurrence during the follow-up and were managed with repeat Gamma Knife radiosurgery (n = 2) and radiofrequency rhizotomy (n = 1). At the last follow-up, 88% (7/8) of patients had pain relief (Grades I-IIIa), with three (37%) achieving a medication-free status (Grade I). No adverse events or neurological complications occurred. The patient who underwent radiofrequency rhizotomy continued to experience inadequately controlled pain despite medication (Grade IV). Gamma Knife radiosurgery is a non-invasive, efficacious treatment option for idiopathic GPN, offering short- and long-term relief without permanent complications.",2024,Mar,Headache,64,3,323-328,,10.1111/head.14687,38385643,#285,Samanci 2024,,,0
"Exploring international differences in ovarian cancer care: a survey report on global patterns of care, current practices, and barriers.",Algera MD; Morton R; Sundar SS; Farrell R; van Driel WJ; Brennan D; Rijken MJ; Sfeir S; Allen L; Eiken M; Coleman RL,"OBJECTIVE: Although global disparities in survival rates for patients with ovarian cancer have been described, variation in care has not been assessed globally. This study aimed to evaluate global ovarian cancer care and barriers to care. METHODS: A survey was developed by international ovarian cancer specialists and was distributed through networks and organizational partners of the International Gynecologic Cancer Society, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology, and the European Society of Gynecological Oncology. Respondents received questions about care organization. Outcomes were stratified by World Bank Income category and analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regressions. RESULTS: A total of 1059 responses were received from 115 countries. Respondents were gynecological cancer surgeons (83%, n=887), obstetricians/gynecologists (8%, n=80), and other specialists (9%, n=92). Income category breakdown was as follows: high-income countries (46%), upper-middle-income countries (29%), and lower-middle/low-income countries (25%). Variation in care organization was observed across income categories. Respondents from lower-middle/low-income countries reported significantly less frequently that extensive resections were routinely performed during cytoreductive surgery. Furthermore, these countries had significantly fewer regional networks, cancer registries, quality registries, and patient advocacy groups. However, there is also scope for improvement in these components in upper-middle/high-income countries. The main barriers to optimal care for the entire group were patient co-morbidities, advanced presentation, and social factors (travel distance, support systems). High-income respondents stated that the main barriers were lack of surgical time/staff and patient preferences. Middle/low-income respondents additionally experienced treatment costs and lack of access to radiology/pathology/genetic services as main barriers. Lack of access to systemic agents was reported by one-third of lower-middle/low-income respondents. CONCLUSIONS: The current survey report highlights global disparities in the organization of ovarian cancer care. The main barriers to optimal care are experienced across all income categories, while additional barriers are specific to income levels. Taking action is crucial to improve global care and strive towards diminishing survival disparities and closing the care gap.",2023,Oct,Int J Gynecol Cancer,33,10,1612-1620,,10.1136/ijgc-2023-004563,37591611,#802,Algera 2023,,,0
Optimizing the Management Algorithm for Heartburn in General Gastroenterology: Cost-Effectiveness and Cost-Minimization Analysis.,Shah ED; Chan WW; Jodorkovsky D; Lee Lynch K; Patel A; Patel D; Yadlapati R,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Heartburn is the most common symptom seen in gastroenterology practice. We aimed to optimize cost-effective evaluation and management of heartburn. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model from insurer and patient perspectives comparing 4 strategies for patients failing empiric proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): (1) PPI optimization without testing, (2) endoscopy with PPI optimization for all patients, (3) endoscopy with PPI discontinuation when erosive findings are absent, and (4) endoscopy/ambulatory reflux monitoring with PPI discontinuation as appropriate for phenotypic management. Health outcomes were respectively defined on systematic reviews of clinical trials. Cost outcomes were defined on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services databases and commercial multipliers for direct healthcare costs, and national observational studies evaluating healthcare utilization. The time horizon was 1 year. All testing was performed off PPI. RESULTS: PPI optimization without testing cost $3784/y to insurers and $3128 to patients due to lower work productivity and suboptimal symptom relief. Endoscopy with PPI optimization lowered insurer costs by $1020/y and added 11 healthy days/y by identifying erosive reflux disease. Endoscopy with PPI discontinuation added 11 additional healthy days/y by identifying patients without erosive reflux disease that did not need PPI. By optimizing phenotype-guided treatment, endoscopy/ambulatory reflux monitoring with a trial of PPI discontinuation was the most effective of all strategies (gaining 22 healthy days/y) and saved $2183 to insurers and $2396 to patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with heartburn, endoscopy with ambulatory reflux monitoring (off PPI) optimizes cost-effective management by matching treatment to phenotype. When erosive findings are absent, trialing PPI discontinuation is more cost-effective than optimizing PPI.",2023,Sep,Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,,,,,10.1016/j.cgh.2023.08.026,37683879,#887,Shah 2023,,,0
A new wearable diagnostic home sleep testing platform: comparison with available systems and benefits of multinight assessments.,Walter J; Lee JY; Blake S; Kalluri L; Cziraky M; Stanek E; Miller J; Harty BJ; Yu L; Park J; Zhang M; Coughlin S; Serao A; Lee J; Buban A; Bae M; Edel C; Toloui O; Rangel SM; Power T; Xu S,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: We assessed the real-world performance of the ANNE Sleep system against 2 Food and Drug Administration-cleared home sleep testing platforms and the intraindividual night-to-night variability of respiratory event index measured by ANNE Sleep. METHODS: We evaluated the home performance of the ANNE Sleep system compared with 2 Food and Drug Administration-cleared home sleep testing platforms (WatchPAT: n = 29 and Alice NightOne: n = 46) during a synchronous night with unsupervised patient application. Additionally, we evaluated night-to-night variability of respiratory event index and total sleep time using the ANNE Sleep system (n = 30). RESULTS: For the diagnosis of moderate and severe obstructive sleep apnea, the ANNE Sleep system had a positive percent agreement of 58% (95% confidence interval, 28-85%) and a negative percent agreement of 100% (95% confidence interval, 80-100%) compared to WatchPAT. The positive and negative percent agreement for ANNE Sleep vs Alice NightOne was 85% (95% confidence interval, 66-96%) and 95% (95% confidence interval, 74-100%). There were no differences in mean total sleep time or respiratory event index across multiple nights of monitoring with ANNE. There were no differences consistent with a first-night effect but testing multiple nights reclassified obstructive sleep apnea severity in 5 (17%) individuals and detected 3 additional cases of moderate disease, with only a 12% (standard deviation, 28%) mean fluctuation in respiratory event index from the first night of testing compared to a mean of multiple nights. Overall, 80% of users found ANNE comfortable and easy to use. CONCLUSIONS: ANNE Sleep exhibited stronger concordance with Alice NightOne compared to WatchPAT. While we illustrated low night-to-night variability for ANNE Sleep, the results suggest multiple nights increased detection of moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea.

Factors associated with the effectiveness of immersive virtual therapy in alleviating depressive symptoms during sub-acute post-stroke rehabilitation: a gender comparison.,Juszko K; Kiper P; Wrzeciono A; Cieślik B; Gajda R; Szczepańska-Gieracha J,"BACKGROUND: The large-scale digitalization of healthcare has induced shifts in patient preferences, prompting the introduction of therapies utilizing novel technologies. In this context, the targeted application of these interventions is deemed as crucial as assessing their overall effectiveness. The aim of this study was to characterize the patient profile who benefited most from immersive virtual reality (VR) therapy. METHODS: Based on the results from the previous randomized controlled trial study, we employed an exploratory study design to determine the factors associated with the most significant mental health improvement. A secondary analysis was conducted on a sample of 83 participants, with further analysis of participants with elevated depression symptoms, as indicated by a score of > 10 on the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-30). Both groups participated in a similar post-stroke rehabilitation program; however, the experimental group also received additional VR therapy through an immersive VR garden intervention. The GDS-30 was used to assess mood and depressive symptoms, and sociodemographic, cognitive status as well as stroke-related variables were considered as potential factors. RESULTS: In both the experimental (mean change 5.3) and control groups (mean change 2.8), interventions significantly reduced depressive symptoms, with a more pronounced difference in the experimental group (p < 0.05). When examining gender differences, women exhibited greater improvement in the GDS, with mean between-group differences of 5.0 for the total sample and 6.0 for those with elevated depressive symptoms. Sociodemographic factors, cognitive status, and time from stroke were not found to be factors that alter the effectiveness of VR therapy. CONCLUSIONS: While VR therapy as an adjunctive treatment for post-stroke rehabilitation seems especially effective for women with elevated depressive symptoms, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the study's small experimental group size. Traditional methods showed reduced effectiveness in women compared to men; thus, developing technologically advanced and gender-specific approaches can lead to more tailored therapy.

Recruiting women with ductal carcinoma in situ to a randomised controlled trial: lessons from the LORIS study.,Wheelwright S; Matthews L; Jenkins V; May S; Rea D; Fairbrother P; Gaunt C; Young J; Pirrie S; Wallis MG; Fallowfield L,"BACKGROUND: The LOw RISk DCIS (LORIS) study was set up to compare conventional surgical treatment with active monitoring in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Recruitment to trials with a surveillance arm is known to be challenging, so strategies to maximise patient recruitment, aimed at both patients and recruiting centres, were implemented. METHODS: Women aged ≥ 46 years with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-high-grade DCIS were eligible for 1:1 randomisation to either surgery or active monitoring. Prior to randomisation, all eligible women were invited to complete: (1) the Clinical Trials Questionnaire (CTQ) examining reasons for or against participation, and (2) interviews exploring in depth opinions about the study information sheets and film. Women agreeing to randomisation completed validated questionnaires assessing health status, physical and mental health, and anxiety levels. Hospital site staff were invited to communication workshops and refresher site initiation visits to support recruitment. Their perspectives on LORIS recruitment were collected via surveys and interviews. RESULTS: Eighty percent (181/227) of eligible women agreed to be randomised. Over 40% of participants had high anxiety levels at baseline. On the CTQ, the most frequent most important reasons for accepting randomisation were altruism and belief that the trial offered the best treatment, whilst worries about randomisation and the influences of others were the most frequent most important reasons for declining. Most women found the study information provided clear and useful. Communication workshops for site staff improved knowledge and confidence but only about half said they themselves would join LORIS if eligible. The most common recruitment barriers identified by staff were low numbers of eligible patients and patient preference. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment to LORIS was challenging despite strategies aimed at both patients and site staff. Ensuring that recruiting staff support the study could improve recruitment in similar future trials.

Cultural influences on shared decision-making among Asian Americans: A systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies.,Tan NQP; Maki KG; López-Olivo MA; Geng Y; Volk RJ,"OBJECTIVE: To summarize how Asian Americans negotiate involvement in shared decision-making (SDM) with their providers, the cultural influences on SDM, and perceived barriers and facilitators to SDM. METHODS: This is a systematic review of qualitative studies. We searched six electronic databases and sources of gray literature until March 2021. Two reviewers independently screened studies, performed quality appraisal, and data extraction. Meta-synthesis was performed to summarize themes using a three-step approach. RESULTS: Twenty studies with 675 participants were included. We abstracted 275 initial codes and grouped these into 19 subthemes and 4 major themes: (1) negotiating power and differing expectations in SDM; (2) cultural influences on SDM; (3) importance of social support in SDM; and (4) supportive factors for facilitating SDM. CONCLUSIONS: Asian Americans have important perspectives, needs, and preferences regarding SDM that impacts how they engage with the provider on medical decisions and their perception of the quality of their care. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Asian American patients valued good communication and sufficient time with their provider, and that it is important for health professionals to understand patients' desired level of involvement in the SDM process and in the final decision, and who should be involved in SDM beyond the patient.

Implementation of a Standardized Shared Decision-making Bundle to Improve Communication Practices in the Neurocritical Care Unit.,Waseem H; Keegan J; Farrell K; Hwang DY; Oliver B; Olm-Shipman C; Pepin R; Mecchella J,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Shared decision-making (SDM) aligns patient preferences with health care team treatment goals. This quality improvement initiative implemented a standardized SDM bundle within a neurocritical care unit (NCCU), where unique demands make existing, provider-driven SDM practices challenging. METHODS: An interprofessional team defined key issues, identified barriers, and created change ideas to drive implementation of an SDM bundle using the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Model for Improvement framework incorporating Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. The SDM bundle included (1) a health care team huddle pre-SDM and post-SDM conversation; (2) a social worker-driven SDM conversation with the patient family, including core standardized communication elements to ensure consistency and quality; and (3) an SDM documentation tool within the electronic medical record to ensure the SDM conversation was accessible to all health care team members. The primary outcome measure was percentage of SDM conversations documented. RESULTS: Documentation of SDM conversations improved by 56%, from 27% to 83% pre/postintervention. Average time to documentation decreased by 4 days, from day 9 preintervention to day 5 postintervention. There was no significant change in NCCU length of stay, nor did palliative care consultation rates increase. Postintervention, SDM team huddle compliance was 94.3%. DISCUSSION: A team-driven, standardized SDM bundle that integrates with health care team workflows enabled SDM conversations to occur earlier and resulted in improved documentation of SDM conversations.

Disparities in Adult Patient Selection for Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in the United States: A Population-Level Study.,Mehta AB; Taylor JK; Day G; Lane TC; Douglas IS,"Rationale: Disparities in patient selection for advanced therapeutics in health care have been identified in multiple studies, but it is unclear if disparities exist in patient selection for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a rapidly expanding critical care resource. Objectives: To determine if disparities exist in patient selection for ECMO based on sex, primary insurance, and median income of the patient's neighborhood. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study using the Nationwide Readmissions Database 2016-2019, we identified patients treated with mechanical ventilation (MV) and/or ECMO with billing codes. Patient sex, insurance, and income level for patients receiving ECMO were compared with the patients treated with MV only, and hierarchical logistic regression with the hospital as a random intercept was used to determine odds of receiving ECMO based on patient demographics. Results: We identified 2,170,752 MV hospitalizations with 18,725 cases of ECMO. Among patients treated with ECMO, 36.1% were female compared with 44.5% of patients treated with> MV only (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] for ECMO, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.75). Of patients treated with ECMO, 38.1% had private insurance compared with 17.4% of patients treated with MV only. Patients with Medicaid were less likely to receive ECMO than patients with private insurance (aOR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.52-0.57). Patients treated with ECMO were more likely to live in the highest-income neighborhoods compared with patients treated with MV only (25.1% vs. 17.3%). Patients living in the lowest-income neighborhoods were less likely to receive ECMO than those living in the highest-income neighborhoods (aOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.60-0.67). Conclusions: Significant disparities exist in patient selection for ECMO. Female patients, patients with Medicaid, and patients living in the lowest-income neighborhoods are less likely to be treated with ECMO. Despite possible unmeasured confounding, these findings were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses. On the basis of previous work describing disparities in other areas of health care, we speculate that limited access in some neighborhoods, restrictive/biased interhospital transfer practices, differences in patient preferences, and implicit provider bias may contribute to the observed differences. Future studies with more granular data are needed to identify and modify drivers of observed disparities.",2023,Aug,Ann Am Thorac Soc,20,8,1166-1174,,10.1513/AnnalsATS.202212-1029OC,37021958,#1022,Mehta 2023,,,0
[Chronic Kidney Disease and Cancer: Ethical Choices].,Lenoci C; Gobber G; Brunori G,"Cancer and chronic kidney disease prevalence both increase with age. As a consequence, physicians are more frequently encountering older people with cancer who need dialysis, or patients on dialysis diagnosed with cancer. Decisions in this context are particularly complex and multifaceted. Informed decisions about dialysis require a personalised care plan that considers the prognosis and treatment options for each condition while also respecting patient preferences. The concept of prognosis should include quality-of-life considerations, functional status, and burden of care. Close collaboration between oncologists, nephrologists, geriatricians and palliativists is crucial to making optimal treatment decisions, and several tools are available for estimating cancer prognosis, prognosis of renal disease, and general age-related prognosis. Decision regarding the initiation or the termination of dialysis in patients with advanced cancer have also ethical implications. This last point is discussed in this article, and we delved into ethical issues with the aim of providing a pathway for the nephrologist to manage an elderly patient with ESRD and cancer.",2023,Oct,G Ital Nefrol,40,Suppl 81,,,,38007826,#796,Lenoci 2023,,,0
Surgical Outcomes Following Vestibular Schwannoma Resection in Patients over the Age of Sixty-five.,Strickland BA; Rennert R; Zada G; Shahrestani S; Russin JJ; Friedman RA; Giannotta SL,"Objective  Vestibular schwannoma (VS) are benign, often slow growing neoplasms. Some institutions opt for radiosurgery in symptomatic patients of advanced age versus surgical resection. The aim of the study is to analyze surgical outcomes of VS in patients over the age of 65 who were either not candidates for or refused radiosurgery. Methods  This includes retrospective analysis of VS patients between 1988 and 2020. Demographics, tumor characteristics, surgical records, and clinical outcomes were recorded. Patient preference for surgery over radiosurgery was recorded in the event that patients were offered both. Facial nerve outcomes were quantified using House-Brackmann (HB) scores. Tumor growth was defined by increase in size of >2 mm. Results  In total, 64 patients were included of average age 72.4 years (65-84 years). Average maximum tumor diameter was 29 mm (13-55 mm). Forty-five patients were offered surgery or GKRS, and chose surgery commonly due to radiation aversion (48.4%). Gross total resection was achieved in 39.1% ( n  = 25), near total 32.8% ( n  = 21), and subtotal 28.1% ( n  = 18). Average hospitalization was 5 days [2-17] with 75% ( n  = 48) discharged home. Postoperative HB scores were good (HB1-2) in 43.8%, moderate (HB3-4) in 32.8%, and poor (HB5-6) in 23.4%. HB scores improved to good in 51.6%, moderate in 31.3%, and remained poor in 17.1%, marking a rate of facial nerve improvement of 10.9%. Tumor control was achieved in 95.3% of cases at an average follow-up time of 37.8 months. Conclusion  VS resection can be safely performed in patients over the age of 65. Advanced age should not preclude a symptomatic VS patient from being considered for surgical resection.",2023,Apr,J Neurol Surg B Skull Base,84,2,129-135,,10.1055/a-1771-0504,36911086,#1353,Strickland 2023,,,0
Six month incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events among adults with HIV in northern Tanzania: a prospective observational study.,Stark K; O'Leary PRE; Sakita FM; Ford JS; Mmbaga BT; Blass B; Gedion K; Coaxum LA; Rutta A; Galson SW; Rugakingira A; Manavalan P; Bloomfield GS; Hertz JT,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to prospectively describe incident cardiovascular events among people living with HIV (PLWH) in northern Tanzania. Secondary aims of this study were to understand non-communicable disease care-seeking behaviour and patient preferences for cardiovascular care and education. DESIGN: A prospective observational study. SETTING: This study was conducted at the Majengo HIV Care and Treatment Clinic, an outpatient government-funded clinic in Moshi, Tanzania PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients presenting to an HIV clinic for routine care in northern Tanzania were enrolled from 1 September 2020 to 1 March 2021. INTERVENTIONS: At enrolment, participants completed a survey and a resting 12-lead ECG was obtained. At 6 month follow-up, a repeat survey regarding interim health events and repeat ECG was obtained. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Interim major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were defined by: self-reported interim stroke, self-reported hospitalisation for heart failure, self-reported interim myocardial infarction, interim myocardial infarction by ECG criteria (new pathologic Q waves in two contiguous leads) or death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). RESULTS: Of 500 enrolled participants, 477 (95.4%) completed 6 month follow-up and 3 (0.6%) died. Over the 6 month follow-up period, 11 MACE occurred (3 strokes, 6 myocardial infarctions, 1 heart failure hospitalisation and 1 cardiovascular death), resulting in an incidence rate of 4.58 MACE per 100 person-years. Of participants completing 6 month follow-up, 31 (6.5%) reported a new non-communicable disease diagnosis, including 23 (4.8%) with a new hypertension diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of MACE among PLWH in Tanzania is high. These findings are an important preliminary step in understanding the landscape of CVD among PLWH in Tanzania and highlight the need for interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk in this population.",2023,Nov,BMJ Open,13,11,e075275,,10.1136/bmjopen-2023-075275,37984949,#673,Stark 2023,,,0
Patient preferences and comfort for cancer survivorship models of care: results of an online survey.,Attai DJ; Katz MS; Streja E; Hsiung JT; Marroquin MV; Zavaleta BA; Nekhlyudov L,"PURPOSE: Workforce shortages will impact oncologists' ability to provide both active and survivorship care. While primary care provider (PCP) or survivorship clinic transition has been emphasized, there is little evidence regarding patient comfort. METHODS: We developed an online survey in partnership with patient advocates to assess survivors' comfort with PCP or survivorship clinic care and distributed the survey to online, cancer-specific patient communities from June to August 2020. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 975 surveys were complete. Most respondents were women (91%) and had private insurance (65%). Thirty-six cancer types were reported. Ninety-three percent had a PCP. Twenty-four percent were comfortable seeing a PCP for survivorship care. Higher odds of comfort were seen among respondents who were Black or had stage 0 cancer; female sex was associated with lower odds. Fifty-five percent were comfortable with a survivorship clinic. Higher odds of comfort were seen with lymphoma or ovarian cancer, > 15 years from diagnosis, and non-US government insurance. Lower odds were seen with melanoma, advanced stage, Medicaid insurance, and one late effect. Preference for PCP care was 87% for general health, 32% for recurrence monitoring, and 37% for late effect management. CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of cancer survivors were comfortable with PCP-led survivorship care and about half with a survivorship clinic. Most preferred oncologist care for recurrence monitoring and late-effect management. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Patient preference and comfort should be considered when developing survivorship care models. Future efforts should focus on facilitating patient-centered transitions to non-oncologist care.",2023,Oct,J Cancer Surviv,17,5,1327-1337,,10.1007/s11764-022-01177-0,35113306,#851,Attai 2023,,,0
Dietary Management of Eosinophilic Esophagitis.,Doerfler B; Lam AY; Gonsalves N,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune-mediated food antigen-driven disease characterized by tissue eosinophilia and clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction. Medical and dietary therapies can be offered as treatment options in both pediatric and adult populations. Advances in nutritional research in EoE have produced different levels of dietary restriction, ranging from elimination of a single food group to more extensive restriction such as the two-food elimination diet, four-food elimination diet, or six-food elimination diet. Efficacy and outcomes vary for each level of restriction. The option of using dietary therapy allows clinicians to partner with patients in shared decision-making to balance the right level of food antigen restriction for the desired outcome. Key considerations when choosing dietary therapy hinge on patient preference and resources, food-related quality of life, and the ability to provide nutritional diversity and maintain nutritional parameters. This article highlights these considerations and offers clinical pearls to guide clinicians who wish to incorporate dietary therapy of EoE into their practice.",2023,Nov,Gastroenterol Hepatol (N Y),19,11,680-690,,,38405222,#702,Doerfler 2023,,,0
Cervical preparation for second-trimester procedural abortion.,Fraz F; Liu SM; Shaw KA,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the evidence-informed options for cervical preparation prior to second-trimester dilation and evacuation (D&E). RECENT FINDINGS: As abortion restrictions increase and the number of abortion clinics and providers decreases, pregnant people are facing more barriers to abortion access. Those in need are now often required to travel for second-trimester abortion care, only to be faced with additional restrictions, such as mandatory waiting periods. Cervical preparation is recommended prior to D&E and takes time for effect. Given the increasing time required to obtain an abortion, patients and providers may prefer same-day cervical preparation to decrease the total time required. Options for same-day cervical preparation include misoprostol alone with single or serial doses, and misoprostol combined with osmotic dilators or transcervical balloon (Foley catheter). Same-day preparation may require additional clinical space to accommodate people after initiation of cervical preparation to manage side-effects and timing of the abortion. Overnight options are also used and more frequently later in the second trimester. Overnight options include mifepristone, osmotic dilators, and transcervical balloon and are often combined with same-day misoprostol. Medication alone preparation is well tolerated and effective in the second trimester, with the addition of mechanical methods with advancing gestation. With many options and combinations being safe and effective, providers can be dynamic and alter approach with supply shortages, adjust to different clinical settings, consider patient medical and surgical factors, and accommodate provider and patient preferences. SUMMARY: Multiple pharmacologic and mechanical options have been shown to be safe and effective for cervical preparation prior to D&E. Consideration for multiple factors should influence the method of cervical preparation and methods may vary by patient, provider and setting.",2023,Dec,Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol,35,6,470-475,,10.1097/GCO.0000000000000912,37678155,#626,Fraz 2023,,,0
Seborrheic keratosis.,Barthelmann S; Butsch F; Lang BM; Stege H; Großmann B; Schepler H; Grabbe S,"Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is the most common benign epidermal tumor in clinical dermatological practice. This review summarizes current knowledge about the clinical and histological appearance, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of SK. There are different subtypes of SK based on clinical presentation and histologic findings. Several factors, including age, genetic predisposition, and possibly also exposure to ultraviolet radiation, are thought to contribute to the development of SK. The lesions can occur on all areas of the body except for the palms and soles, but the most common sites are the face and upper trunk. The diagnosis is usually made clinically, and in some cases by dermatoscopy or histology. Many patients prefer to have the lesions removed for cosmetic reasons although there is no medical indication. Treatment options include surgical therapy, laser therapy, electrocautery, cryotherapy, and topical drug therapy, which is currently in development. Treatment should be individualized depending on the clinical picture and patient preference.",2023,Mar,J Dtsch Dermatol Ges,21,3,265-277,,10.1111/ddg.14984,36892019,#1430,Barthelmann 2023,,,0
"Exploring herbal remedy utilization for wound healing: Patterns, patient preferences, and implications for nursing practice.",Setyawati A; Yusuf S; Jafar N; Sagita RW,"PURPOSE: The utilization of herbal remedies for wound healing is a notable aspect of traditional medicine practices. Understanding herbal use among patients yields insights for nursing care enhancement. This study aimed to investigate the utilization of herbal remedies for wound healing among diabetic patients. METHODS: A total of 453 participants were enrolled, with demographic data, including age, sex, occupation, education level, residence, ethnic group, distance from health service, herbal use duration, and wound duration presented. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data, including means, standard deviations, ranges, and percentages. FINDINGS: The average participant age was 55.39 years, with most being non-civil servant workers (60.3%) and having a low education level (67.1%). Indian almond wood (9.7%) and green betel (6.8%) were the most commonly used herbs for wound healing. Family members were the primary source of information (29.1%), and 43.7% obtained herbs from personal gardens. Although 94.2% of participants did not disclose herbal use to health liaisons, 53.4% used herbs specifically for wound healing. Users reported both positive and negative effects on wounds from various herbs, indicating variability in experiences. However, the consistency of herb usage by individual patients was uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified diverse herbal remedies used for wound healing among patients, driven by familial recommendations. Usage pattern diversity and effects signal necessity for researching herb safety and efficacy. Clarifying the impact of consistent herb usage on wound healing is essential for understanding patients' preferences and practices. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: These findings emphasize the importance of open communication between patients and healthcare providers regarding herbal remedy use. Nurses should acknowledge patients' preferences for traditional healing practices while ensuring they receive evidence-based care. Patient-centered herbal strategies enhance nursing practice, fostering holistic wound care. Further research can guide nursing interventions, facilitate informed decision-making, and improve patient outcomes.",2023,Nov,Int J Nurs Knowl,,,,,10.1111/2047-3095.12454,38031257,#654,Setyawati 2023,,,0
Humanistic and Economic Burden of IgA Nephropathy: Systematic Literature Reviews and Narrative Synthesis.,Jhaveri KD; Bensink ME; Bunke M; Briggs JA; Cork DMW; Jeyabalan A,"BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is a progressive inflammatory kidney disease requiring long-term treatment to reduce the risk of progression to kidney failure. Here, we present two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) to identify and summarize literature reporting the humanistic and economic burden of IgAN. METHODS: Electronic literature databases (Ovid Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane) were searched for relevant literature on 29 November 2021, supplemented with gray literature searches. Studies reporting any health-related quality of life (HRQoL) or health state utility outcomes in IgAN patients were included in the humanistic impact SLR, and studies reporting the costs and healthcare resource utilization associated with or economic models of IgAN disease management were included in the economic burden SLR. Narrative synthesis was used to discuss the heterogeneous studies included in the SLRs. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines were followed, and all included studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Center for Evidence-Based Management tool for Critical Appraisal of a Survey or the Drummond Checklist. RESULTS: A total of 876 and 1122 references were identified from electronic and gray literature searches for humanistic and economic burden, respectively. Three studies reporting humanistic impact and five studies reporting economic burden met criteria for inclusion in these SLRs. The included humanistic studies reported patient preferences in the USA and China, HRQoL for patients with IgAN in Poland, and impact of exercise on HRQoL for patients with IgAN in China. The five economic studies reported costs of IgAN treatment in Canada, Italy, and China, along with two economic models from Japan. DISCUSSION: Current literature suggests IgAN is associated with substantial humanistic and economic burdens. However, these SLRs demonstrate the paucity of research conducted to specifically describe the humanistic or economic burden of IgAN and highlight the need for further research.",2023,Sep,Pharmacoecon Open,7,5,709-722,,10.1007/s41669-023-00415-0,37103750,#945,Jhaveri 2023,,,0
"Duration of Follow-up and Timing of Discharge from Imaging Follow-up, in Adult Patients with Urolithiasis After Surgical or Medical Intervention: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis from the European Association of Urology Guideline Panel on Urolithiasi",Tzelves L; Geraghty R; Lombardo R; Davis NF; Petřík A; Neisius A; Gambaro G; Türk C; Thomas K; Somani B; Skolarikos A,"CONTEXT: No algorithm exists for structured follow-up of urolithiasis patients. OBJECTIVE: To provide a discharge time point during follow-up of urolithiasis patients after treatment. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic review of PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, and reference lists according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. Fifty studies were eligible. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: From a pooled analysis of 5467 stone-free patients, we estimated that for a safety margin of 80% for remaining stone free, patients should be followed up using imaging, for at least 2 yr (radiopaque stones) or 3 yr (radiolucent stones) before being discharged. Patients should be discharged after 5 yr of no recurrence with a safety margin of 90%. Regarding residual disease, patients with fragments ≤4 mm could be offered surveillance up to 4 yr since intervention rates range between 17% and 29%, disease progression between 9% and 34%, and spontaneous passage between 21% and 34% at 49 mo. Patients with larger residual fragments should be offered further definitive intervention since intervention rates are high (24-100%). Insufficient data exist for high-risk patients, but the current literature dictates that patients who are adherent to targeted medical treatment seem to experience less stone growth or regrowth of residual fragments, and may be discharged after 36-48 mo of nonprogressive disease on imaging. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that stone-free patients with radiopaque or radiolucent stones should be followed up to 2 or 3 yr, respectively. In patients with residual fragments ≤4 mm, surveillance or intervention can be advised according to patient preferences and characteristics, while for those with larger residual fragments, reintervention should be scheduled. PATIENT SUMMARY: Here, we review the literature regarding follow-up of urolithiasis patients. Patients who have no stones after treatment should be seen up to 2-3 yr, those with large fragments should be reoperated, and those with small fragments could be offered surveillance with imaging.",2023,Jan,Eur Urol Focus,9,1,188-198,,10.1016/j.euf.2022.06.016,35851252,#1672,Tzelves 2023,,,0
The preferences of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis on riluzole treatment in Europe.,Ludolph AC; Grandjean H; Reviers E; De Micheli V; Bianchi C; Cardosi L; Russ H; Silani V,"The Patient Preference Survey aims to understand unmet needs related to riluzole management in people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and to identify which characteristics of a new formulation could better match their preferences. The survey involved 117 people with ALS (PALS) treated with riluzole in four European countries. The dysphagic PALS were least satisfied with the riluzole tablet and oral suspension and with ease in self-administration; up to 68% of respondents postponed or missed the treatment due to swallowing difficulties and need of caregiver assistance. Overall, 51% of tablet and 53% of oral suspension users regularly crushed or mixed riluzole with beverages, respectively; PALS who always manipulated riluzole showed low satisfaction with the formulation and considered the risk of choking and pneumonia the most worrisome event. The survey evaluated the driving factors in choosing/switching the therapy: 67% of PALS declared a low risk of choking. The research finally evaluated which attributes of a new formulation would be preferred: the most relevant were ease of use (4.3/5), convenient/portable packaging (4.0/5) and oral-dissolving properties without tongue motility (3.9/5). The Patient Preference Survey suggests that patients have several unmet needs and preferences that could be addressed by a different formulation, e.g. using oral film technologies.",2023,Dec,Sci Rep,13,1,22497,,10.1038/s41598-023-49424-3,38110502,#562,Ludolph 2023,,,0
Patient Preferences Regarding Surgical Treatment Methods for Symptomatic Uterine Fibroids.,Babalola O; Gebben D; Tarver ME; Sangha R; Roberts J; Price V,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to rank the factors that are most and least important to patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids when considering surgical treatment options. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a best worst scaling (BWS) preference elicitation approach, participants completed an online survey to rank factors associated with fibroid surgical treatments. Survey content was based on a literature review and included the following factors: symptom relief; surgical complications; repeat treatment; recovery time; cosmetic effects; risk of spreading undiagnosed cancer; sexual outcomes; maintenance of child-bearing; continuation of menses; unpredictable menses; and location of procedure. Participants completed 11 BWS tasks. For each task, we presented participants with a subset of 5 factors from the possible 11, and participants chose the most important and least important factor. Participants' responses were analyzed using conditional logistic regression to determine the relative importance of factors. Patient priorities were further explored via age and race. RESULTS: 285 respondents with symptomatic uterine fibroids (69 physician-confirmed and 216 self-reported) who had not undergone prior surgical treatment completed the survey. Respondents were enrolled from two clinical sites (clinical site cohort) and an online consumer panel (panel cohort). Both cohorts identified symptom relief, cancer risk, repeat treatment and complications as the most important factors in selecting surgical treatment options and location of procedure, return to normal activities after surgery, and cosmetic effects like presence of a scar after the surgical treatment as the least important factors. Of note, younger women (≤ 40) placed greater importance on the ability to have children after the procedure. CONCLUSION: Information regarding the factors most and least important to patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids might inform development and regulatory evaluation of new technologies and procedures. Study results may be useful in efforts to develop a set of outcomes to include in future fibroids clinical studies.",2023,Sep,Ther Innov Regul Sci,57,5,976-986,,10.1007/s43441-023-00525-1,37210440,#938,Babalola 2023,,,1
"Increased versus conventional adalimumab dose interval for patients with Crohn's disease in stable remission (LADI): a pragmatic, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial.",van Linschoten RCA; Jansen FM; Pauwels RWM; Smits LJT; Atsma F; Kievit W; de Jong DJ; de Vries AC; Boekema PJ; West RL; Bodelier AGL; Gisbertz IAM; Wolfhagen FHJ; Römkens TEH; Lutgens MWMD; van Bodegraven AA; Oldenburg B; Pierik MJ; Russel MGVM; de Boer NK; Mallant-Hent RC; Ter Borg PCJ; van der Meulen-de Jong AE; Jansen JM; Jansen SV; Tan ACITL; van der Woude CJ; Hoentjen F,"BACKGROUND: Despite its effectiveness in treating Crohn's disease, adalimumab is associated with an increased risk of infections and high health-care costs. We aimed to assess clinical outcomes of increased adalimumab dose intervals versus conventional dosing in patients with Crohn's disease in stable remission. METHODS: The LADI study was a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority, parallel, randomised controlled trial, done in six academic hospitals and 14 general hospitals in the Netherlands. Adults (aged ≥18 years) diagnosed with luminal Crohn's disease (with or without concomitant perianal disease) were eligible when in steroid-free clinical and biochemical remission (defined as Harvey-Bradshaw Index [HBI] score <5, faecal calprotectin <150 μg/g, and C-reactive protein <10 mg/L) for at least 9 months on a stable dose of 40 mg subcutaneous adalimumab every 2 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to the intervention group or control group by the coordinating investigator using a secure web-based system with variable block randomisation (block sizes of 6, 9, and 12). Randomisation was stratified on concomitant use of thiopurines and methotrexate. Patients and health-care providers were not masked to group assignment. Patients allocated to the intervention group increased adalimumab dose intervals to 40 mg every 3 weeks at baseline and further to every 4 weeks if they remained in clinical and biochemical remission at week 24. Patients in the control group continued their 2-weekly dose interval. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of persistent flares at week 48 defined as the presence of at least two of the following criteria: HBI score of 5 or more, C-reactive protein 10 mg/L or more, and faecal calprotectin more than 250 μg/g for more than 8 weeks and a concurrent decrease in the adalimumab dose interval or start of escape medication. The non-inferiority margin was 15% on a risk difference scale. All analyses were done in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03172377, and is not recruiting. FINDINGS: Between May 3, 2017, and July 6, 2020, 174 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n=113) or the control group (n=61). Four patients from the intervention group and one patient from the control group were excluded from the analysis for not meeting inclusion criteria. 85 (50%) of 169 participants were female and 84 (50%) were male. At week 48, the cumulative incidence of persistent flares in the intervention group (three [3%] of 109) was non-inferior compared with the control group (zero; pooled adjusted risk difference 1·86% [90% CI -0·35 to 4·07). Seven serious adverse events occurred, all in the intervention group, of which two (both patients with intestinal obstruction) were possibly related to the intervention. Per 100 person-years, 168·35 total adverse events, 59·99 infection-related adverse events, and 42·57 gastrointestinal adverse events occurred in the intervention group versus 134·67, 75·03, and 5·77 in the control group, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The individual benefit of increasing adalimumab dose intervals versus the risk of disease recurrence is a trade-off that should take patient preferences regarding medication and the risk of a flare into account.

Patient-Centered Quality Measures for Dialysis Care: A Report of a Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Scientific Workshop Sponsored by the National Kidney Foundation.,Weiner DE; Delgado C; Flythe JE; Forfang DL; Manley T; McGonigal LJ; McNamara E; Murphy H; Roach JL; Watnick SG; Weinhandl E; Willis K; Berns JS,"Providing high-quality patient-centered care is the central mission of dialysis facilities. Assessing quality and patient-centeredness of dialysis care is necessary for continuous dialysis facility improvement. Based predominantly on readily measured items, current quality measures in dialysis care emphasize biochemical and utilization outcomes, with very few patient-reported items. Additionally, current metrics often do not account for patient preferences and may compromise patient-centered care by limiting the ability of providers to individualize care targets, such as dialysis adequacy, based on patient priorities rather than a fixed numerical target. Developing, implementing, and maintaining a quality program using readily quantifiable data while also allowing for individualization of care targets that emphasize the goals of patients and their care partners provided the motivation for a September 2022 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Workshop on Patient-Centered Quality Measures for Dialysis Care. Workshop participants focused on 4 questions: (1) What are the outcomes that are most important to patients and their care partners? (2) How can social determinants of health be accounted for in quality measures? (3) How can individualized care be effectively addressed in population-level quality programs? (4) What are the optimal means for collecting valid and robust patient-reported outcome data? Workshop participants identified numerous gaps within the current quality system and favored a conceptually broader, but not larger, quality system that stresses highly meaningful and adaptive measures that incorporate patient-centered principles, individual life goals, and social risk factors. Workshop participants also identified a need for new, low-burden tools to assess patient goals and priorities.",2023,Nov,Am J Kidney Dis,,,,,10.1053/j.ajkd.2023.09.015,37972814,#685,Weiner 2023,,,0
Centering patient perspectives to achieve injury-related health equity in trauma care systems: Improving trauma registry data.,Conrick KM; Mills B; St Vil C; Dotolo D; Solano E; Bulger EM; Arbabi S; Herrenkohl M; Vavilala MS; Rowhani-Rahbar A; Moore M,"BACKGROUND: Limitations in current data collection systems for patients who experience traumatic injury limit researchers' ability to identify and address disparities in injury and outcomes. We sought to develop and test a patient-centered data-collection system for equity-related data indicators that was acceptable to racially and ethnically diverse patients being treated for traumatic injuries. METHODS: Health equity indicators included in this study were race and ethnicity, language, education, employment, housing, and injury address. We conducted interviews with 245 racially and ethnically diverse trauma patients who were treated at a level-1 trauma center in the US in 2019-2020. We first interviewed 136 patients to develop a culturally resonant process and options for the health equity indicators to be added to a revised data collection system for the electronic medical record. English and Spanish interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim; qualitative analysis was used to assess patient preferences. We then pilot tested the revised data collection system with an additional 109 trauma patients to assess acceptability. Acceptability was defined as having more than 95% of participants self-identify with one of the proposed options for race/ethnicity, language, education, employment, and housing. Injury address (to identify geographic disparities) was pre-defined as acceptable if at least 85% of participants could identify exact address, cross streets, a landmark or business, or zip code of injury. RESULTS: A revised data collection system, including culturally resonant indicators and a process to be used by patient registrars to collect health equity data, was pilot tested, refined, and considered acceptable. Culturally resonant question phrasing/answer options for race/ethnicity, language, education, employment, housing status, and injury address were identified as acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a patient-centered data collection system for health equity measures with racially and ethnically diverse patients who have experienced traumatic injury. This system has the potential to increase data quality and accuracy, which is critical to quality improvement efforts and for researchers seeking to identify groups most impacted by racism and other structural barriers to equitable health outcomes and effective intervention points.",2023,Sep,Injury,54,9,110847,,10.1016/j.injury.2023.110847,37301651,#933,Conrick 2023,,,0
Satisfaction and preferences among patients with both implant-supported single crown and tooth-supported fixed dental prosthesis: a pilot study.,Thieu MKL; Mauland EK; Verket A,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess patient-reported preferences and outcomes in patients rehabilitated with both an implant-supported single crown (ISC) and a tooth-supported fixed dental prosthesis (FDP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The electronic journal system at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Oslo, was searched to find patients presenting both an ISC and an FDP replacing no more than two teeth between abutments. Identified patients that agreed answered a questionnaire followed by a clinical examination. Descriptive statistics was calculated. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included. The mean function time was 11.8 years for FDPs and 6.6 years for ISCs. All but three patients were satisfied with both rehabilitation modalities. No patients were unsatisfied with aesthetics or function of either rehabilitation. All patients reported satisfactory function of their restorations and reported chewing without problems. The self-reported post-operative complications were few, but less than observed in the clinical examinations. CONCLUSIONS: More patients reported food impaction with their FDP as compared to their ISC.

Practices and Views of US Oncologists and Genetic Counselors Regarding Patient Recontact After Variant Reclassification: Results of a Nationwide Survey.,Makhnoon S; Davidson E; Shirts B; Arun B; Shete S,"PURPOSE: Over a 5-year or 10-year period, between 6% and 15% of germline cancer genetic variants undergo reclassification. Up-to-date interpretation can clarify a variant's clinical significance and guide patient management. As the frequency of reclassifications increase, the issue of whether, how, when, and which providers should recontact patients with information about reclassification becomes important. However, the field lacks research evidence and definitive guidance from professional organizations about how providers should recontact patients. We compared the perspectives of US oncologists and cancer genetic counselors (GCs) to describe their practices and views regarding recontact. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a survey using themes identified from semistructured interviews with oncologists and GCs and administered it in a national sample of oncologists and GCs between July and September 2022. RESULTS: In total, 634 respondents completed the survey including 349 oncologists and 285 GCs. On frequency of recontacting patients with reclassified results, 40% of GCs reported recontacting often compared with 12.5% of oncologists. Neither group reported recording patient preference for recontact on electronic medical record (EMR). Both groups agreed that all reclassified variants, even those that do not affect clinical management, should be returned to patients. They also reported that recontact via EMR messages, mailed letters, and phone calls from GC assistants were more suitable for downgrades. By contrast, face-to-face meetings and phone calls were preferred for upgrades. Remarkably, oncologists were more likely to endorse face-to-face return of results and were more likely to endorse return through a nongenetics provider compared to GCs. CONCLUSION: These data on current recontact practices and opinions provide a foundation for developing guidelines with explicit recommendations on patient recontact that can help maximize clinical effect while considering provider preferences for recontact within resource-constrained genomic practice settings.",2023,Jun,JCO Precis Oncol,7,,e2300079,,10.1200/PO.23.00079,37384863,#1176,Makhnoon 2023,,,0
Conflicting attitudes between clinicians and women regarding maternal requested caesarean section: a qualitative evidence synthesis.,Johansson M; Alvan J; Pettersson A; Hildingsson I,"BACKGROUND: Caesarean section (CS) can be a life-saving operation but might also negatively affect the health of both the woman and the baby. The aim of this study was to synthesize and contrast women's and clinicians' attitudes toward maternal-requested CS, and their experiences of the decision-making process around CS. METHODS: The databases of CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycInfo and Scopus were screened. All qualitative studies that answered the study question and that were assessed to have minor or moderate methodological limitations were included. Synthesised findings were assessed using GRADE-CERQual. RESULTS: The Qualitative Evidence Synthesis included 14 qualitative studies (published 2000-2022), involving 242 women and 141 clinicians. From the women's perspectives, two themes arose: women regarded CS as the safest mode of birth; and women's rights to receive support and acceptance for a CS request. From the clinicians' perspectives, four themes emerged: clinicians were concerned about health risks associated with CS; demanding experience to consult women with a CS request; conflicting attitudes about women's rights to choose a CS; and the importance of respectful and constructive dialogue about birthing options. CONCLUSION: Women and clinicians often had different perceptions regarding the right of a woman to choose CS, the risks associated with CS, and the kind of support that should be part of the decision-making process. While women expected to receive acceptance for their CS request, clinicians perceived that their role was to support the woman in the decision-making process through consultation and discussion. While clinicians thought it was important to show respect for a woman's birth preferences, they also felt the need to resist a woman's request for CS and encourage her to give birth vaginally due to the associated increases in health risks.",2023,Mar,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,23,1,210,,10.1186/s12884-023-05471-2,36978038,#1397,Johansson 2023,,,0
Patient preferences regarding treatment options for Waldenström's macroglobulinemia: A discrete choice experiment.,Amaador K; Nieuwkerk PT; Minnema MC; Kersten MJ; Vos JMI,"INTRODUCTION: Treatment options for Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM) have expanded rapidly in the last decades. However, there is no consensus on a preferred treatment. Therefore, patient preferences become increasingly important in making individualized treatment plans. Still, WM patients' priorities and perspectives regarding their treatment options are unknown. We evaluated treatment preferences of WM patients using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). METHODS: A mixed-method approach was utilized for identification and selection of attributes/levels. The DCE questionnaire included five attributes: type of agent (targeted versus chemotherapy); frequency and route of administration; 5-year progression-free survival (PFS); adverse events; and risk of secondary malignancies. An orthogonal design and a mixed logit panel data model were used to construct choice tasks and assess patient preferences, respectively. RESULTS: Three hundred thirty WM patients participated in the project. In total, 214 (65%) complete questionnaires were included for data analysis. The 5-year PFS, followed by risk of secondary malignancies were the most important attributes for making treatment choices. Regarding side effects, patients chose to avoid neuropathy the most compared to nausea/vomiting and extreme fatigue. Patients preferred a fixed-duration treatment with IV/SC administration at the hospital over a continuous daily oral regimen at home. CONCLUSION: These are the first systematic data obtained on WM patient preferences for treatment. The results may help discussions with individual patients about their treatment choices. Also, these data can help design clinical trials in WM and inform health-care decision-making regarding outcomes that are most relevant to patients.",2023,Feb,Cancer Med,12,3,3376-3386,,10.1002/cam4.5080,35880731,#1570,Amaador 2023,,,1
A 10-year follow-up of reproductive outcomes in women attempting motherhood after elective oocyte cryopreservation.,Loreti S; Darici E; Nekkebroeck J; Drakopoulos P; Van Landuyt L; De Munck N; Tournaye H; De Vos M,"STUDY QUESTION: Which reproductive treatment outcomes are observed in women who underwent elective oocyte cryopreservation (EOC) and who returned to the clinic with a desire for a child? SUMMARY ANSWER: Whether to warm oocytes or to first use fresh own oocytes for ART depends on age upon returning, but both strategies result in favorable reproductive outcomes. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Most affluent countries have observed a trend toward postponement of childbearing, and EOC is increasingly used based on the assumption that oocytes cryopreserved at a younger age may extend a woman's reproductive lifespan and mitigate her age-related fertility decline. Although most follow-up studies after EOC have focused on women who requested oocyte warming, a substantial proportion of women who do not conceive naturally will embark on fertility treatment without using their cryopreserved oocytes. Reports on reproductive outcomes in past EOC users are scarce, and the lack of reproductive treatment algorithms in this group of women hampers counseling toward the most efficient clinical strategy. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This retrospective observational single-center study encompasses 843 women who had elective oocyte vitrification between 2009 and 2019 at our fertility clinic. Women who underwent fertility preservation for medical or oncological reasons were excluded. This study describes the outcomes of the diverse reproductive treatment strategies performed until May 2022 in women returning to our clinic to attempt motherhood. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Using descriptive statistics, patient characteristics and data of ovarian stimulation (OS) of EOC cycles were analyzed, as well as data related to OS and laboratory data of ART in women who pursued fertility treatment with and/or without using their cryopreserved oocytes. The primary outcome was live birth rate (LBR) per patient after oocyte warming and after ART using fresh oocytes. Secondary outcomes were return rate, utilization rate of the cryopreserved oocytes, laboratory outcomes upon return, and LBR per embryo transfer. A multivariable regression model was developed to identify factors associated with the decision to thaw oocytes as the primary strategy and factors associated with ongoing pregnancy upon return to the clinic. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 1353 EOC cycles (mean ± SD, 1.6 ± 0.9 per patient) were performed. At the time of EOC, the mean age was 36.5 ± 2.8 years, mean anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) was 2.3 ± 2.0 ng/ml, and 174 (20.6%) women had a partner. On average, 13.9 ± 9.2 mature oocytes were cryopreserved. Two hundred thirty-one (27.4%) women returned to the clinic, an average of 39.9 ± 23.4 months after EOC. Upon returning, their mean age was 40.4 ± 3.1 years, mean AMH was 1.5 ± 1.5 ng/ml, and 158/231 (68.3%) patients had a partner. As a primary approach, 110/231 (47.6%) past EOC users embarked on oocyte warming, 50/231 (21.6%) had intrauterine insemination, and 71/231 (30.7%) had ART using fresh own oocytes. Cumulative LBR (CLBR) was 45.9% (106/231) notwithstanding a miscarriage rate (MR) of 30.7% (51/166) in the entire cohort. In total, 141 women performed oocyte warming at some stage in their treatment trajectory. A subset of 90/231 (39.0%) patients exclusively had oocyte warming (41.6 ± 3.0 years, with 10.0 ± 5.2 oocytes warmed per patient). 52/231 (22.5%) patients exclusively had ART using fresh own oocytes (mean age of 39.0 ± 2.8 years, with 9.9 ± 7.4 mature oocytes retrieved per patient). CLBR was 37/90 (41.1%) in the oocyte warming-only group and 25/52 (48.1%) in the OS-only group. MR/transfer was 25.0% and 29.3% in the oocyte warming-only group and the OS-only group, respectively. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Both sample size and the retrospective design are limitations of this study. The decision to embark on a specific reproductive treatment strategy was based on patient preference, after counseling on their treatment options. This precludes direct comparison of the efficiency of reproductive treatment options in past EOC users in this study. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Reporting on clinical outcomes of women who underwent EOC and returned to the clinic to embark on divergent reproductive treatment strategies is mandatory to establish guidelines for best clinical practice in this growing patient population.

Preoperative Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging: An Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario) Clinical Practice Guideline.,Muradali D; Fletcher GG; Cordeiro E; Fienberg S; George R; Kulkarni S; Seely JM; Shaheen R; Eisen A,"BACKGROUND: The use of preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after the diagnosis of breast cancer by mammography and/or ultrasound is inconsistent. METHODS: After conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing preoperative breast MRI versus no MRI, we reconvened to prepare a clinical practice guideline on this topic. RESULTS: Based on the evidence that MRI improved recurrence, decreased the rates of reoperations (re-excisions or conversion mastectomy), and increased detection of synchronous contralateral breast cancer, we recommend that preoperative breast MRI should be considered on a case-by-case basis in patients diagnosed with breast cancer for whom additional information about disease extent could influence treatment. Based on stronger evidence, preoperative breast MRI is recommended in patients diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma for whom additional information about disease extent could influence treatment. For both recommendations, the decision to proceed with MRI would be conditional on shared decision-making between care providers and the patient, taking into account the benefits and risks of MRI as well as patient preferences. Based on the opinion of the Working Group, preoperative breast MRI is also recommended in the following more specific situations: (a) to aid in surgical planning of breast conserving surgery in patients with suspected or known multicentric or multifocal disease; (b) to identify additional lesions in patients with dense breasts; (c) to determine the presence of pectoralis major muscle/chest wall invasion in patients with posteriorly located tumours or when invasion of the pectoralis major muscle or chest wall is suspected; (d) to aid in surgical planning for skin/nipple-sparing mastectomies, autologous reconstruction, oncoplastic surgery, and breast conserving surgery with suspected nipple/areolar involvement; and (e) in patients with familial/hereditary breast cancer but who have not had recent breast MRI as part of screening or diagnosis.",2023,Jun,Curr Oncol,30,7,6255-6270,,10.3390/curroncol30070463,37504323,#1143,Muradali 2023,,,0
The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Ulcerative Colitis: Results from a Global Ulcerative Colitis Narrative Patient Survey.,Peyrin-Biroulet L; Ylänne K; Sipes A; Segovia M; Gardiner S; Cappelleri JC; Mulvey A; Panaccione R,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created challenges related to disease management of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The UC Narrative COVID-19 survey was conducted from August to December 2021 among adults with UC from the United States, Canada, Japan, France, and Finland. Patients were questioned on disease management, health care access and experience, and preferences for interactions with their doctor. Data were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: In total, 584 patients qualified for and completed the survey. Compared with 2019, 25% experienced more flares during the pandemic (from early 2020). Most patients (88%) taking prescription medication were very/somewhat satisfied with their current treatment plan; 53% were hesitant to make changes during the pandemic. Factors that patients agreed helped control UC symptoms during the pandemic included fewer social outings (37%), working from home (29%), and less busy schedules (28%). Greater anxiety/stress (43%) and hesitancy to visit a hospital/office (34%) made the control of UC symptoms more difficult. Compared with 2019, more patients relied on certain alternative support systems during the pandemic. Patients who used in-person and virtual appointments were equally very satisfied/satisfied with the quality of care (both 81%). In-person appointments were preferred by 68% of patients when meeting a new doctor, 55% when experiencing a flare, and 52% for regular check-ups; 41% preferred virtual appointments for UC prescription refills. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, most patients were satisfied with their current UC treatment plan and access to care; more patients relied on certain alternative UC management support systems, and many were impacted by anxiety/stress.",2024,Feb,Adv Ther,41,2,598-617,,10.1007/s12325-023-02673-0,38048018,#422,Peyrin-Biroulet 2024,,,0
"A Randomized, Prospective, Observer-Masked Study Comparing Dropless Treatment Regimen Using Intracanalicular Dexamethasone Insert, Intracameral Ketorolac, and Intracameral Moxifloxacin versus Conventional Topical Therapy to Control Postoperative Pain and ",Donnenfeld ED; Hovanesian JA; Malik AG; Wong A,"PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical efficacy and patient preference for a dropless treatment regimen compared to conventional topical therapy in patients undergoing cataract surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective, contralateral eye study, patients with bilateral cataract were randomized to receive either intracanalicular dexamethasone insert, intracameral phenylephrine 1%/ketorolac 0.3%, and intracameral moxifloxacin (50 µg) (study group) or topical moxifloxacin 0.5%, ketorolac 0.5%, and prednisolone acetate 1.0% QID (control group). The second eye underwent cataract surgery 2 weeks later and was treated with the opposite treatment. All patients were evaluated at Days 1, 7, 14, 28, and 3 months. The primary outcome measure was postoperative ocular pain. Secondary outcomes included summed ocular inflammation score (SOIS; the sum of the mean anterior chamber cells and anterior flare score), the patient preference for medication protocol between the two eyes, and patient out-of-pocket cost of medications. Safety outcome measures included CDVA, intraocular pressure, central retinal thickness (CRT), and the incidence of reported AEs. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with no pain was similar in both groups at all postoperative visits (p>0.05). No statistically significant difference in SOIS score was observed between the two groups at any visit. A strong majority of the patients (94.7%) preferred the study eye's dropless regimen over the control eye's conventional topical therapy regimen. No statistically significant difference in mean intraocular pressure (IOP) was observed at any postoperative visit, except at Week 1. The mean CDVA was also similar in both groups at all postoperative visits (p>0.05). The postoperative mean CRT was comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION: A dropless treatment regimen is as effective as topical eyedrop administration. A higher proportion of patients who underwent bilateral cataract surgery preferred the dropless treatment regimen over the patient-administered eye drop regimen.",2023,,Clin Ophthalmol,17,,2349-2356,,10.2147/OPTH.S422502,37600148,#975,Donnenfeld 2023,,,0
The Role of Nurse on the Treatment Decision Support for Older People with Cancer: A Systematic Review.,Komatsu H; Komatsu Y,"Background: The number of older adults with cancer is increasing worldwide. The role of nurses in supporting patients' decision-making is expanding, as this process is fraught with complexity and uncertainty due to comorbidities, frailty, cognitive decline, etc., in older adults with cancer. The aim of this review was to examine the contemporary roles of oncology nurses in the treatment decision-making process in older adults with cancer. Methods: A systematic review of PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Results: Of the 3029 articles screened, 56 full texts were assessed for eligibility, and 13 were included in the review. We identified three themes regarding nurses' roles in the decision-making process for older adults with cancer: accurate geriatric assessments, provision of available information, and advocacy. Nurses conduct geriatric assessments to identify geriatric syndromes, provide appropriate information, elicit patient preferences, and communicate efficiently with patients and caregivers, promoting physicians. Time constraints were cited as a barrier to fulfilling nurses' roles. Conclusions: The role of nurses is to elicit patients' broader health and social care needs to facilitate patient-centered decision-making, respecting their preferences and values. Further research focusing on the role of nurses that considers diverse cancer types and healthcare systems is needed.",2023,Feb,Healthcare (Basel),11,4,,,10.3390/healthcare11040546,36833079,#1518,Komatsu 2023,,,0
The art of diabetes care: guidelines for a holistic approach to human and social factors.,Hashim MJ,"A holistic approach to diabetes considers patient preferences, emotional health, living conditions, and other contextual factors, in addition to medication selection. Human and social factors influence treatment adherence and clinical outcomes. Social issues, cost of care, out-of-pocket expenses, pill burden (number and frequency), and injectable drugs such as insulin, can affect adherence. Clinicians can ask about these contextual factors when discussing treatment options with patients. Patients' emotional health can also affect diabetes self-care. Social stressors such as family issues may impair self-care behaviors. Diabetes can also lead to emotional stress. Diabetes distress correlates with worse glycemic control and lower overall well-being. Patient-centered communication can build the foundation of a trusting relationship with the clinician. Respect for patient preferences and fears can build trust. Relevant communication skills include asking open-ended questions, expressing empathy, active listening, and exploring the patient's perspective. Glycemic goals must be personalized based on frailty, the risk of hypoglycemia, and healthy life expectancy. Lifestyle counseling requires a nonjudgmental approach and tactfulness. The art of diabetes care rests on clinicians perceiving a patient's emotional state.

Designing Clinical MRI for Enhanced Workflow and Value.,Lin DJ; Doshi AM; Fritz J; Recht MP,"MRI is an expensive and traditionally time-intensive modality in imaging. With the paradigm shift toward value-based healthcare, radiology departments must examine the entire MRI process cycle to identify opportunities to optimize efficiency and enhance value for patients. Digital tools such as ""frictionless scheduling"" prioritize patient preference and convenience, thereby delivering patient-centered care. Recent advances in conventional and deep learning-based accelerated image reconstruction methods have reduced image acquisition time to such a degree that so-called nongradient time now constitutes a major percentage of total room time. For this reason, architectural design strategies that reconfigure patient preparation processes and decrease the turnaround time between scans can substantially impact overall throughput while also improving patient comfort and privacy. Real-time informatics tools that provide an enterprise-wide overview of MRI workflow and Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS)-integrated instant messaging can complement these efforts by offering transparent, situational data and facilitating communication between radiology team members. Finally, long-term investment in training, recruiting, and retaining a highly skilled technologist workforce is essential for building a pipeline and team of technologists committed to excellence. Here, we highlight various opportunities for optimizing MRI workflow and enhancing value by offering many of our own on-the-ground experiences and conclude by anticipating some of the future directions for process improvement and innovation in clinical MR imaging.

Updates in the Treatment of Non-Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer: The Benefit of Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Antagonists.,Hadfield MJ; Lyall V; Holle LM; Dennison M,"OBJECTIVE: To review pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and considerations for use, of second-generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonists in treatment of nonmetastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (M0CRPC). DATA SOURCES: Conducted search in PubMed and Google scholar (January, 1, 2002-December 31, 2022), using relevant terms. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant English-language studies, conducted in humans evaluating second-generation AR antagonists for M0CRPC, and additional articles and package inserts were considered. DATA SYNTHESIS: Apalutamide, darolutamide, and enzalutamide are effective in delaying the time to development of metastatic prostate cancer in men with M0CRPC with a rapid prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time (<10 months). No head-to-head, randomized, clinical trials have been conducted. The most common adverse effects include fatigue and hypertension, and quality of life is maintained in most patients. Cost is similar among the agents (~$15,000/month). Drug-drug interactions vary among these agents and should be considered, when selecting therapy as well as likely adherence. Darolutamide is administered twice daily with the others once daily. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: Second-generation AR antagonists are effective in reducing time to development of metastatic disease and prolonging overall survival in patients with M0CRPC and a PSA doubling time of <10 months. Recent imaging advances may alter how we evaluate outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Second-generation AR antagonists improve disease control and overall survival. Generally, they are well tolerated and QOL is maintained. Selection of the best agent is based on the adverse effect profile, potential for drug- and disease-interactions, administration, cost, and patient preference.",2023,Nov,Ann Pharmacother,57,11,1302-1311,,10.1177/10600280231155441,36840339,#748,Hadfield 2023,,,0
Identifying Patterns in Preoperative Communication about High-Risk Surgical Intervention: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.,Stalter LN; Baggett ND; Hanlon BM; Buffington A; Kalbfell EL; Zelenski AB; Arnold RM; Clapp JT; Schwarze ML,"INTRODUCTION: Surgeons are entrusted with providing patients with information necessary for deliberation about surgical intervention. Ideally, surgical consultations generate a shared understanding of the treatment experience and determine whether surgery aligns with a patient's overall health goals. In-depth assessment of communication patterns might reveal opportunities to better achieve these objectives. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of audio-recorded consultations between surgeons and patients considering high-risk surgery. For 43 surgeons, we randomly selected 4 transcripts each of consultations with patients aged ≥60 y with at least 1 comorbidity. We developed a coding taxonomy, based on principles of informed consent and shared decision making, to categorize surgeon speech. We grouped transcripts by treatment plan and recorded the treatment goal. We used box plots, Sankey diagrams, and flow diagrams to characterize communication patterns. RESULTS: We included 169 transcripts, of which 136 discussed an oncologic problem and 33 considered a vascular (including cardiac and neurovascular) problem. At the median, surgeons devoted an estimated 8 min (interquartile range 5-13 min) to content specifically about intervention including surgery. In 85.5% of conversations, more than 40% of surgeon speech was consumed by technical descriptions of the disease or treatment. ""Fix-it"" language was used in 91.7% of conversations. In 79.9% of conversations, no overall goal of treatment was established or only a desire to cure or control cancer was expressed. Most conversations (68.6%) began with an explanation of the disease, followed by explanation of the treatment in 53.3%, and then options in 16.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Explanation of disease and treatment dominate surgical consultations, with limited time spent on patient goals. Changing the focus of these conversations may better support patients' deliberation about the value of surgery.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02623335. HIGHLIGHTS: In decision-making conversations about high-risk surgical intervention, surgeons emphasize description of the patient's disease and potential treatment, and the use of ""fix-it"" language is common.Surgeons dedicated limited time to eliciting patient preferences and goals, and 79.9% of conversations resulted in no explicit goal of treatment.Current communication practices may be inadequate to support deliberation about the value of surgery for individual patients and their families.",2023,May,Med Decis Making,43,4,487-497,ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02623335,10.1177/0272989X231164142,37036062,#1272,Stalter 2023,,,0
The best defence is a good offence: Ensuring equitable access to primary care in Canada.,Hedden L; McGrail K,"Ensuring access to primary care is a persistent challenge in Canada, and the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing gaps. Public policy reform that only partially addresses these access issues, technological opportunities, workforce desires, or patient preferences creates an opportunity for private, investor-owned corporations to take ownership of primary care delivery systems. This article summarizes the history of the ""public-private"" conversation as it pertains to primary care, with a particular focus on investor-owned corporations. We outline how profit-driven, corporate healthcare impacts equitable access to care, increases spending on low-value services, and undermines the underlying values of Canadian healthcare systems. All of healthcare delivery requires rapid regulation and oversight by policy-makers, which would increase transparency of corporate care. There also must be parallel efforts placed on addressing the long-standing issues in publicly funded delivery of primary care that created the space for corporate care to grow.",2023,Sep,Healthc Manage Forum,36,5,293-298,,10.1177/08404704231182260,37500185,#911,Hedden 2023,,,0
Assessment of neophallus length following metoidioplasty.,Glick H; Tang M; Daignault-Newton S; Hadj-Moussa M,"BACKGROUND: An increasing number of gender diverse individuals are presenting for gender affirming care. An option for genital gender affirming surgery (gGAS) in transmasculine individuals is metoidioplasty, creating a small neophallus from enlarged clitoral tissue following prolonged testosterone exposure. The goal of this study is to understand factors which contribute to greater exposed neophallus length following metoidioplasty. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review on patients presenting to a single academic institution who underwent a metoidioplasty. All operations were performed using the Belgrade technique with or without urethral lengthening depending on patient preference. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients underwent metoidioplasty from 2017-2022. Sixteen had recorded stretched clitoral length (pre-operatively) and exposed neophallus length (post-operatively). The median length of time on testosterone therapy was 4.6 years. The median stretched clitoral length was 5.8 cm, and exposed neophallus length was 6 cm. There was a strong correlation between pre-operative length and post-operative length (ρ=0.9; P<0.0001). There were no correlations between pre-operative length or exposed neophallus length and BMI (ρ=-0.02, P=0.93; ρ=0.05, P=0.83, respectively). Time on testosterone does not correlate with stretched clitoral length nor exposed neophallus length (ρ=-0.28, P=0.15; ρ=-0.35, P=0.18, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients considering metoidioplasty often wonder how large their neophallus will be. We found that patients can expect exposed neophallus length to be about 0.6 cm longer than their pre-operative stretched clitoral length. No evidence of association of time on testosterone nor BMI with exposed neophallus length was found. This information is crucial for gender diverse patients to make informed decisions about gGAS.",2023,Sep,Transl Androl Urol,12,9,1390-1396,,10.21037/tau-23-155,37814700,#853,Glick 2023,,,0
Decision Making About Disease-Modifying Treatments for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis: Stated Preferences and Real-World Choices.,Webb EJD; Meads D; Eskytė I; Ford HL; Bekker HL; Chataway J; Pepper G; Marti J; Okan Y; Pavitt SH; Schmierer K; Manzano A,"BACKGROUND: People with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis can benefit from disease-modifying treatments (DMTs). Several DMTs are available that vary in their efficacy, side-effect profile and mode of administration. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to measure the preferences of people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis for DMTs using a discrete choice experiment and to assess which stated preference attributes correlate with the attributes of the DMTs they take in the real world. METHODS: Discrete choice experiment attributes were developed from literature reviews, interviews and focus groups. In a discrete choice experiment, participants were shown two hypothetical DMTs, then chose whether they preferred one of the DMTs or no treatment. A mixed logit model was estimated from responses and individual-level estimates of participants' preferences conditional on their discrete choice experiment choices calculated. Logit models were estimated with stated preferences predicting current real-world on-treatment status, DMT mode of administration and current DMT. RESULTS: A stated intrinsic preference for taking a DMT was correlated with currently taking a DMT, and stated preferences for mode of administration were correlated with the modes of administration of the DMTs participants were currently taking. Stated preferences for treatment effectiveness and adverse effects were not correlated with real-world behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: There was variation in which discrete choice experiment attributes correlated with participants' real-world DMT choices. This may indicate patient preferences for treatment efficacy/risk are not adequately taken account of in prescribing.

"Completing the time trade-off with respondents who are older, in poorer health or with an immigrant background in an EQ-5D-5L valuation study.",Hansen TM; Stavem K; Rand K,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of age, immigrant background, and poor self-reported health in a general population sample on the probability of non-completion or slow completion of the time trade-off (TTO). METHODS: We used data from an interrupted Norwegian EQ-5D-5L valuation study conducted between 2019 and 2020. All participants responded to background items, irrespective of completion. We used mixed effect logistic regression analysis to assess the effect of old age, poor health, and immigrant background on the probability of non-completion of the TTO, and, for those who completed the TTO, of slow completion times. RESULTS: First experiences from a Norwegian valuation study were that 29 (5.5%) respondents failed to complete the TTO tasks. For those reporting age over 65 years, poor health, or an immigrant background, 12% failed to complete the TTO. Adjusted odds ratios for predictors of non-completion were statistically significant (age > 65 years, 8.3; EQ-VAS ≤ 50, 3.49; immigrant background, 4.56). Being over 65 years or with an immigrant background also predicted slow completion of both the introduction and TTO tasks. CONCLUSIONS: High age, poor health, and immigrant status increased the risk of not being able to complete the TTO tasks, and of slow completion. Higher non-completion rates and increased completion times suggest that elements of the TTO may be demanding for some respondent groups, with possible implications for representativeness.",2023,Aug,Eur J Health Econ,24,6,877-884,,10.1007/s10198-022-01517-y,36053383,#1034,Hansen 2023,,,0
Eligibility test for advanced chronic kidney disease: Revision and proposal.,García Agudo R; Méndez Molina M; Piqueras Sánchez S; Tejera-Muñoz A,"Nowadays, chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence keeps increasing worldwide. The management of these patients usually requires renal replacement therapy (RRT). However, the complexity of patients' profiles comprises a great challenge to overcome. During the last decades, CKD units have been developed to offer multidisciplinary and coordinated attention to patients, helping in the decision-making of the RRT. Nevertheless, there is a huge variability in the performance and organization of care practice, implying an existing necessity to homogenize the RRT modality chosen. We propose a test composed of two parts: one to be completed by the medical staff (to evaluate contraindications for the different RRT techniques) and another by the patient or nursing staff (to consider patients' preferences). In this sense, it would be possible to have a common and useful tool to complement patient education in RRT, as well as sharing decision-making in the ACKD units taking into account patient preferences.",2024,Feb,Ther Apher Dial,28,1,3-8,,10.1111/1744-9987.14068,37731171,#434,GarcíaAgudo 2024,,,0
Surgical Approach to Bilateral Inguinal Hernia. A Case-Control Study.,Ungureanu CO; Ginghina O; Stanculea F; Vacaroiu I; Ene C; Iosifescu R; Georgescu DE; Cristian DA; Grigorean VT; Iordache N,"Introduction: Bilateral inguinal hernia can be safely repaired simultaneously, open or minimally invasive, in an elective sce-nario. The choice of surgical approach depends on the patient's status, hernia characteristics, surgeons and patient preferences. Whether age criteria should be considered when selecting between the two approaches is still a matter of debate. Considering that there is no consensus regarding the best repair in bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy, the aim of the study is to perform an analysis regarding elective surgical approach of patients with bilateral inguinal hernias. Material and Methods: To study the relationship between exposure to an open versus laparoscopic approach in patients with bilateral inguinal hernia, we conducted a case-control study. In our retrospective analysis, cases (23 patients) were the open-approach hernia repair, and controls (82 patients) were laparoscopic hernia repair. We analyzed two sets of variables: first, related to patient characteristics (age 65 years, BMI 30 kg/m2, smoking habit, HTA status, COPD status, DM status, use of anticoagulants, presence of neoplastic status) and second, variables related to hernia features (inguinoscrotal hernia, recurrent hernia and complicated hernia). Results: The mean age for cases was 73.26 (Ã+-12.99) years and that of controls, was 56.48 (Ã+-15.15) years. Univariate analysis demonstrated four variables with statistical significance: age 65 years, inguinoscrotal hernia, neo-plastic status, and anticoagulant use. When introduced into the multivariate analysis, we noted that only two variables, age 65 years (OR=4.183, 95% CI [1.289, 13.572], p=0.017) and use of anticoagulants (OR=38.876, 95% CI [1.305, 1158.011], p=0.035) reached statistical significance. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that when we refer to bilateral inguinal hernia repair, patients aged 65 years are at risk of having an open procedure at least fourfold more than patients aged 65 years. In addition, the use of anticoagulants increases the risk of open hernia repair 38 times more than that of minimally invasive repair for the same age group. Interestingly, in our study, hernia characteristics were not found to be associated with open hernia repair and age 65 years. In our study we found that age 65 years is associated with electing open hernia repair over minimally invasive repair, which can be linked to age-related risk factors. Further re-search is needed to investigate the impact of age and age-related risk factors on surgical outcomes of bilateral inguinal hernia repair.",2023,Dec,Chirurgia (Bucur),118,6,642-653,,10.21614/chirurgia.2023.v.118.i.6.p.642,38228596,#589,Ungureanu 2023,,,0
Treatment decision-making among patients with metastatic prostate cancer: Impact of decision locus of control on functional outcomes and decision satisfaction.,Schumacher FA; Helenowski IB; Sun Z; Oswald LB; Gonzalez BD; Moses KA; Benning JT; Morgans AK,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making (SDM) for metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) engages patients in the decision-making process and may be associated with better outcomes relative to physician- or patient-directed decision-making. We assessed the association between decision locus of control (DLOC) and patient-reported quality of life (QOL), functional outcomes, and decision satisfaction among mPC patients. METHODS: After a clinic visit in which a treatment decision was made (baseline), mPC patients completed DLOC and QOL surveys. QOL was re-assessed at 2- and 4-months post-baseline. Mean scores for each QOL dimension (physical, emotional, cognitive, social, and role functioning) were compared by DLOC group using mixed effects models. Patient preferences for DLOC and provider communication techniques were similarly collected via survey. RESULTS: Median age of participants (N = 101) was 69 years (range: 49-92); most were White (80%) and married (82%). 62% reported using SDM. At baseline, there were no differences in QOL dimensions between DLOC groups. At 4 months, patient-directed (p = 0.01) and SDM (p = 0.03) were associated with better physical functioning than physician-directed decision-making, and there was an indication of potentially greater decision satisfaction among patients who reported patient-directed (p = 0.06) or SDM (p = 0.10). SDM was the most reported preferred DLOC. CONCLUSION: mPC patients reporting SDM had better physical functioning at 4 months than physician- or patient-directed decision-making, suggesting measurable benefit from patient involvement in decision-making. Future investigations of these associations in larger, more diverse populations can further clarify these previously unmeasured benefits of patient engagement in treatment decisions.",2023,Mar,Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis,26,1,201-206,,10.1038/s41391-023-00647-5,36709235,#1452,Schumacher 2023,,,0
[Technical points of human use experience of ethnic medicine].,Yang ZQ; Tang YQ; Ling Y; DU YP; Yuan WA; Zou C; Tang JY; Hu SY; Gao R; Zhang L,"Ethnic medicine has a rich history of application. Because of the large number of ethnic groups, wide geographical distribution, and unique medical systems in China, the research on the human use experience(HUE) of ethnic medicine should combine the characteristics of ethnic medicine, be based on practical experience, and respect folk practice and tradition. The clinical positioning of ethnic medicine should consider three factors, i.e., population region, dominant diseases, and clinical demand. We should consider the development of traditional preparations that meet the needs of ethnic regions and encourage the development of new drugs that can be popularized and used nationwide for the dominant diseases of ethnic medicines. Attention should be paid to the problems such as a large number of customary articles or substitutes of ethnic medicinal materials, the phenomena of foreign bodies with the same name and different names for the same substance, the different standards of medicinal materials, and the poor processing standards. The name, processing method, source, medicinal parts, and dosage of ethnic medicinal materials or decoction pieces should be determined, and resources should be carefully evaluated to ensure the safety of medicinal resources and ecology. The preparation of ethnic medicine is mostly in the form of pills, powder, ointment, etc., with simple processing technology. The problems of low-quality stan-dards of some preparations, different prescriptions with the same name, and inconsistent processing technology should be overcome, and the process route and main process parameters should be clarified to lay the foundation for the subsequent empirical research on HUE. In the collection and analysis of the HUE data of ethnic medicine, the core guiding ideology of &quot;patient-centered&quot; should be established, and the experience data of patients should be collected. The problems of weak links existing in the inheritance of ethnic medicine should be solved, and flexible and diverse methods should be adopted. Meanwhile, on the premise of complying with the requirements of the principles of medical ethics, we should respect the religion, culture, and customs of ethnic areas to obtain the key HUE information of ethnic medicine. On the basis of the patient preference information and differences in regional disease epidemiology, population characteristics, and medical practice, whether the HUE conclusions of ethnic medicine can be extrapolated to patients outside the region is evaluated from the aspects of clinical benefits, risk tolerance, risk acceptance, etc. The HUE research on ethnic medicine is carried out in a clear way to guide the research and development of new ethnic medicines.",2023,Mar,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,48,5,1402-1406,,10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20221126.501,37005823,#1427,Yang 2023,,,0
"Wire-Free, Nonradioactive Localization Techniques to Guide Surgical Excision of Nonpalpable Breast Tumours: A Health Technology Assessment.",,"BACKGROUND: The current standard treatment for nonpalpable breast tumours is surgical excision; however, it is nearly impossible to locate these small masses during surgery. Therefore, a marker must be implanted into the abnormal tissue under mammography or ultrasound guidance prior to surgery to guide the surgeon to the location of the tumour. Two techniques to localize nonpalpable breast tumours are currently used in Ontario: wire-guided localization and radioactive seed localization.However, these techniques have some limitations. New wire-free, nonradioactive technologies that address these limitations are now available. We conducted a health technology assessment of wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques available in Canada that are used to localize nonpalpable breast tumours for surgical excision. This report includes an evaluation of the effectiveness, safety, and budget impact of publicly funding these techniques, as well as an evaluation of patient preferences and values. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the ROBINS-I tool and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature search, and we analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques to guide surgical excision of nonpalpable breast tumours in Ontario. We did not conduct a primary economic evaluation because of the limited data available to use as model inputs. To contextualize the potential value of wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques, we spoke with people who had undergone a localization procedure for the surgical excision of a nonpalpable breast tumour. RESULTS: We included 16 studies in the clinical evidence review, of which 15 were comparative studies and one was a single-arm study. The results of our analysis of the comparative studies suggest that the re-excision rate for the wire-guided, nonradioactive devices included in this review is either lower or not different from the rate for conventional localization methods (GRADE: Moderate/Low). We found no difference in postoperative complications or operation time between the new and the conventional techniques (GRADE: Moderate). In a feasibility study of a newly developed magnetic seed device in Ontario, no patient required re-excision (GRADE: not assessed). Our economic evidence review identified two costing studies that found that wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques were more expensive than wire-guided and radioactive seed localization. We were unable to identify any published cost-effectiveness evidence for wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques. The annual budget impact of publicly funding wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques in Ontario over the next 5 years ranges from an additional $0.51 million in year 1 to an additional $2.61 million in year 5, for a total 5-year budget impact of $7.73 million. The people we spoke with who had undergone a localization procedure reported valuing surgical interventions that are clinically effective, timely, and patient centred. They responded positively to the potential public funding of wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques and felt that equitable access should be a requirement of implementation. CONCLUSIONS: The wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques included in this review are effective and safe methods for the localization of nonpalpable breast tumours and are reasonable alternatives to wire-guided and radioactive seed localization. We estimate that publicly funding wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques in Ontario would result in an additional cost of $7.73 million over the next 5 years. Broad access to wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques may have a positive impact on patients undergoing surgical excision for a nonpalpable breast tumour. People with lived experience of a localization procedure value surgical interventions that are clinically effective, timely, and patient centred. They also value equitable access to surgical care.",2023,,Ont Health Technol Assess Ser,23,2,1-139,,,37284228,#1232,,,,0
Patient Portal Privacy: Perspectives of Adolescents and Emerging Adults Living with HIV and the Parental/Guardian Role in Supporting Their Care.,Jackman KP; Ohene-Kyei ET; Barfield A; Atanda F; Smith R; Huettner S; Agwu A; Trent M,"BACKGROUND: Increasing the percentage of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), including youth, who are virally suppressed to 95% is an overall goal of the ending the HIV epidemic initiative. While patient portals have become ubiquitous, questions remain about how best to operationalize parental/guardian access to youth's patient portals in alignment with optimizing HIV care outcomes and patient preferences. This qualitative study focuses on understanding perspectives among youth with HIV (YHIV) about parental access to patient portals. METHODS: Eligible participants were YHIV aged 13 to 25 years receiving care at an urban academic hospital. Semistructured individual/paired interviews were conducted between May 2022 and March 2023. Participants were asked to discuss thoughts on parental access to patient portals, and roles parents/guardians have in supporting their HIV care. Semistructured interviews were conducted with adolescent and emerging adult health care workers (HCWs) to gain perspectives on YHIV emergent themes. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim, and we conducted thematic analysis using an inductive approach to identify codes and themes. RESULTS: Sixteen YHIV and four HCWs participated in interviews. Parental roles in coordinating HIV care ranged from supporting YHIV needs for transportation, acquiring, and taking medications, to not having any role at all. Participants shared heterogeneous perspectives about their openness to share patient portal access with their parents/guardians. Perspectives were not strictly congruent along lines of participant age or parental roles in helping youth to manage HIV care. Sharing passwords emerged both as a pathway that YHIV grant access to their accounts and a source of confusion for clinicians when parents/guardians send messages using their child's account. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest HCWs should initiate conversations with YHIV patients to determine preferences for parental/guardian access to their patient portal, educate on proxy access, and explain the extent of medical information that is shared with proxy accounts, regardless of age and perceived parental involvement in HIV care.",2023,Aug,Appl Clin Inform,14,4,752-762,,10.1055/s-0043-1772685,37729944,#995,Jackman 2023,,,0
Determining patient preferences in the treatment of medication-refractory overactive bladder.,Speed J; Welk B; Comiter C; Elliott C,"INTRODUCTION: Overactive bladder (OAB) is often suboptimally addressed by behavioral or pharmacological treatments. Less than 15% of patients choose to pursue advanced OAB therapy (sacral nerve stimulation [SNS], percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation [PTNS], and bladder onabotulinum toxin type-A [BTX-A]). We seek to better understand which factors are most important to patients when choosing a third-line therapy. METHODS/MATERIALS: We developed a conjoint analysis survey that included five attributes of the third-line options for OAB (SNS, PTNS, and BTX-A). We administered the survey to new patients with urinary incontinence at two institutions. A hierarchical Bayes random effects regression analysis was used to determine the relative importance of the attributes. A choice simulator was used to model which third-line treatment options patients preferred. We followed patients to see if they pursued their predicted treatment. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients completed the study of whom 89% were women. There was representation from all age groups. The most important attributes of decision-making were the frequency of future procedures, the risk of catheterization, and the need for a device. On market simulation, SNS was the preferred treatment option (47%), followed by PTNS (29%) and BTX-A (14%). Only 10% of patients did not find any treatment option acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent follow-up, risk of catheterization, and the need for a device were the most important attributes when making a decision on third-line OAB therapy. On market simulation, SNS is the preferred treatment for all age groups though the ultimate choice in third-line therapy may be affected by external factors.",2023,Feb,Neurourol Urodyn,42,2,419-426,,10.1002/nau.25109,36480150,#1550,Speed 2023,,,1
Preferences for COVID-19 Vaccination in People With Chronic Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases.,Hazlewood GS; Colmegna I; Hitchon C; Fortin PR; Bernatsky S; Clarke AE; Mosher D; Wilson T; Thomas M; Barber CEH; Harrison M; Bansback N; Proulx L; Richards DP; Kaplan GG,"OBJECTIVE: To understand how people with chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) trade off the benefits and risks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine options. METHODS: We conducted an online discrete-choice experiment in people with IMIDs to quantify the relative importance (RI) of attributes relevant to COVID-19 vaccination. Participants were recruited between May and August 2021 through patient groups and clinics in Canada, and completed 10 choices where they selected 1 of 2 hypothetical vaccine options or no vaccine. The RI of each attribute was estimated and heterogeneity was explored through latent class analysis. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 551 people (89% female, mean age 46 yrs) with a range of IMIDs (inflammatory bowel disease [48%], rheumatoid arthritis [38%], systemic lupus erythematosus [16%]). Most had received 1 (94%) or 2 (64%) COVID-19 vaccinations. Across the ranges of levels considered, vaccine effectiveness was most important (RI = 66%), followed by disease flare (21%), rare but serious risks (9%), and number/timing of injections (4%). Patients would accept a risk of disease flare requiring a treatment change of ≤ 8.8% for a vaccine with a small absolute increase in effectiveness (10%). Of the 3 latent classes, the group with the greatest aversion to disease flare were more likely to be male and have lower incomes, but this group still valued effectiveness higher than other attributes. CONCLUSION: Patients perceived the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination to outweigh rare serious risks and disease flare.

Impact of Locus of Control on Patient-Provider Communication: A Systematic Review.,Rodriguez A; Delbourgo Patton C; Stephenson-Hunter C,"Growing evidence shows there is heterogeneity in patient communication preferences and a need to tailor communication approaches accordingly. However, little is known about the psychosocial factors that influence communication preferences. Among them is locus of control (LOC), a belief about who or what determines outcomes, including health. Although LOC theory was developed over 60 years ago as a personality theory, its relevance in healthcare has increased over the past two decades. There is a paucity of empirical evidence on patient or provider LOC as it influences communication quality and outcomes in healthcare settings. We conducted a systematic review to collate the current state of the literature.We carried out a comprehensive search of PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Library databases to retrieve relevant peer-reviewed articles. A total of 1152 publications were identified. Our final review included 17 articles that underwent data extraction and quality assessment.The included studies found evidence of LOC associations with several patient and provider communication-related outcomes including satisfaction with care; medical decision-making and communication preferences; adherence; and patient-provider rapport. As opposed to generalized approaches to communication, assessing patient LOC may allow clinicians to tailor their approaches to match patients' LOC. Our findings provide a starting point and highlight the need for future studies.",2023,Mar,J Health Commun,28,3,190-204,,10.1080/10810730.2023.2192014,36974503,#1420,Rodriguez 2023,,,0
Quantifying preferences for urea cycle disorder treatments using a discrete choice experiment.,Edelblut J; Skaar JR; Hilton J; Seibt M; Martin K; Hadker N; Quartel A; Steiner RD,"AIMS: Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) can cause ammonia accumulation and central nervous system toxicity. Nitrogen-binding medications can be efficacious, but certain attributes may negatively impact adherence. This study sought to quantify the administration-related attributes influencing overall prescription selection and patient adherence. METHODS: A web-based, quantitative survey including discrete choice experiment (DCE) methodology captured responses from health care providers for patients with UCDs. A series of hypothetical treatment profile sets with attributes such as route of administration, taste/odor, preparation instructions, packaging, dose measurement, and weight use restrictions were presented. From 16 sets of 3 hypothetical product profiles, respondents evaluated attributes most preferred for prescription selection or patient adherence. Attributes assumed a higher overall preference if relative importance (RI) scores were >16.67% (the value if all attributes were of equal importance). Preference weight scores were assessed. A nine-point Likert scale assessed respondent attitudes, such as satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 51 respondents completed the survey. Respondents reported dissatisfaction with current treatments (mean [SD] = 5.4 [1.7]). For prescription selection, four attributes achieved RI >16.67%: taste/odor (24%), weight restrictions (21%), preparation instructions (18%), and route of administration (17%). For adherence, three attributes related to administration achieved RI >16.67%: taste/odor (28%), preparation instructions (21%), and route of administration (17%). Preference weights for ""taste/odor masked"" were higher than ""not taste/odor masked"" for prescription selection (mean [SD]; 1.52 [1.10] vs -1.52 [1.10]) and treatment adherence (73.8 [55.2] vs -73.8 [55.2]). LIMITATIONS: This study contained a relatively small sample size. Survey respondent selection, the use of hypothetical product profiles, and exclusion of non-pharmacologic treatment options could have contributed to potential biases. CONCLUSIONS: Among attributes tested, taste/odor was the most important attribute influencing overall preference for both prescribing and patient adherence, with taste/odor masking preferred.

Food Allergy Management Practices Utilizing Individual Patient Thresholds: A Work Group Report of the AAAAI Adverse Reactions to Foods Committee.,Oriel RC; Shah A; Anagnostou A; Greenhawt M; Khan F; Leeds S; Ravindran M; Stoffels G; Vickery BP; Virkud YV; Sicherer SH,"The paradigm for food allergy management has been strict avoidance of the food allergen. There is literature supporting a ""high-threshold"" phenotype, those who tolerate a small-to-modest amount of allergen but react to larger amounts. There is no consensus for best practice for these ""high-threshold"" individuals. We sought to understand management practices of ""high-threshold"" reactors using a survey that was distributed to a random sample of fellows and members of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. There were 89 respondents from the United States and Canada (11% response rate), with 64 (72%) answering all questions. Participants worked in private (52%) and academic practice (38%) and saw a median of 30 food allergic patients monthly. Eighty-one percent of respondents reported management strategies other than strict avoidance. When threshold was known, strategies ranged from allowing ingestion up to a specified amount (57%), proactively advising ingestion to a certain amount (56%), or oral immunotherapy (47%). Participants were more likely to choose a permissive approach for a mild reaction in a high-threshold milk-allergic patient compared with a peanut-allergic patient (83% vs 71%, p=.01). Important factors that influenced the approach included severity of reaction (52%), comfort with family/patient using emergency medications (42%), and family/patient preferences (41%).

Clinician communication strategies to navigate differences of opinion with patients.,Sarwar F; Ring D; Donovan E,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated communication strategies clinicians reported using to navigate differences of opinion with patients regarding medical decisions. METHODS: Twenty physicians of various specialties participated in semi-structured interviews regarding their strategies for maintaining mutual respect when disagreeing with a patient. Reflexive thematic analysis was applied. Enrollment concluded upon theme saturation. RESULTS: In an attempt to limit disagreements, physicians learned to gauge patient values, often deferring to clinicians being the expert on medicine and patients being the expert on themselves. Physicians noticed that disagreements were reinforced by prioritizing educational approaches. Strengthening the relationship by validating patient emotions was seen as a more effective strategy. Clinicians found it difficult to weigh relative potential for benefit to the relationship and feelings of moral distress in capitulating to patient preferences they disagreed with. CONCLUSION: Physicians recognized the value of moving from educational to relationship building strategies to help limit and navigate disagreements. Key strategies include prioritizing gauging the patient's values and validating their emotions. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Anticipating disagreement, training clinicians to limit teaching, and instead prioritize a strong relationship to maintain trust and collaboration has the potential to improve patient health, with more limited resource use, and better experiences of care.",2024,Jun,Patient Educ Couns,123,,108185,,10.1016/j.pec.2024.108185,38340633,#164,Sarwar 2024,,,0
International Delphi Study on Wound Closure and Incision Management in Joint Arthroplasty Part 2: Total Hip Arthroplasty.,Ainslie-Garcia M; Anderson LA; Bloch BV; Board TN; Chen AF; Craigie S; Danker W; Gunja N; Harty J; Hernandez VH; Lebedeva K; Hameed D; Mont MA; Nunley RM; Parvizi J; Perka C; Piuzzi NS; Rolfson O; Rychlik J; Romanini E; Sanz-Ruiz P; Sierra RJ; Suleiman L; Tsiridis E; Vendittoli PA; Wangen H; Zagra L,"BACKGROUND: This modified Delphi study aimed to develop a consensus on optimal wound closure and incision management strategies for total hip arthroplasty (THA). Given the critical nature of wound care and incision management in influencing patient outcomes, this study sought to synthesize evidence-based best practices for wound care in THA procedures. METHODS: An international panel of 20 orthopedic surgeons from Europe, Canada, and the United States evaluated a targeted literature review of 18 statements (14 specific to THA and 4 related to both THA and total knee arthroplasty). There were 3 rounds of anonymous voting per topic using a modified 5-point Likert scale with a predetermined consensus threshold of ≥ 75% agreement necessary for a statement to be accepted. RESULTS: After 3 rounds of voting, consensus was achieved for all 18 statements. Notable recommendations for THA wound management included (1) the use of barbed sutures over non-barbed sutures (shorter closing times and overall cost savings); (2) the use of subcuticular sutures over skin staples (lower risk of superficial infections and higher patient preferences, but longer closing times); (3) the use of mesh-adhesives over silver-impregnated dressings (lower rate of wound complications); (4) for at-risk patients, the use of negative pressure wound therapy over other dressings (lower wound complications and reoperations, as well as fewer dressing changes); and (5) the use of triclosan-coated sutures (lower risk of surgical site infection) over standard sutures. CONCLUSIONS: Through a structured modified Delphi approach, a panel of 20 orthopedic surgeons reached consensus on all 18 statements pertaining to wound closure and incision management in THA. This study provides a foundational framework for establishing evidence-based best practices, aiming to reduce variability in patient outcomes and to enhance the overall quality of care in THA procedures.",2024,Feb,J Arthroplasty,,,,,10.1016/j.arth.2024.01.047,38325531,#393,Ainslie-Garcia 2024,,,0

Despite decades of experience with cadaveric greater saphenous vein (GSV), there is limited available data regarding the outcomes and patency of other CP products, specifically arterial and deep venous grafts. This study was designed to evaluate outcomes of non-GSV CP conduits in patients undergoing urgent, emergent, and elective arterial reconstruction at our institution. We hypothesized that non-GSV CP allografts have adequate patency and outcomes and are therefore a feasible alternative to GSV in settings where autologous graft is unavailable or prosthetic grafts are contraindicated. METHODS: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at our institution. We retrospectively reviewed charts of patients undergoing arterial reconstructions using CP conduits from 2010 to 2022. Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, smoking status, indications for surgery, indication for CP conduit use, anatomic reconstruction, urgency of procedure, and blood loss. Time-to-event outcomes included primary and secondary graft patency rates, follow-up amputations, and mortality; other complications included follow-up infection/reinfection and 30-day complications, including return to the operating room and perioperative mortality. Time-to-event analyses were evaluated using product-limit survival estimates. RESULTS: Of 96 identified patients receiving CP conduits, 56 patients received non-GSV conduits for 66 arterial reconstructions. The most common type of non-GSV CP product used was femoral artery (31 patients), followed by aorto-iliac artery (22 patients), and femoral vein (19 patients), with some patients receiving more than one reconstruction or CP product. Patients were mostly male (75%), with a mean age of 63.1 years and a mean body mass index of 26.7 kg/m(2). Indications for CP conduit use included infection in 53 patients, hostile environment in 36 patients, contaminated field in 30 patients, tissue coverage concerns in 30 patients, inadequate conduit in nine patients, and patient preference in one patient. Notably, multiple patients had more than one indication. Most surgeries (95%) were performed in urgent or emergent settings. Supra-inguinal reconstructions were most common (53%), followed by extra-anatomic bypasses (47%). Thirty-day mortality occurred in 10 patients (19%). Fifteen patients (27%) required return to the operating room for indications related to the vascular reconstructions, with 10 (18%) cases being unplanned and five (9%) cases planned/staged. Overall survival at 6, 12, and 24 months was 80%, 68%, and 59%, respectively. Primary patency at 6, 12, and 24 months was 86%, 70%, and 62%, respectively. Amputation freedom at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months was 98%, 95%, and 86%, respectively for non-traumatic indications. CONCLUSIONS: Non-GSV CP products may be used in complex arterial reconstructions when autogenous or prosthetic options are not feasible or available.",2024,Jan,J Vasc Surg,,,,,10.1016/j.jvs.2024.01.201,38286153,#451,Sanin 2024,,,0
Do the Few Dictate Care for the Many? Revascularisation Considerations That Go Beyond the Guidelines.,Vervoort D; Sud M; Zeis TM; Haouzi AA; An KR; Rocha R; Eikelboom R; Fremes SE; Tamis-Holland JE,"The burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) is large and growing, commonly presenting with comorbidities and older age. Patients may benefit from coronary revascularisation with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), yet half of patients with CAD who would benefit from revascularisation fall outside the eligibility criteria of trials to date. As such, the choice of revascularisation procedures varies depending on the CAD anatomy and complexity, surgical risk and comorbidities, the patient's preferences and values, and the treating team's expertise. The recent American guidelines on coronary revascularisation are comprehensive in describing recommendations for PCI, CABG, or conservative management in patients with CAD. However, individual challenging patient presentations cannot be fully captured in guidelines. The aim of this narrative review is to summarise common clinical scenarios that are not sufficiently described by contemporary clinical guidelines and trials in order to inform heart team members and trainees about the nuanced considerations and available evidence to manage such cases. We discuss clinical cases that fall beyond the current guidelines and summarise the relevant evidence evaluating coronary revascularisation for these patients. In addition, we highlight gaps in knowledge based on a lack of research (eg, ineligibility of certain patient populations), underrepresentation in research (eg, underenrollment of female and non-White patients), and the surge in newer minimally invasive and hybrid techniques. We argue that ultimately, evidence-based medicine, patient preference, shared decision making, and effective heart team communications are necessary to best manage complex CAD presentations potentially benefitting from revascularisation with CABG or PCI.",2024,Feb,Can J Cardiol,40,2,275-289,,10.1016/j.cjca.2023.11.007,38181974,#414,Vervoort 2024,,,0
Sequential management of postmenopausal health and osteoporosis: An update.,Calaf-Alsina J; Cano A; Guañabens N; Palacios S; Cancelo MJ; Castelo-Branco C; Larrainzar-Garijo R; Neyro JL; Nogues X; Diez-Perez A,"Increased life expectancy means that women are now in a hypoestrogenic state for approximately one-third of their lives. Overall health and specifically bone health during this period evolves in accordance with aging and successive exposure to various risk factors. In this review, we provide a summary of the approaches to the sequential management of osteoporosis within an integrative model of care to offer physicians a useful tool to facilitate therapeutic decision-making. Current evidence suggests that pharmacologic agents should be selected based on the risk of fractures, which does not always correlate with age. Due to their effect on bone turnover and on other hormone-regulated phenomena, such as hot flushes or breast cancer risk, we position hormone therapy and selective estrogen receptor modulators as an early postmenopause intervention for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. When the use of these agents is not possible, compelling evidence supports antiresorptive agents as first-line treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in many clinical scenarios, with digestive conditions, kidney function, readiness for compliance, or patient preferences playing a role in choosing between bisphosphonates or denosumab during this period. For patients at high risk of osteoporotic fracture, the ""anabolic first"" approach reduces that risk. The effect on bone health with these bone-forming agents or with denosumab should be consolidated with the subsequent use of antiresorptive agents. Regardless of the strategy, follow-up and treatment should be maintained indefinitely to help prevent fractures.",2023,Nov,Maturitas,177,,107846,,10.1016/j.maturitas.2023.107846,37738717,#720,Calaf-Alsina 2023,,,0
Determining Goal Concordant Care in the Intensive Care Unit Using Electronic Health Records.,Ahmad SR; Tarabochia AD; Budahn L; LeMahieu AM; Karnatovskaia LV; Turnbull AE; Gajic O,"BACKGROUND: Goal concordant care (GCC) is the alignment of care to patient values and preferences. GCC is a major outcome of communication with patients and families in serious/critical illness. Using the electronic health record (EHR) to study the provision of GCC would be pragmatic and cost-effective for research and quality improvement efforts. RESEARCH QUESTION: Do EHRs contain information to identify GCC? METHODS: This is a feasibility retrospective chart review performed by two independent reviewers. An existing framework containing four questions for identifying GCC was adopted. Two clinicians reviewed multi-disciplinary notes and extracted pertinent information. The primary outcomes were whether the four key questions for determining goal concordance could be answered using information in the EHR. The secondary outcome was the type of goals identified. Cohen's kappa was used to measure agreement between two reviewers. RESULTS: Patient care was considered goal concordant in 35 (85%) of 41 patients in a random sample comprising of 36 survivors and five who died in hospital. Inter-rater agreement on identifying data to determine GCC was excellent (Kappa 0.70). Patient goals were identified in 80% of charts reviewed. Note sources informative of patient preferences, included social work (39%), hospital progress notes (29%), palliative care (20%), and physical/occupational therapy (15%). ""Returning home"" and ""getting better/ stronger"" were among the most common patient goals captured in EHR. CONCLUSION: The EHR can be used to understand patient goals, but the information is scattered across the multi-disciplinary notes. Improving EHR and external validation will facilitate ascertainment of goal concordance as an important outcome measure.",2023,Mar,J Pain Symptom Manage,65,3,e199-e205,,10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2022.11.002,36400406,#1478,Ahmad 2023,,,0
Peer Support in Rheumatic Diseases: A Narrative Literature Review.,Karp N; Yazdany J; Schmajuk G,"Rheumatic diseases are a group of chronic conditions that are associated with significant morbidity, impaired physical function, psychosocial stress, and cost to the healthcare system. Peer support interventions have been shown to have a positive impact on health outcomes in several chronic conditions, but no review has specifically assessed the impact of peer support on rheumatic conditions. The aim of this narrative literature review was to understand how peer support has been applied in the field of rheumatology, with a specific focus on the impact of observational and randomized studies of direct peer support interventions on various outcome measures across rheumatic conditions. We also examined studies exploring patient attitudes and preferences toward peer support. The majority of studies included focused on peer support in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Generally, patients across the spectrum of rheumatic disease perceive peer support as a useful tool. Peer support interventions, while highly variable, were generally associated with positive impacts on health-related quality of life metrics (both perceived and measured), although these differences were not always statistically significant. Important limitations include variability in study design, selection bias among study participants, and short follow-up periods across most peer support interventions.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,2433-2449,,10.2147/PPA.S391396,37808273,#800,Karp 2023,,,0

Patients' willingness to accept adverse event and cost tradeoffs from oral nicotinamide for reduced risk of non-melanoma skin cancer.,Boeri M; Skelsey MK; Schiro JA; Dozier SE; Glinert R; Okun MM,"BACKGROUND: Non-immunosuppressed patients with a history of multiple non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) taking oral nicotinamide supplementation experienced a 23% decrease in annual NMSC risk in a randomized clinical trial. Patient preferences for risks and costs associated with nicotinamide are unknown. OBJECTIVES: To understand how patients prioritize NMSC reduction, infection risk, and cost. METHODS: A sample of adults with history of ≥2 NMSC within the past five years undergoing Mohs procedure completed a discrete-choice experiment comprising two hypothetical treatments-characterized by varying reductions in NMSC incidence, increased severe infection risk, and cost-and no treatment. The data were analyzed with random-parameters logit models. RESULTS: A total of 203 subjects (mean age 71.5 years, 65.5% males) participated. For a 23% annual reduction in NMSC incidence, a 26% [95% CI: 8%-45%] annual increase in severe infection risk and $8 [95% CI: $2-14] monthly cost was acceptable. Outcomes across analyzed subgroups (before vs. during COVID pandemic, site of interview, less vs. more prior NMSCs) were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Patients were unwilling to accept high severe infection risks to obtain the reduction in NMSC incidence observed in a nicotinamide trial, suggesting that routinely recommending nicotinamide may run counter to some patients' preferences.",2023,Dec,J Dermatolog Treat,34,1,2247105,,10.1080/09546634.2023.2247105,37587862,#631,Boeri 2023,,,1
"A discrete choice experiment to elicit preferences for a chronic disease screening programme in Queensland, Australia.",Senanayake S; Barnett A; Brain D; Allen M; Powell EE; O'Beirne J; Valery P; Hickman IJ; Kularatna S,"OBJECTIVE: Patient-centred care, increasingly highlighted in healthcare strategies, necessitates understanding public preferences for healthcare service attributes. We aimed to understand the preferences of the Australian population regarding the attributes of chronic disease screening programmes. STUDY DESIGN: The preferences were elicited using the discrete choice experiment (DCE) methodology. METHODS: A DCE was administered to a sample of the Australian general population. Respondents were asked to make choices, each offering two hypothetical screening scenarios defined by screening conduct, quality and accuracy of the test results, cost to the patient, wait time and source of information. Data were analysed using a panel mixed multinomial logit model. RESULTS: A strong preference for highly accurate screening tests and nurse-led screenings at local health clinics was evident. They expressed disutility for waiting time and out-of-pocket costs but were indifferent about the source of information. Their preference for a nurse-led programme was highlighted by the fact that they were willing to pay $81 and $88 to get a nurse-led programme when they were offered a general practitioner-led and a specialist-led programme, respectively. Furthermore, they were willing to pay $32 to reduce a week of waiting time and $205 for a 95% accurate test compared to a 75% accurate test. Preferences remained consistent irrespective of the respondent's place of residence. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of diagnostic test accuracy and nurse-led service delivery in chronic disease screening programmes. These insights could guide the development of patient-centric services by enhancing test accuracy, reducing waiting times and promoting nurse-led care models.",2024,Mar,Public Health,228,,105-111,,10.1016/j.puhe.2024.01.007,38354579,#287,Senanayake 2024,,,1
Factors that influence preference for male or female urologist among underserved patients in New York City.,Razdan S; Ho P; Bieber C; Sljivich M; Anastos H; Busby D; Simma-Chiang V,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of patient preference for male or female urologic provider and explore which patient characteristics influence this preference. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After obtaining hospital Institutional Review Board approval, a 14-question survey in English and Spanish was administered across four general urology clinic sites in a single hospital system in New York City. The survey asked demographic questions and preference for a male or a female urologist. The survey included questions pertaining to the nature of the clinic visit and subsequent provider preference as well. Statistics were performed using Stata 16 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). RESULTS: A total of 540 patients completed the 14-question survey. The vast majority of survey respondents identified as male (90%). The largest proportion demographic groups were those aged 41-60 (47%), Hispanic or Latino (43%), Catholic (47%), unemployed (40%) and those with a high school level of education (34%). Most patients (60%) did not have a preference for a specific gender provider, whereas 37% preferred a male provider, and 3% preferred a female provider. On univariate analysis, patient age 25-40, less than high school education level and lack of employment were significant predictors of provider gender preference (p < 0.05), with most patients indicating a male provider preference. On multivariate analysis of gender, age, education level and employment status, gender and education level were not significant predictors of preference, whereas age 25-40 and being unemployed were significant predictors (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Patient gender, race and religion do not appear to influence their preference to be seen by a male or a female urologist in the clinic setting. However, patient age, unemployment and potentially educational attainment were significantly associated with a provider gender preference.",2023,Mar,BJUI Compass,4,2,167-172,,10.1002/bco2.196,36816153,#1442,Razdan 2023,,,0
Beyond 10-year lead-times in EQ-5D-5L: leveraging alternative lead-times in willingness-to-accept questions to capture preferences for worse-than-dead states and their implication.,Chang JA; Hsu CN; Ramos-Goñi JM; Luo N; Lin HW; Lin FJ,"BACKGROUND: A fixed 10-year lead-time in composite time-trade-off (C-TTO) tasks might compromise the precision of utility values below - 1. This study explored how alternative lead-times (ALTs) influence EQ-5D-5L value sets and their implications in economic evaluations. METHODS: Leveraging data from Taiwan's EQ-5D-5L valuation and capitalizing on its exploratory willingness-to-accept question, we explored participants' quantification of ""worse-than-dead (WTD)"" health states with ALTs up to 50 years. We then derived alternative value sets incorporating these ALTs through interval regression and compared them against those from conventional models. To evaluate their impact on health change valuation, we simulated utility differences for all possible EQ-5D-5L health-state-pairs using each value set. RESULTS: With a salient floor effect observed in the C-TTO values, the model with ALT led to a wider range of predicted utilities ( - 2.3897 ~ 1), compared with those of conventional models (generalized least squares (GLS):  - 0.7773 ~ 1; Tobit-GLS:  - 0.9583 ~ 1). Compared to the Tobit-GLS model, the model with ALT increased the numerical distance in 80% of health-state-pairs, with 11% decreasing and 9% altering direction (e.g., positive to negative) in utility differences. CONCLUSIONS: While ALTs offer insights into patient preferences, their integration into economic evaluations might require rescaling. Future research should prioritize advanced rescaling methods or enhanced elicitation strategies for populations with substantial censoring. This is pivotal for improving the elicitation of extreme WTD states and accurately discerning the relative distances between health states. Countries developing EQ-5D-5L value sets should consider pilot studies and incorporating region-specific questions on social determinants, especially where pronounced floor effects are suspected.",2023,Dec,Eur J Health Econ,,,,,10.1007/s10198-023-01642-2,38072877,#571,Chang 2023,,,0
Management strategies for antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction.,Lach F; Bottemanne H; Hingray C; Papeta D; Rousseau A; Javelot H,"Antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction is one of the most frequently met adverse effects for individuals suffering from major depressive disorder. When primary prevention by non-pharmacological measures fails, empirical coping strategies might be proposed. In this article, we present a brief overview of pharmacological strategies for antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction, considering antidepressants and conceivable corrective medications. We suggest dividing these strategies into three groups: (1) tapering (dose reduction, therapeutic window or short-term treatment interruption); (2) maintenance (focusing on spontaneous remission); (3) optimizing treatment (substitution for another antidepressant or addition of treatments to correct sexual side effects). Whichever strategy is selected, we encourage the clinician to propose the most adequate therapeutic option for the patient, while considering the efficacy and overall tolerance of the current antidepressant strategy, the affected phase of sexuality and patient preferences and gender. This summary is limited to antidepressant treatments and correctors marketed in France and aimed at a clinician reading to help manage patients suffering from antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.",2024,Feb,Encephale,,,,,10.1016/j.encep.2023.11.025,38311476,#395,Lach 2024,,,0
The relevance of fatigue to relapse rate in multiple sclerosis: Applying patient preference data to the OPTIMUM trial.,Fox RJ; Tervonen T; Phillips-Beyer A; Sidorenko T; Boyanova N; Brooks A; Hennessy B; Jamieson C; Levitan B,"BACKGROUND: In the OPTIMUM trial in patients with relapsing MS, treatment differences in annualized relapse rate (ARR, 0.088) and change in fatigue at week 108 (3.57 points, measured using the Fatigue Symptoms and Impacts Questionnaire-Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis, symptom domain (FSIQ-RMS-S)) favored ponesimod over teriflunomide. However, the importance of the fatigue outcome to patients was unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the importance of the OPTIMUM FSIQ-RMS-S results using data from an MS discrete choice experiment (DCE). METHODS: The DCE included components to correlate levels of physical and cognitive fatigue with FSIQ-RMS-S scores. Changes in relapses/year and time to MS progression equivalent to the treatment difference in fatigue in OPTIMUM were determined for similar fatigue levels as mean baseline fatigue in OPTIMUM. RESULTS: DCE participants would accept 0.06 more relapses/year or a 0.15-0.17 year decrease in time to MS progression for a 3.57-point difference in physical fatigue on the FSIQ-RMS-S. To improve cognitive fatigue by 3.57-points on the FSIQ-RMS-S, DCE participants would accept 0.09-0.10 more relapses/year or a 0.24-0.28 year decrease in time to MS progression.

"A review of evidence, antimicrobial stability, and feasibility considerations for OPAT continuous infusion.",Van Abel AL; Childs-Kean LM; Jensen KL; Mynatt RP; Ryan KL; Rivera CG,"Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) has been widely used in clinical practice for many decades because of its associated cost savings, reductions in inpatient hospital days, and decreases in hospital-associated infections. Despite this long history, evolving practice patterns and new drug delivery devices continue to present challenges as well as opportunities for clinicians when designing appropriate outpatient antimicrobial regimens. One such change is the increasing use of extended and continuous infusion (CI) of antimicrobials to optimize the achievement of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic targets. Elastomeric devices are also becoming increasingly popular in OPAT, including for the delivery of CI.

Patient Preferences for Cardiac Rehabilitation - A Systematic Review.,Liu Y; Su M; Lei Y; Tian J; Xue L; Zhang L,"BACKGROUND: Although a large number of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation(CR), patient preferences for CR remain unclear. Knowing patient preferences may contribute to increasing patient participation and adherence, thus improving patient prognosis. METHODS: A systematic search was carried out using electronic databases and manual reference checks from inception until 15th June 2022. Quantitative studies, qualitative studies and mixed methods studies assessing patient preferences for CR were included. Two researchers independently conducted study selectionand data extraction. CR preferences were divided into three categories: CR settings, CR components, and CR contents. A narrative synthesis was applied to integrate the results of the included studies. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to assess the quality of included studies. RESULTS: Ultimately, 17 publications were included in this study. Regarding CR settings, most patients preferred the hospital to home, some considered both, and a few were willing to accept the local CR club as an alternative setting to the hospital. For CR components, regardless of age and gender, patients considered exercise training and nutrition counseling to be the most important and smoking cessation to be the least important. In exercise intervention of CR contents, progress discussion and encouragement were rated as most critical, and non-conflicting with other activities was rated as least critical. In psychological intervention of CR contents, most patients were willing to accept psychological intervention, and a few patients wanted to heal the trauma with the passage of time. CONCLUSION: This systematic review provides important insights into patient preferences for CR, clarifying patient preferences for CR settings, components, and contents, along with possible influencing factors. Patient preferences may change due to the COVID-19 epidemic, and there is still a need to focus on patient preferences for CR and conduct more relevant primary research to validate the findings of this paper in the future.",2023,,Patient Prefer Adherence,17,,75-88,,10.2147/PPA.S392417,36636288,#1599,Liu 2023,,,1
[Cosmetic outcome of nasal tip reconstruction with the frontonasal flap and other locoregional flaps - Cosmetic Outcome of Nasal Tip Reconstruction].,Andresen JR; Scheufler O,"BACKGROUND: This study investigates the results of nasal tip reconstruction with the frontonasal flap compared with other locoregional flaps. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All nasal tip reconstructions with locoregional flaps performed during a 10-year period were included. Defect size, flap type, risk factors, comorbidities, complications, revisions, and secondary operations were retrospectively assessed. Clinical follow-up examinations were performed after 12 months. Digital photographs were taken in standard projections preoperatively and at the time of the last follow-up examination, and the aesthetic results were assessed by three independent examiners, with nasal contour, symmetry, scarring, and match of skin colour between flap and nasal skin rated on a 4-point scale. Finally, patient satisfaction was obtained. RESULTS: A total of 112 nasal tip reconstructions were performed in 68 women and 44 men with a mean age of 71,4±10,2 years. Taking into account defect size, individual factors and patient preference, reconstruction was performed with 58 frontonasal flaps, 23 Rintala flaps, 20 paramedian forehead flaps and 11 bilobed flaps. Mean age and comorbidities of patients were comparable between flap types, except for a higher incidence of arterial hypertension and a lower incidence of diabetes mellitus in patients treated with frontonasal flaps. Defect size was the same in reconstructions with frontonasal flaps and Rintala flaps, smaller in bilobed flaps, and more extensive in paramedian forehead flaps. There were no differences in complication rates between the different flap techniques. Taking into account the planned second interventions (flap pedicle separations) in the paramedian forehead flaps, the frequency of unplanned corrections was comparable for all flap techniques. Aesthetic results and patient satisfaction were rated as very good or good in more than 90% with all techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the paramedian forehead flap, the frontonasal flap avoids a planned secondary procedure and an extensive donor defect. It allows for the coverage of defects at least the size of the Rintala flap and larger defects than the bilobed flap.",2023,Aug,Handchir Mikrochir Plast Chir,55,4,278-286,,10.1055/a-2069-2246,37224879,#1016,Andresen 2023,,,0
Spanish multidisciplinary consensus on the characteristics of severe asthma patients on biologic treatment who are candidates for at-home administration.,Cisneros-Serrano C; Rial MJ; Gómez-Bastero-Fernández A; Igea JM; Martínez-Meca A; Fernández-Lisón LC; López-Carrasco V; Villamañán-Bueno E; Plá-Martí MJ; Chiner E,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Biologic therapies are known to reduce exacerbations and improve severe uncontrolled asthma management.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This project is based on the Delphi method, designed to reach an expert consensus through a multidisciplinary scientific committee addressing the following questions: clinical characteristics, treatment adherence, patient or caregiver administration ability, patient self-care, relationship with the healthcare professional, patient preference, and access to the hospital. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-one healthcare professionals (pulmonologists, allergists, nurses, and hospital pharmacists) completed two Delphi consensus questionnaires. Fourteen items were identified as priority characteristics, the first five being: 1. The patient follows the healthcare team's indications/recommendations to control their disease, 2. The patient is capable of detecting any deterioration in their disease and of identifying exacerbation triggers, 3. The patient receives biologic therapy and has stable disease with no vital risk, 4. The patient takes responsibility for their self-care, 5. The patient has occupational/educational obligations that prevent them from going to the hospital regularly.

"Evaluation of Orthodontic Treatment Method Preferences of Dentistry Students, Dentists and Orthodontic Residents.",Kadıoğlu MB; Çakmak B; Altunal EK; Rübendiz M,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate orthodontic treatment method preferences among dentistry students, dentists and orthodontic residents taking into account factors such as esthetics, advantage/disadvantage, cost and treatment duration. METHODS: The study was carried out on three groups: dentistry students (n=318), dentists (n=110) and orthodontic residents (n=98), and a 17-question survey was applied. Questionnaire forms included informational photos of conventional metal brackets (CMB), esthetic ceramic brackets (ECB), self-ligating brackets (SLB), clear aligner (CA), and lingual brackets (LB). The participants' preferences for orthodontic treatment methods were evaluated using chi-square analysis, not only between groups but also considering gender and income level. RESULTS: Regarding esthetics, dentists (41%) and orthodontic residents (78%) mostly preferred CA, while dentistry students mostly preferred LB (44%). With regard to advantage/disadvantage, dentistry students (31%) and dentists (39%) mostly preferred SLB, while orthodontic residents mostly preferred CA (55%). Regarding the success of the treatment, all three groups mostly preferred CMB. (respectively 50%; 47%; 72%). While CA was mostly preferred for short-term treatments in all three groups (respectively 40%; 71%; 88%), CMB was mostly preferred for long-term treatments (respectively 35%, 51%, 55%). Gender and income-level differences had little effect on orthodontic treatment method preferences.

"A care substitution service in the Netherlands: impact on referral, cost, and patient satisfaction.",Albada T; Berger MY; Brunninkhuis W; van Kalken D; Vermeulen KM; Damstra RJ; Holtman GA,"BACKGROUND: In care substitution services, medical specialists offer brief consultations to provide general practitioners (GPs) with advice on diagnosis, treatment, or hospital referral. When GPs serve as gatekeepers to secondary care, these regional services could reduce pressures on healthcare systems. The aim is to determine the impact of implementing a care substitution service for dermatology, orthopaedics, and cardiology on the hospital referral rate, health care costs, and patient satisfaction. METHODS: A before-after study was used to evaluate hospital referral rates and health care costs during a follow-up period of 1 year. The study population comprised patients with eligible International Classification of Primary Care codes for referral to the care substitution service (only dermatology, orthopaedic, cardiology indications), as pre-defined by GPs and medical specialists. We compared referral rates before and after implementation by χ(2) tests and evaluated patient preference by qualitative analysis. RESULTS: In total, 4,930 patients were included, 2,408 before and 2,522 after implementation. The care substitution service decreased hospital referrals during the follow-up period from 15 to 11%. The referral rate decreased most for dermatology (from 15 to 9%), resulting in a cost reduction of €10.59 per patient, while the other two specialisms experienced smaller reductions in referral rates. Patients reported being satisfied, mainly because of the null cost, improved organisation, improved care, and positive experience of the consultation. CONCLUSIONS: The care substitution service showed promise for specialisms that require fewer hospital facilities, as exemplified by dermatology.",2023,Sep,BMC Prim Care,24,1,171,,10.1186/s12875-023-02137-y,37658285,#901,Albada 2023,,,0
Center Hemodialysis Versus Peritoneal Dialysis: A Cost-Utility Analysis.,Matrisch L; Rau Y,"Introduction Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) is needed for patients with end-stage kidney disease. While it is clear that kidney transplantation remains the gold standard in KRT, data comparing the cost-utility of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) are scarce. No such analysis has been performed for German patients.  Methods We used aggregated data generated by the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) for quality of life and insurance claims to evaluate mortality and economic impact. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and cost-utility were calculated accordingly.  Results PD is superior to HD within all dimensions of the SF-36, both in terms of QALY and cost-utility. The difference in cost per QALY between the aggregated physical dimensions (€50,671.54 vs. €39,745.77) is greater than that of the aggregated mental dimensions (€31,638.75 vs. €25,287.63). However, there is considerable variability among patients.  Conclusion From a health-economic point of view, PD should be preferred over HD when deciding on the KRT modality for the patient. This is not reflected in current practice, though. However, interindividual differences and patient preferences should be considered in the decision.",2024,Mar,Cureus,16,3,e55667,,10.7759/cureus.55667,38586632,#256,Matrisch 2024,,,0
Quality of Life in Oncology: Measuring What Matters for Cancer Patients and Survivors in Europe: The EUonQol Project.,Apolone G; Brunelli C,"Cancer, in Europe, is the second cause of death. In addition, there is an unacceptable variability in terms of access to innovation, quality of care, and outcomes, within and between countries. The European Union has activated an unprecedented initiative to fight cancer by launching Europe's Beating Cancer Plan and the Cancer Mission. The goals are to reduce mortality, increase survival, and ameliorate quality of life by increasing knowledge, improving quality of care, and reducing inequalities through interventions on actionable determinants of variability. A competitive call was launched with the objective to develop and validate a set of quality of life and patient preference measures for cancer patients and survivors, to be used for routine data collection all over Europe.

"European guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of breast lesions with uncertain malignant potential (B3 lesions) developed jointly by EUSOMA, EUSOBI, ESP (BWG) and ESSO.",Rubio IT; Wyld L; Marotti L; Athanasiou A; Regitnig P; Catanuto G; Schoones JW; Zambon M; Camps J; Santini D; Dietz J; Sardanelli F; Varga Z; Smidt M; Sharma N; Shaaban AM; Gilbert F,"INTRODUCTION: Breast lesions of uncertain malignant potential (B3) include atypical ductal and lobular hyperplasias, lobular carcinoma in situ, flat epithelial atypia, papillary lesions, radial scars and fibroepithelial lesions as well as other rare miscellaneous lesions. They are challenging to categorise histologically, requiring specialist training and multidisciplinary input. They may coexist with in situ or invasive breast cancer (BC) and increase the risk of subsequent BC development. Management should focus on adequate classification and management whilst avoiding overtreatment. The aim of these guidelines is to provide updated information regarding the diagnosis and management of B3 lesions, according to updated literature review evidence. METHODS: These guidelines provide practical recommendations which can be applied in clinical practice which include recommendation grade and level of evidence. All sections were written according to an updated literature review and discussed at a consensus meeting. Critical appraisal by the expert writing committee adhered to the 23 items in the international Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) tool. RESULTS: Recommendations for further management after core-needle biopsy (CNB) or vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) diagnosis of a B3 lesion reported in this guideline, vary depending on the presence of atypia, size of lesion, sampling size, and patient preferences. After CNB or VAB, the option of vacuum-assisted excision or surgical excision should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team and shared decision-making with the patient is crucial for personalizing further treatment. De-escalation of surgical intervention for B3 breast lesions is ongoing, and the inclusion of vacuum-assisted excision (VAE) will decrease the need for surgical intervention in further approaches. Communication with patients may be different according to histological diagnosis, presence or absence of atypia, or risk of upgrade due to discordant imaging. Written information resources to help patients understand these issues alongside with verbal communication is recommended. Lifestyle interventions have a significant impact on BC incidence so lifestyle interventions need to be suggested to women at increased BC risk as a result of a diagnosis of a B3 lesion. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide a state-of-the-art overview of the diagnosis, management and prognosis of B3 lesions in modern multidisciplinary breast practice.",2024,Jan,Eur J Surg Oncol,50,1,107292,,10.1016/j.ejso.2023.107292,38061151,#512,Rubio 2024,,,0
Multimodal prehabilitation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing anatomical resection: protocol of a non-randomised feasibility study.,Molenaar CJL; Von Meyenfeldt EM; de Betue CTI; van den Berg R; Ten Cate DWG; Schep G; Youssef-El Soud M; van Thiel E; Rademakers N; Hoornweg SC; Slooter GD; van den Broek F; Marres GMH,"BACKGROUND: The preoperative period can be used to enhance a patient's functional capacity with multimodal prehabilitation and consequently improve and fasten postoperative recovery. Especially, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) surgical patients may benefit from this intervention, since the affected and resected organ is an essential part of the cardiorespiratory fitness. Drafting a prehabilitation programme is challenging, since many disciplines are involved, and time between diagnosis of NSCLC and surgery is limited. We designed a multimodal prehabilitation programme prior to NSCLC surgery and aimed to conduct a study to assess feasibility and indicative evidence of efficacy of this programme. Publication of this protocol may help other healthcare facilities to implement such a programme. METHODS: The multimodal prehabilitation programme consists of an exercise programme, nutritional support, psychological support, smoking cessation, patient empowerment and respiratory optimisation. In two Dutch teaching hospitals, 40 adult patients with proven or suspected NSCLC will be included. In a non-randomised fashion, 20 patients follow the multimodal prehabilitation programme, and 20 will be assessed in the control group, according to patient preference. Assessments will take place at four time points: baseline, the week before surgery, 6 weeks postoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. Feasibility and indicative evidence of efficacy of the prehabilitation programme will be assessed as primary outcomes. DISCUSSION: Since the time between diagnosis of NSCLC and surgery is limited, it is a challenge to implement a prehabilitation programme. This study will assess whether this is feasible, and evidence of efficacy can be found. The non-randomised fashion of the study might result in a selection and confounding bias. However, the control group may help putting the results of the prehabilitation group in perspective. By publishing this protocol, we aim to facilitate others to evaluate and implement a multimodal prehabilitation programme for surgical NSCLC patients.

Nurses' Perceived Effects of Visitor Restrictions in Hospital Maternity Units.,Iobst SE; Breman RB; Black H; Edmonds JK,"PURPOSE: To explore how perinatal nurses perceive the effects of visitor restrictions on patient care within a hospital setting. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We distributed a cross-sectional survey online to perinatal nurses in May of 2022. Characteristics of respondents were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Responses to an open-ended question were analyzed via conventional content analysis. RESULTS: Among our sample of 101 nurses, we identified seven codes representing positive effects and seven codes representing negative effects. The most frequently reported positive effects were ability to provide person-centered care (n = 36, 35.6%) and less patient stress and more rest (n = 29, 28.7%). The most frequently reported negative effects were limited patient support (n = 22, 21.8%) and emotional distress to the patient (n = 15, 14.9%). Fourteen percent (n = 14) of respondents cited both positive and negative effects. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Nurses perceived that visitor restrictions resulted in both positive and negative patient experiences. Balancing clinical needs and safety considerations with emotional needs of the childbearing individual requires careful consideration by maternity care clinicians and health care systems. Subsequent research is needed to determine optimal visitation policies during intrapartum and postpartum with consideration to hospital context and patient preferences for optimal care.",2024,Mar,MCN Am J Matern Child Nurs,,,,,10.1097/NMC.0000000000001020,38512154,#221,Iobst 2024,,,0
Management of Lobular Neoplasia Diagnosed by Core Biopsy.,Jani C; Lotz M; Keates S; Gupta Y; Walker A; Al Omari O; Parvez A; Patel D; Gnata M; Perry J; Khorashadi L; Weissmann L; Pories SE,"Lobular neoplasia (LN) involves proliferative changes within the breast lobules. LN is divided into lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH). LCIS can be further subdivided into three subtypes: classic LCIS, pleomorphic LCIS, and LCIS with necrosis (florid type). Because classic LCIS is now considered as a benign etiology, current guidelines recommend close follow-up with imaging versus surgical excision. The goal of our study was to determine if the diagnosis of classic LN on core needle biopsy (CNB) merits surgical excision. This is a retrospective, observational study conducted at Mount Auburn Hospital, Cambridge, MA, from May 17, 2017, through June 30, 2020. We reviewed the data of breast biopsies conducted at our hospital over this period and included patients who were diagnosed with classic LN (LCIS and/or ALH) and excluded patients having any other atypical lesions on CNB. All known cancer patients were excluded. Of the 2707 CNBs performed during the study period, we identified 68 women who were diagnosed with ALH or LCIS on CNB. CNB was performed for an abnormal mammogram in the majority of patients (60; 88%) while 7(10.3%) had an abnormal breast magnetic resonance imaging study (MRI), and 1 had an abnormal ultrasound (US). A total of 58 patients (85%) underwent excisional biopsy, of which 3 (5.2%) showed malignancy, including 2 cases of DCIS and 1 invasive carcinoma. In addition, there was 1 case (1.7%) with pleomorphic LCIS and 11 cases with ADH (15.5%). The management of LN found on core biopsy is evolving, with some advocating surgical excision and others recommending observation. Our data show a change in diagnosis with excisional biopsy in 13 (22.4%) of patients with 2 cases of DCIS, 1 invasive carcinoma, 1 pleomorphic LCIS, and 9 cases of ADH, diagnosed on excisional biopsy. While ALH and classic LCIS are considered benign, the choice of ongoing surveillance versus excisional biopsy should be made with shared decision making with the patient, with consideration of personal and family history, as well as patient preferences.",2023,,Breast J,2023,,8185446,,10.1155/2023/8185446,37114120,#1323,Jani 2023,,,0

Incorporating patient preferences and burden-of-disease in evaluating ALS drug candidate AMX0035: a Bayesian decision analysis perspective.,Xu Q; Cho J; Ben Chaouch Z; Lo AW,"OBJECTIVE: Provide US FDA and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) society with a systematic, transparent, and quantitative framework to evaluate the efficacy of the ALS therapeutic candidate AMX0035 in its phase 2 trial, which showed statistically significant effects (p-value 3%) in slowing the rate of ALS progression on a relatively small sample size of 137 patients. METHODS: We apply Bayesian decision analysis (BDA) to determine the optimal type I error rate (p-value) under which the clinical evidence of AMX0035 supports FDA approval. Using rigorous estimates of ALS disease burden, our BDA framework strikes the optimal balance between FDA's need to limit adverse effects (type I error) and patients' need for expedited access to a potentially effective therapy (type II error). We apply BDA to evaluate long-term patient survival based on clinical evidence from AMX0035 and Riluzole. RESULTS: The BDA-optimal type I error for approving AMX0035 is higher than the 3% p-value reported in the phase 2 trial if the probability of the therapy being effective is at least 30%. Assuming a 50% probability of efficacy and a signal-to-noise ratio of treatment effect between 25% and 50% (benchmark: 33%), the optimal type I error rate ranges from 2.6% to 26.3% (benchmark: 15.4%). The BDA-optimal type I error rate is robust to perturbations in most assumptions except for a probability of efficacy below 5%. CONCLUSION: BDA provides a useful framework to incorporate subjective perspectives of ALS patients and objective burden-of-disease metrics to evaluate the therapeutic effects of AMX0035 in its phase 2 trial.",2023,May,Amyotroph Lateral Scler Frontotemporal Degener,24,3-4,281-288,,10.1080/21678421.2022.2136994,36287176,#1300,Xu 2023,,,1

Currently, the revised third edition was published to reflect recent evidence on the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of cholelithiasis conforming to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Following this revision, the present English version of the guidelines was updated and published herein. The clinical questions (CQ) in the previous version were reviewed and rearranged into three newly divided categories: background questions (BQ) dealing with basic background knowledge, CQ, and future research questions (FRQ), which refer to issues that require further accumulation of evidence. Finally, 52 questions (29 BQs, 19 CQs, and 4 FRQs) were adopted to cover the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, complications, and prognosis. Based on a literature search using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Igaku Chuo Zasshi databases for the period between 1983 and August 2019, along with a manual search of new information reported over the past 5 years, the level of evidence was evaluated for each CQ. The strengths of recommendations were determined using the Delphi method by the committee members considering the body of evidence, including benefits and harms, patient preference, and cost-benefit balance.

Usual Source of Care and Contraceptive Use.,Wells R; Smith NK,"BACKGROUND: A high proportion of people in the United States at risk of unintended pregnancy also have limited primary care access. STUDY DESIGN: We pooled data for analyses from separate 2015-2017 and 2017-2019 waves of the National Survey of Family Growth. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate associations between the usual source of health care and self-reported use of a comprehensive range of contraceptive options, as well as alignment between patient preference and the current method. RESULTS: Compared with having a private doctor or Health Maintenance Organization, not having a usual source of care was associated with lower odds of using short-term hormonal methods (OR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.40-0.73, for an 11 percentage point lower rate); higher odds of using time-based methods (OR=1.47, 95% CI: 1.10-1.97, for a 6 percentage point higher rate); and higher odds of preferring a contraceptive method other than the one most recently used (OR=1.39, 95% CI: 1.01-1.90, for a 6 percentage point higher probability). Reliance on an emergency department as a usual source of care was not associated with contraceptive use or satisfaction with the method used. Reliance on urgent care was associated only with higher odds of using time-based methods (OR=1.60, 95% CI: 1.03-2.50, for a 7 percentage point higher rate). Clinic-based usual care was not associated with any differences in contraceptive use but was associated with preferring a contraceptive method other than the one most recently used (OR=1.65, 95% CI: 1.21-2.25, for an 8 percentage point higher probability).

Exploring older peoples' attitudes and preferences around the use of their healthcare information.,Gonzalez-Prieto C; Wilson D; Dobbie G; Rivera-Rodriguez C; Yates S; Rai-Bala R; Sani T; Dobson R; Cullum S,"AIMS: Routinely collected health data can provide rich information for research and epidemiological monitoring of different diseases, but using the data presents many challenges. This study aims to explore the attitudes and preferences of people aged 55 and over regarding the use of their de-identified health data, and their concerns and comfort in different scenarios. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted with people aged 55 and over currently engaged with health services in a New Zealand health district during June-October 2022. The survey could be completed online or by telephone and was available in eight languages. RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of respondents knew that their health information was currently being used in the ways described in the scenarios, and between 80-87% felt comfortable or very comfortable with their data being used as described in the scenarios. In contrast, 4% (n=9) felt ""uncomfortable"" or ""very uncomfortable"" across all of the scenarios. Participants expressed concerns about data accuracy, privacy and confidentiality, security, transparency of use, consent, feedback and the risk of data being sold to commercial companies. Some participants identified situations where permission should be required to link data, including being used by people other than health professionals, containing sensitive health issues, or being used for commercial purposes. CONCLUSION: This study finds general support from patients for the use of their routinely collected data for secondary purposes as long as its use will benefit the population from which the data are taken. It also highlights the necessity of including the perspectives of different cultures in the collection, storage, use and analysis of health information, particularly concerning Māori cultural considerations.",2023,Sep,N Z Med J,136,1582,64-86,,,37708487,#875,Gonzalez-Prieto 2023,,,0

Telehealth may be a useful tool to deliver EIPC sustainably and equitably. Palliative care clinicians completed a survey regarding their perceptions of the barriers, facilitators, and benefits of using telehealth video visits for delivering EIPC for patients with advanced lung cancer. Forty-eight clinicians across 22 cancer centers completed the survey between May and July 2022. Most (91.7%) agreed that telehealth increases access to EIPC and simplifies the process for patients to receive EIPC (79.2%). Clinicians noted that the elderly, those in rural areas, and those with less-resourced backgrounds have greater difficulty using telehealth. Perceived barriers were largely patient-based factors, including technological literacy, internet and device availability, and patient preferences. Clinicians agreed that several organizational factors facilitated telehealth EIPC delivery, including technological infrastructure (85.4%), training (83.3%), and support from study coordinators (81.3%). Other barriers included systems-based factors, such as insurance reimbursement and out-of-state coverage restrictions. Patient-, organization-, and systems-based factors are all important to providing and improving access to telehealth EIPC services.

National trends in osteoporosis medication use among Medicare beneficiaries with and without Alzheimer's disease/related dementias.,Armstrong P; Kuo YF; Cram P; Westra J; Raji MA,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporotic fractures  are a leading cause of disability and premature death in the elderly. Patients with Alzheimer's and related dementia (ADRD) have high rates of osteoporosis (OP) and substantial risk of osteoporotic fractures. Yet research is sparse on trends and predictors of OP medication use in ADRD. METHODS: Medicare beneficiaries with OP aged ≥ 67 years have Medicare parts A/B/D without HMO from 2016 to 2018. Our outcome was receipt of OP medications in 2018. A multivariable logistic regression assessed association between ADRD and OP drug prescribing, adjusted for age, sex, race, region, Medicare entitlement, dual Medicaid eligibility, chronic conditions, number of provider visits/hospitalizations, and nursing home (NH) resident status. Age/ADRD and NH residency/ADRD interactions were tested. RESULTS: Our sample consisted of 47,871 people with OP and ADRD and 201,840 with OP without ADRD. OP drug use was 38.6% in ADRD patients vs. 52.7% in non-ADRD. After adjustment for demographics, chronic conditions, and previous hospitalizations/physician visits, the OR for OP drug in ADRD vs. non-ADRD was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.83-0.87). NH residents had lower odds for OP medication (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.58-0.64). There were significant interactions between ADRD and age, and between ADRD and NH residency. The OR for OP drug use associated with ADRD was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86-0.90) among community-dwelling elders and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.64-0.69) among NH residents.

The Place of Immune Reconstitution Therapy in the Management of Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis in France: An Expert Consensus.,De Sèze J; Suchet L; Mekies C; Manchon E; Labauge P; Guennoc AM; Defer G; Clavelou P; Castelnovo G; Bourre B; Bensa-Koscher C; Al Khedr A; Le Mao J; Villemur L; Bouée S; Luciani L; Vermersch P,"The treatment strategy in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) is a complex decision requiring individualization of treatment sequences to maximize clinical outcomes. Current local and international guidelines do not provide specific recommendation on the use of immune reconstitution therapy (IRT) as alternative to continuous immunosuppression in the management of RMS. The objective of the program was to provide consensus-based expert opinion on the optimal use of IRT in the management of RMS. A Delphi method was performed from May 2022 to July 2022. Nineteen clinical assertions were developed by a scientific committee and sent to 14 French clinical experts in MS alongside published literature. Two consecutive reproducible anonymous votes were conducted. Consensus on recommendations was achieved when more than 75% of the respondents agreed or disagreed with the clinical assertions. After the second round, consensus was achieved amongst 16 out of 19 propositions: 13 clinical assertions had a 100% consensus, 3 clinical assertions a consensus above 75% and 3 without consensus. Expert-agreed consensus is provided on topics related to the benefit of the early use of IRT from immunological and clinical perspectives, profiles of patients who may benefit most from the IRT strategy (e.g. patients with family planning, patient preference and lifestyle requirements).

The effect of geographic origin and destination on congenital heart disease outcomes: a retrospective cohort study.,Millen SM; Olsen CH; Flanagan RP; Scott JS; Dobson CP,"BACKGROUND: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a common and significant birth defect, frequently requiring surgical intervention. For beneficiaries of the Department of Defense, a new diagnosis of CHD may occur while living at rural duty stations. Choice of tertiary care center becomes a function of geography, referring provider recommendations, and patient preference. METHODS: Using billing data from the Military Health System over a 5-year period, outcomes for beneficiaries age < 10 years undergoing CHD surgery were compared by patient origin (rural versus urban residence) and the distance to treatment (patient's home and the treating tertiary care center). These beneficiaries include children of active duty, activated reserves, and federally activated National Guard service members. Analysis of the outcomes were adjusted for procedure complexity risk. Treatment centers were further stratified by annual case volume and whether they publicly reported results in the society of thoracic surgery (STS) outcomes database. RESULTS: While increasing distance was associated with the cost of admission, there was no associated risk of inpatient mortality, one year mortality, or increased length of stay. Likewise, rural origination was not significantly associated with target outcomes. Patients traveled farther for STS-reporting centers (STS-pr), particularly high-volume centers. Such high-volume centers (> 50 high complexity cases annually) demonstrated decreased one year mortality, but increased cost and length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings contribute to the national conversation of rural community medicine versus regionalized subspecialty care; separation of patients between rural areas and more urban locations for initial CHD surgical care does not increase their mortality risk. In fact, traveling to high volume centers may have an associated mortality benefit.",2023,Feb,BMC Cardiovasc Disord,23,1,99,,10.1186/s12872-023-03037-w,36814200,#1508,Millen 2023,,,0
Patient-Preference Diagnostics: Adapting Stated-Preference Methods to Inform Effective Shared Decision Making.,Gonzalez Sepulveda JM; Johnson FR; Reed SD; Muiruri C; Hutyra CA; Mather RC 3rd,"BACKGROUND: While clinical practice guidelines underscore the need to incorporate patient preferences in clinical decision making, incorporating meaningful assessment of patient preferences in clinical encounters is challenging. Structured approaches that combine quantitative patient preferences and clinical evidence could facilitate effective patient-provider communication and more patient-centric health care decisions. Adaptive conjoint or stated-preference approaches can identify individual preference parameters, but they can require a relatively large number of choice questions or simplifying assumptions about the error with which preferences are elicited. METHOD: We propose an approach to efficiently diagnose preferences of patients for outcomes of treatment alternatives by leveraging prior information on patient preferences to generate adaptive choice questions to identify a patient's proximity to known preference phenotypes. This information can be used for measuring sensitivity and specificity, much like any other diagnostic procedure. We simulated responses with varying levels of choice errors for hypothetical patients with specific preference profiles to measure sensitivity and specificity of a 2-question preference diagnostic. RESULTS: We identified 4 classes representing distinct preference profiles for patients who participated in a previous first-time anterior shoulder dislocation (FTASD) survey. Posterior probabilities of class membership at the end of a 2-question sequence ranged from 87% to 89%. We found that specificity and sensitivity of the 2-question sequences were robust to respondent errors. The questions appeared to have better specificity than sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that this approach could help diagnose patient preferences for treatments for a condition such as FTASD with acceptable precision using as few as 2 choice questions. Such preference-diagnostic tools could be used to improve and document alignment of treatment choices and patient preferences. HIGHLIGHTS: Approaches that combine patient preferences and clinical evidence can facilitate effective patient-provider communication and more patient-centric healthcare decisions. However, diagnosing individual-level preferences is challenging, and no formal diagnostic tools exist.We propose a structured approach to efficiently diagnose patient preferences based on prior information on the distribution of patient preferences in a population.We generated a 2-question test of preferences for the outcomes associated with the treatment of first-time anterior shoulder dislocation.The diagnosis of preferences can help physicians discuss relevant aspects of the treatment options and proactively address patient concerns during the clinical encounter.",2023,Feb,Med Decis Making,43,2,214-226,,10.1177/0272989X221115058,35904149,#1569,GonzalezSepulveda 2023,,,1
Preferences and decisional considerations relating to opioid agonist therapy among Ukrainian people who use drugs: A conjoint analysis survey.,Bromberg DJ; Madden LM; Fraenkel L; Muthulingam D; Rhoades D; Dvoriak S; Dumchev K; Pykalo I; Altice FL,"Scaling up opioid agonist therapies (OAT) is the most effective strategy to control combined HIV and opioid epidemics, especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA), where HIV incidence and mortality continue to increase. Patient concerns about OAT, however, have undermined scale-up. The objective of this study is to understand Ukrainian opioid use disorder patient preferences about OAT to guide the development of an evidence-informed decision aid for clinical decision-making. We conducted a conjoint-based choice (CBC) survey. Participants were asked to about their preferences relating to 7 attributes of OAT (cost, dosing frequency, concerns about withdrawal symptoms, adverse side effects, improvements in quality of life, precipitation of withdrawal and legislative requirements to be registered as a drug dependent person) and 20 attribute levels for receiving OAT under differing potential treatment constraints. Data were analyzed using Hierarchical Bayesian models. Using respondent-driven sampling and random sampling, we recruited 2,028 people who inject drugs with opioid use disorder. Relative importance (RIS) and partial-worth utility scores (PWUS) were used to assess preferences for attributes and thresholds within each attribute. Cost and dosing frequency were the most important attributes (RIS = 39.2% and RIS = 25.2%, respectively) to potential patients, followed by concerns about withdrawal symptoms (RIS = 10.8%), adverse side effects (RIS = 9.0%), quality-of-life improvement (RIS = 7.5%), precipitation of euphoria (5.2%) and requirement to be registered as a drug- dependent person (RIS = 3.1%). The monthly cost-threshold for willingness-to-pay was 1,900 UAH ($70 USD). In Ukraine, where both governmental and private OAT clinics have emerged and provide markedly different delivery strategies, preferences are mostly driven by out-of-pocket expenses, despite many patients being willing to pay for OAT. Programmatic demands (flexibility and ease of acquiring medications) remain an important consideration while for a minority, clinical concerns about withdrawal symptoms, adverse side effects and OAT impact on life play a smaller role.",2024,,PLOS Glob Public Health,4,1,e0002725,,10.1371/journal.pgph.0002725,38277422,#453,Bromberg 2024,,,1
Atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation in patients hospitalised for stroke in the REGIONS Care Study.,Ranta S; Stewart R; Thompson S; Davis A; Barber PA; Harwood M; Ranta A,"AIM: To describe atrial fibrillation (AF) patient characteristics and anticoagulation patterns in stroke patients in Aotearoa. METHODS: Reducing Ethnic and Geographic Inequities to Optimise New Zealand Stroke (REGIONS) Care study is a prospective, nation-wide observational study of consecutive adult stroke patients admitted to hospital between 1 May and 31 October 2018. AF and anticoagulation prescribing, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and differences by Māori ethnicity and hospital location are described. RESULTS: Of 2,379 patients, 807 (34.3%) had a diagnosis of AF. AF patients were older than non-AF patients (mean 79.9 [SD 11] versus 72.5 [14.2], p<0.0001). AF was diagnosed before stroke in 666 patients (82.5%), of whom 442 (66.4%) were taking an anticoagulant. The most common documented reasons for non-anticoagulation were prior bleeding (20.5%), patient preference (18.1%), frailty, comorbidities/side effects (13.2%) and falls (6.8%). The ICH rate was similar for AF patients on versus not on an anticoagulant (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-1.80). Rates and reasons for oral anticoagulant non-prescribing were similar for Māori, non-Māori, urban and non-urban populations. CONCLUSIONS: Although anticoagulation prescribing in AF has improved, one third of stroke patients with known AF were not taking an anticoagulant prior to admission and the majority did not appear to have an absolute contraindication offering a multidisciplinary opportunity for improvement. There were no significant differences for Māori and non-urban populations in anticoagulant prescribing.",2023,Aug,N Z Med J,136,1580,12-25,,,37536308,#991,Ranta 2023,,,0

This study aims to identify perceptions of informed consent practices for health data capture, access, and use in Gauteng and the Western Cape provinces of South Africa. Data collection from September to December 2021 included in-depth interviews with healthcare providers (n = 12) and women (n = 62) attending maternity services. Study findings suggest that most patients were not aware that their data were being used for purposes beyond the individualised provision of medical care. Understanding the concept of anonymised use of electronic health data was at times challenging for patients who understood their data in the limited context of paper-based folders and booklets. When asked about preferences for electronic data, patients overwhelmingly were in favour of digitisation. They viewed electronic access to their health data as facilitating rapid and continuous access to health information. Patients were additionally asked about preferences, including delivery of health information, onward health data use, and recontacting. Understanding of these use cases varied and was often challenging to convey to participants who understood their health data in the context of information inputted into their paper folders.

Long-term oncological outcomes after local excision of T1 rectal cancer.,Leijtens JWA; Smits LJH; Koedam TWA; Orsini RG; van Aalten SM; Verseveld M; Doornebosch PG; de Graaf EJR; Tuynman JB,"BACKGROUND: A growing proportion of patients with early rectal cancer is treated by local excision only. The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term oncological outcomes and the impact of local recurrence on overall survival for surgical local excision in pT1 rectal cancer. METHODS: Patients who only underwent local excision for pT1 rectal cancer between 1997 and 2014 in two Dutch tertiary referral hospitals were included in this retrospective cohort study. The primary outcome was the local recurrence rate. Secondary outcomes were distant recurrence, overall survival and the impact of local recurrence on overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients (mean age 68.5 ± 10.7 years, 57.3% males) were included in the study. Median length of follow-up was 58.9 months (range 6-176 months). Local recurrence occurred in 22.7% (n = 34) of the patients, with a median time to local recurrence of 11.1 months (range 2.3-82.6 months). The vast majority of local recurrences were located in the lumen. Five-year overall survival was 82.0%, and landmark analyses showed that local recurrence significantly impacted overall survival at 6 and 36 months of follow-up (6 months, p = 0.034, 36 months, p = 0.036).

Patient preferences and shared decision making for the traditional Chinese medicine treatment of lung cancer: A discrete choice experiment study.,Teng Y; Wei Y; Chen Y; Yan J; Liu S; Li F; Bao S; Ren Y; Liu L; Yang Y,"BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), integrating patient preferences into decision-making process, has been widely used in the multimodality therapy of lung cancer. This study aimed to estimate patient preferences for treatment and shared decision-making (SDM) modes concerning inpatient TCM treatment of lung cancer in Shanghai in order to provide a basis for clinical decision-making process on TCM therapy for lung cancer. METHODS: This study was conducted among patients (n = 347) from nine tertiary hospitals in Shanghai by discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey and Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire-patient version (SDM-Q-9) survey. The DCE was developed with the inclusion of the most relevant attributes at appropriate levels for the TCM treatment of lung cancer. The empirical data analyses of patients were performed using mixed logit models. Additionally, subgroup analysis was conducted. RESULTS: In total, 347 respondents completed the questionnaire. All attributes' coefficients were statistically significant for patients' preferences. Patients showed strong preferences for increasing disease control rate, relieving nausea and vomiting, reducing the risk of side effects, and were concerned about monthly out-of-pocket costs. Subgroup analysis indicated that patients with a lower SDM-Q-9 score and those who were satisfied with medical services emphasized more importance of higher disease control rate. Furthermore, most of the patients (90.20%) self-reported a high willingness to use SDM during the decision-making process. CONCLUSION: In Shanghai, patients mainly preferred SDM and considered disease control rate as the most essential attribute in the TCM treatment of lung cancer. The study findings could underscore the importance of considering patients' preferences and promote SDM.",2023,Sep,Integr Med Res,12,3,100969,,10.1016/j.imr.2023.100969,37546234,#906,Teng 2023,,,1
Engaging Men of Diverse Racial and Ethnic Groups With Advanced Prostate Cancer in the Design of an mHealth Diet and Exercise Intervention: Focus Group Study.,Wang EY; Borno HT; Washington Iii SL; Friedlander T; Zhang S; Trejo E; Van Blarigan EL; Chan JM; Shariff-Marco S; Beatty AL; Kenfield SA,"BACKGROUND: Healthy diet and exercise can improve quality of life and prognosis among men with prostate cancer. Understanding the perceived barriers to lifestyle change and patient preferences in a diverse cohort of men with prostate cancer is necessary to inform mobile health (mHealth) lifestyle interventions and increase health equity. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a multisite study to understand the preferences, attitudes, and health behaviors related to diet and lifestyle in this patient population. This report focuses on the qualitative findings from 4 web-based focus groups comprising a racially and ethnically diverse group of patients with advanced prostate cancer who are on androgen deprivation therapy. METHODS: We used grounded theory analyses including open, axial, and selective coding to generate codes. Qualitative data were analyzed as a whole rather than by focus group to optimize data saturation and the transferability of results. We present codes and themes that emerged for lifestyle intervention design and provide recommendations and considerations for future mHealth intervention studies. RESULTS: Overall, 14 men participated in 4 racially and ethnically concordant focus groups (African American or Black: 3/14, 21%; Asian American: 3/14, 21%; Hispanic or Latino: 3/14, 21%; and White: 5/14, 36%). Analyses converged on 7 interwoven categories: context (home environment, access, competing priorities, and lifestyle programs), motivation (accountability, discordance, feeling supported, fear, and temptation), preparedness (health literacy, technological literacy, technological preferences, trust, readiness to change, identity, adaptability, and clinical characteristics), data-driven design (education, psychosocial factors, and quality of life), program mechanics (communication, materials, customization, and being holistic), habits (eg, dietary habits), and intervention impressions. These results suggest actionable pathways to increase program intuitiveness. Recommendations for future mHealth intervention design and implementation include but are not limited to assessment at the individual, household, and neighborhood levels to support a tailored intervention; prioritization of information to disseminate based on individuals' major concerns and the delivery of information based on health and technological literacy and communication preferences; prescribing a personalized intervention based on individuals' baseline responses, home and neighborhood environment, and support network; and incorporating strategies to foster engagement (eg, responsive and relevant feedback systems) to aid participant decision-making and behavior change. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing a patient's social context, motivation, and preparedness is necessary when tailoring a program to each patient's needs in all racial and ethnic groups. Addressing the patients' contexts and motivation and preparedness related to diet and exercise including the household, access (to food and exercise), competing priorities, health and technological literacy, readiness to change, and clinical characteristics will help to customize the intervention to the participant. These data support a tailored approach leveraging the identified components and their interrelationships to ensure that mHealth lifestyle interventions will engage and be effective in racially and ethnically diverse patients with cancer.

Patient decisions regarding cancer gene panel testing: An exploratory study.,Emmet MM; Chang Y; Chung DC; Caruso AR; Shannon KM,"This study examined factors associated with the selection of a specific multi-gene panel test by patients in a cancer genetic counseling clinic. We surveyed patients who received pre-test genetic counseling at the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Cancer Risk Assessment (CCRA) in 2019 and their genetic counselors to assess demographic and clinical characteristics, patient concerns, and session outcome. Ultimately, 228 eligible participants completed the survey, of whom 85.1% consented to genetic testing. Of those who chose testing, 56.2% selected the largest panel type available, a pan-cancer panel that included both actionable and inactionable genes. White patients were more likely than non-white patients to pursue testing. Among testers, number of testing options offered, participant educational attainment, age, and NCCN Guidelines status were associated with patient choice between four panel options. Some patient concerns, including impact of results on future cancer screening and family dynamics, were also linked to test choice. Several other participant characteristics including income, cancer diagnosis, and family structure did not appear to be predictive of testing choice. Our results confirmed the patient preference for large gene panels and identified a limited number of associations between patient characteristics and concerns and testing choice. We noted however that a significant number of participants did not choose the most commonly selected test, and that test choice is difficult to predict based on clinical and demographic factors. Our results also provide further evidence of well-documented disparities in cancer genetic testing. Study limitations do not allow our findings to be generalized to all cancer genetic counseling patients. Further research is needed to examine how and why patients choose between multiple genetic test options in the cancer setting. This study was one of the first to examine patient choice between a full spectrum of multi-gene panel options.",2023,Nov,J Genet Couns,,,,,10.1002/jgc4.1824,37950555,#687,Emmet 2023,,,0

Patient Choice and Motivators: Should Behavioral Economics Inform The Plan of Care?,Studer M; Shubert TE,,2024,Apr,Phys Ther,104,4,,,10.1093/ptj/pzae009,38280220,#178,Studer 2024,"Martina Di Blasio  (2024-06-01 07:36:52)(Screen): Extract
Patients who participate in their plan of care are more likely to achieve their optimal outcomes. Physical therapists rarely receive training in the science of how humans make decisions, especially how to facilitate the decision to engage in physical therapy.

Over the past 20 years, there has been a shift from treating a patient’s physical symptoms to a more patient-centered approach, incorporating multiple perspectives into the rehabilitation experience and partnering with the patient to achieve their health outcomes. Recognizing this, many physical therapists receive training on principles of behavior change to ensure alignment between the plan of care and the individual’s stage of change.1 During the actual intervention, physical therapists are encouraged to incorporate psychologically informed care into their practice. This model proposes that incorporating a patient’s beliefs, attitudes, and emotional responses into their rehabilitation experience may support enhanced participation, resulting in improved outcomes and minimizing the risk of secondary disability and activity limitations.2; ",,0
Pretesting Discrete-Choice Experiments: A Guide for Researchers.,Campoamor NB; Guerrini CJ; Brooks WB; Bridges JFP; Crossnohere NL,"Discrete-choice experiments (DCEs) are a frequently used method to explore the preferences of patients and other decision-makers in health. Pretesting is an essential stage in the design of a high-quality choice experiment and involves engaging with representatives of the target population to improve the readability, presentation, and structure of the preference instrument. The goal of pretesting in DCEs is to improve the validity, reliability, and relevance of the survey, while decreasing sources of bias, burden, and error associated with preference elicitation, data collection, and interpretation of the data. Despite its value to inform DCE design, pretesting lacks documented good practices or clearly reported applied examples. The purpose of this paper is: (1) to define pretesting and describe the pretesting process specifically in the context of a DCE, (2) to present a practical guide and pretesting interview discussion template for researchers looking to conduct a rigorous pretest of a DCE, and (3) to provide an illustrative example of how these resources were operationalized to inform the design of a complex DCE aimed at eliciting tradeoffs between personal privacy and societal benefit in the context of a police method known as investigative genetic genealogy (IGG).",2024,Mar,Patient,17,2,109-120,,10.1007/s40271-024-00672-z,38363501,#286,Campoamor 2024,,,1
Physician factors affecting patient preferences in selecting a primary care provider: A qualitative research study in Singapore.,Lee AEJ; Ithinin S; Tan NC,"BACKGROUND: Care continuity by a dedicated, well-trained primary care physician (PCP) has shown to improve health outcomes of patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs). In Singapore's fee-for-service primary care system, patients can choose to consult any PCP in either a public (polyclinic), private (General Practitioners/ GP), or both types of clinics, resulting in potential fragmented care. Decision-making by patients in selecting their preferred PCP remains unclear. This study aims to explore the personal factors influencing the choice of PCP among patients with NCDs in primary care. METHODS: This qualitative research study was conducted in a typical polyclinic. In-depth interviews were conducted on patients with NCDs. Purposive sampling was implemented to enrol patients who had previously consulted PCPs in polyclinics and GP clinics, garnering their perspectives and experiences of care received from both providers. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and audited. Data was coded and analysed using thematic content analysis to identify emerging themes. The physician-specific factors which influence patients' decision-making of PCP selection are presented here. RESULTS: Twenty-one Asian patients aged 38 to 82 years were interviewed. They preferred PCPs with an approachable and genuine demeanour, exhibiting empathy and compassion. They valued the PCPs' verbal, non-verbal and listening skills. Regarding professional qualities, patients wanted PCPs to demonstrate competency and a patient-centred care approach. Some selected their PCP based on compatible age and gender that they felt comfortable with. Establishing good rapport with their PCP and maintaining continuity of care were deemed as major factors in patients' PCP selection. CONCLUSION: Patients tended to select PCPs based on their personal characteristics, interpersonal skills, professional attributes, demographics, and the physician-patient relationship. PCPs should be aware of these attributes and demonstrate them during their patient interaction. Leveraging on this enables PCPs to build rapport with their patients and maintain care continuity to optimize their health outcomes.",2024,,PLoS One,19,3,e0298823,,10.1371/journal.pone.0298823,38427651,#281,LeeAEJ 2024,,,0

AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate stakeholders' values and preferences regarding draft recommendations for adapted physical restraint guidelines in China. STUDY DESIGN: This survey research was carried out at four university-affiliated comprehensive hospitals based in the eastern, central, western, and north eastern zones of China from January 5-30, 2022. A 48-item self-report questionnaire was distributed, and values and preferences were assessed on a 10-point Likert scale. One-way ANOVA was used to compare values and preference scores among stakeholders. As effect-size measures, partial η(2) and Cohen's f values are reported for ANOVA results. RESULTS: A total of 1155 stakeholders were enrolled in the study. The mean value and preference scores were higher than seven for 46 draft recommendations. There was either no significant difference in the values and preferences of the stakeholders for the draft recommendations or there was a significant difference (p values ranged from <0.001 ∼ .048), but the effect size was small or very small (partial η(2) value ranged from 0.011 ∼ .044; Cohen's f value ranged from 0.101 ∼ .214). The mean scores of patients for items related to cyber therapy and early tracheotomy were 6.84 and 6.60, respectively, which were lower than those of family members, policy-makers, and health care professionals and were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The partial η(2) and Cohen's f values of the effect size were 0.083/0.062 and 0.302/0.256, respectively, which indicated that the differences were moderate. CONCLUSION: These recommendations were in line with the values and preferences of stakeholders. Patients were more supportive of implementing cyber therapy or hypnosis for pain management but did not support early tracheotomy to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation.

Racial and ethnic inequities in the quality of paediatric care in the USA: a review of quantitative evidence.,Slopen N; Chang AR; Johnson TJ; Anderson AT; Bate AM; Clark S; Cohen A; Jindal M; Karbeah J; Pachter LM; Priest N; Suglia SF; Bryce N; Fawcett A; Heard-Garris N,"Racial and ethnic inequities in paediatric care have received increased research attention over the past two decades, particularly in the past 5 years, alongside an increased societal focus on racism. In this Series paper, the first in a two-part Series focused on racism and child health in the USA, we summarise evidence on racial and ethnic inequities in the quality of paediatric care. We review studies published between Jan 1, 2017 and July 31, 2022, that are adjusted for or stratified by insurance status to account for group differences in access, and we exclude studies in which differences in access are probably driven by patient preferences or the appropriateness of intervention. Overall, the literature reveals widespread patterns of inequitable treatment across paediatric specialties, including neonatology, primary care, emergency medicine, inpatient and critical care, surgery, developmental disabilities, mental health care, endocrinology, and palliative care. The identified studies indicate that children from minoritised racial and ethnic groups received poorer health-care services relative to non-Hispanic White children, with most studies drawing on data from multiple sites, and accounting for indicators of family socioeconomic position and clinical characteristics (eg, comorbidities or condition severity). The studies discussed a range of potential causes for the observed disparities, including implicit biases and differences in site of care or clinician characteristics. We outline priorities for future research to better understand and address paediatric treatment inequities and implications for practice and policy. Policy changes within and beyond the health-care system, discussed further in the second paper of this Series, are essential to address the root causes of treatment inequities and to promote equitable and excellent health for all children.",2024,Feb,Lancet Child Adolesc Health,8,2,147-158,,10.1016/S2352-4642(23)00251-1,38242597,#409,Slopen 2024,,,0
Patient preferences for attributes of injected or infused preventive migraine medications: Findings from a discrete choice experiment.,Schwedt TJ; Martin A; Kymes S; Talon B; Lee XY; Cady R; Asher D; Karnik-Henry M; Mulvihill E; Bates D; Beusterien K,"OBJECTIVE: To assess preferences among adults with migraine for differentiating attributes of injected or infused preventive treatment options and evaluate their importance in determining a treatment choice. BACKGROUND: Adults with migraine and health-care providers consider many factors when making treatment decisions. Injected or infused preventive migraine treatment options differ in several attributes, including mode of administration and dosing frequency, which may be preferentially selected or avoided by patients. Understanding a patient's preference is important for clinicians as they advise on various treatment options. METHODS: A total of 604 US adults diagnosed with migraine participated in an online survey that captured information on demographics, migraine history, and treatment preferences. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was used to evaluate participants' preferences for specific attributes of injected/infused preventive migraine therapies. The DCE data were utilized to estimate attribute importance (expressed as a percentage) and identify subgroups that had different distributions of preferences. RESULTS: In the overall migraine population, mode of administration (28.8%), durability of effectiveness (27.0%), and speed of onset (25.5%) had the highest relative importance, whereas administration setting (9.9%) and dosing frequency (8.8%) had the lowest. Four distinct subgroups were identified: Group 1 (n = 128) preferred self-injection administration and durability of effectiveness; Group 2 (n = 189) expressed aversion to cranial injections; Group 3 (n = 158) prioritized rapid speed of onset; and Group 4 (n = 129) favored health-care provider administration and durability of effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Speed of onset, durability of effectiveness, and mode of administration are key moderators of treatment preference among US adults with migraine. Certain segments of the migraine population prioritize specific treatment attributes over others, with intravenous infusion not considered a barrier in three of four identified segments. Clinicians can best help their patients find the right medication if they understand which medication attributes are most and least important to them.",2023,Apr,Headache,63,4,484-493,,10.1111/head.14476,36753057,#1362,Schwedt 2023,,,1

What attributes of abortion care affect people's decision-making? Results from a discrete choice experiment.,Seymour JW; Higgins JA; Roberts SCM,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to measure both stated and experimentally ""revealed"" abortion provision preferences among US people with capacity for pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: In July 2022, we recruited US residents assigned female sex at birth and aged 18 to 55 years using Prolific, an online survey hosting platform. We asked participants what first-trimester abortion method and delivery model they would prefer. We also assessed abortion care preferences with a discrete choice experiment, which examined the relative importance of the following care attributes: method, distance, wait time for appointment, delivery model (telehealth vs in-clinic), and cost. RESULTS: More than half of the 887 respondents (59%) self-reported a slight (22%) or strong (37%) preference for medication compared to aspiration abortion; 11% stated no preference. Our discrete choice experiment found that cost and wait time had a greater effect on hypothetical decision-making than did method and delivery model (discrete choice experiment average importances = 44.3 and 23.2, respectively, compared to 15.9 and 8.2, respectively). Simulations indicated that holding other attributes constant, respondents preferred medication to aspiration abortion and telehealth to in-clinic care. CONCLUSIONS: This study, the first to examine abortion preferences in the United States, using a discrete choice experiment, demonstrates the importance of wait time and cost in abortion care decision-making. Our work indicates that for this population, factors related to health care financing and organization may matter more than clinical aspects of care. IMPLICATIONS: Although people in this study preferred medication to aspiration abortion and telehealth to in-clinic care, wait time and cost of care played a greater role in care decision-making. Focusing solely on clinical aspects of care (i.e., method, delivery model) may ignore other attributes of care that are particularly important for potential patients.",2024,Mar,Contraception,131,,110327,,10.1016/j.contraception.2023.110327,37979644,#309,Seymour 2024,,,1

Participants chose which CRS symptom recall period (1 day, 2 weeks, 1 month, >1 month) was most reflective of their current disease state and upon which to best base treatment recommendations (including surgery). Participants also chose which of six response scales (one visual analogue scale and five Likert scales ranging from four to eight items) was easiest to use, understand, and preferred. RESULTS: A plurality of participants (40.0%) felt their CRS symptoms' current state was best reflected by a 1-month recall period. However, most patients (56.9%) preferred treatment recommendations to be determined by symptoms experienced over a >1 month period. The four- and five-item Likert scales were the easiest to understand (26.0% and 25.4%, respectively) and use (23.4% and 26.7%, respectively). The five-item (26.4% rating it most preferred and 70.9% rating it preferred) and four-item Likert (22.3% rating it most preferred and 56.4% rating it preferred) response scales were most preferred. CONCLUSION: Future PROMs for CRS should consider assessment of symptoms over a 1-month period and use a four- or five-item Likert response scale to reflect global patient preferences. These findings also inform interpretation of current CRS PROMs.",2023,Oct,Int Forum Allergy Rhinol,,,,,10.1002/alr.23280,37788156,#797,Sedaghat 2023,,,0
Comparison of patient preferences and responsiveness among common patient-reported outcome measures for hand/wrist injuries or disorders.,Chanthana P; Atthakomol P; Manosroi W; Wongpakaran T; Kraisarin J; Sananpanich K,"BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were developed to examine patients' perceptions of functional health. Most studies compare the responsiveness of each type of questionnaire. However, reports of patient preferences among PROMs commonly used with patients with hand/wrist injuries or disorders are limited. This study aimed to compare patient preferences, factors associated with those preferences and responsiveness among the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ), Patient-Rated Wrist/Hand Evaluation (PRWHE) and EQ-5D in patients with hand/wrist injuries or disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study collected data on 183 patients with hand/wrist injuries or diseases who had visited a hand/wrist outpatient clinic or were hospitalized for surgery between 2017 and 2020. Patients had to be at least 18 years old and able to complete the four questionnaires included in the study. The four PROMs (DASH, MHQ, PRWHE and EQ-5D) were administered to the patients prior to treatment. After completing the questionnaires, patients were asked to answer two open-ended questions regarding their preferences. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify factors related to patient preferences. Results are presented as the relative risk ratio (RRR). The standardized response mean (SRM) was used to evaluate questionnaire responsiveness. RESULTS: Of the 183 patients, most preferred the PRWHE questionnaire (n = 74, 41%), with the main reasons cited being ""specific to injuries/diseases and reflects hand/wrist function (n = 23, 31%)"" and ""easy to complete (n = 22, 30%)."" Sex was found to be associated with patient preference after adjusting for demographic data and reasons for choosing a PROM as confounders (RRR = 0.46, P value = 0.049). The PRWHE had the highest SRM, followed by DASH (0.92 and 0.88, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The PRWHE is the most preferred by patients and is the most responsive questionnaire. It is recommended for use in clinical practice in situations where a clinician would like to use only one PROM for evaluating patients with various types of hand/wrist problems.

Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (ESG) Versus Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (LSG): A Comparative Review.,Nduma BN; Mofor KA; Tatang J; Amougou L; Nkeonye S; Chineme P; Ekhator C; Ambe S,"Obesity is one of the most debilitating conditions. In a quest to mitigate disease severity, various interventions have been proposed, with endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) and laparoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (LSG) being among the recent interventions that have received growing attention. This systematic review sought to conduct a comparative analysis regarding the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of both interventions. The study involved a systematic review in which key search engines were used to select articles documented and published in the last decade. The articles for inclusion were those existing as peer-reviewed studies touching upon the aforementioned subject, with both controlled and uncontrolled trials included. Furthermore, there was the implementation of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol that governs systematic reviews, in which the article selection process entailed four key procedures in the form of identification, screening, determining eligibility, and the inclusion process. In the findings, the selected articles documented mixed outcomes, but a common denominator was that the safety profile of ESG tends to be superior to that of LSG due to the observations that ESG comes with fewer adverse events such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and severe nausea and vomiting. However, the majority of the studies contended that LSG proved superior to ESG in terms of effectiveness and efficacy. Hence, individuals with mild-to-moderate obesity are more likely to benefit from ESG, but those with severe obesity whose goal is to achieve long-term weight management might benefit more from LSG. In conclusion, the management of obesity and the decision to employ ESG or LSG ought to be patient-centered and dictated by factors such as patient preferences, safety, and the sustainability of the devised plan of care.",2023,Jul,Cureus,15,7,e41466,,10.7759/cureus.41466,37426405,#1073,Nduma 2023,,,0
Caring as the unacknowledged matrix of evidence-based nursing.,Wang VM; Baigrie B,"In this article, we explicate evidence-based nursing (EBN), critically appraise its framework and respond to nurses' concern that EBN sidelines the caring elements of nursing practice. We use resources from care ethics, especially Vrinda Dalmiya's work that considers care as crucial for both epistemology and ethics, to show how EBN is compatible with, and indeed can be enhanced by, the caring aspects of nursing practice. We demonstrate that caring can act as a bridge between 'external' evidence and the other pillars of the EBN framework: clinical expertise; patient preferences and values. Drawing on an influential EBN handbook, section 1 presents the aims and features of EBN, including the normative principle that EBN should take place within a 'context of caring'. We aim to understand this context and whether it can be neatly detached from the EBN framework, as the handbook seems to suggest. In section 2, we highlight the grounds for resistance to EBN from the nursing community, before mounting the argument that nursing practices can be understood fruitfully through feminist care ethics and/or virtue ethics lenses. In section 3, we deepen that analysis using Dalmiya's concepts of care-knowing and care as a hybrid ethico-epistemic virtue, which are ideally suited to the complex practices of nursing. In section 4, we bring this rich understanding of care into conversation with EBN, showing that its framework cannot be adequately theorised without paying proper attention to care. Caring can be neither an innocuous background assumption of nor an afterthought to the EBN framework.",2023,Nov,J Med Ethics,,,,,10.1136/jme-2023-109472,37968107,#684,Wang 2023,,,0
Regional control after precision lymph node dissection for clinically evident melanoma metastasis.,Lynch KT; Hu Y; Farrow NE; Song Y; Meneveau MO; Kwak M; Lowe MC; Bartlett EK; Beasley GM; Karakousis GC; Slingluff CL,"INTRODUCTION: Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for microscopic lymph node metastases has been replaced by observation; however, CLND is standard for clinically detectable nodal metastases (cLN). CLND has high morbidity, which may be reduced by excision of only the cLN (precision lymph node dissection [PLND]). We hypothesized that same-basin recurrence risk would be low after PLND. METHODS: Retrospective review at four tertiary care hospitals identified patients who underwent PLND. The primary outcome was 3-year cumulative incidence of isolated same-basin recurrence. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients underwent PLND for cLN without synchronous distant metastases. Reasons for forgoing CLND included patient preference (n = 11), comorbidities (n = 5), imaging indeterminate for distant metastases (n = 2), partial response to checkpoint blockade (n = 1), or not reported (n = 2). A median of 2 nodes (range: 1-6) were resected at PLND, and 68% contained melanoma. Recurrence was observed in 33% overall. Only 1 patient (5%) developed an isolated same-basin recurrence. Cumulative incidences at 3 years were 5.0%, 17.3%, and 49.7% for isolated same-basin recurrence, any same-basin recurrence, and any recurrence, respectively. Complications from PLND were reported in 1 patient (5%). CONCLUSIONS: These pilot data suggest that PLND may provide adequate regional disease control with less morbidity than CLND. These data justify prospective evaluation of PLND in select patients.",2023,Jan,J Surg Oncol,127,1,140-147,,10.1002/jso.27100,36115028,#1657,Lynch 2023,,,0
Factors Affecting Recurrence of Idiopathic Granulomatous Mastitis: A Systematic Review.,Fattahi AS; Amini G; Sajedi F; Mehrad-Majd H,"Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is a rare and benign disease that primarily affects young women of reproductive age. Various factors have been suggested as possible causes, including pregnancy, breastfeeding, history of taking birth control pills, hyperprolactinemia, smoking, and history of trauma. Due to unknown etiology, opinions on its treatment have varied, resulting in differing recurrence rates and side effects. Therefore, conducting a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis can aid in understanding the causes and recurrence of the disease, thereby assisting in the selection of effective treatment and improving the quality of life. A systematic literature review was conducted using predefined search terms to identify eligible studies related to risk factors and recurrence up to June 2022 from electronic databases. Data were extracted and subjected to meta-analysis when applicable. A total of 71 studies with 4735 patients were included. The mean age of the patients was 34.98 years, and the average mass size was 4.64 cm. About 3749 of these patients (79.17%) were Caucasian. Patients who mentioned a history of pregnancy were 92.65% with 76.57%, 22.7%, and 19.7% having a history of breastfeeding, taking contraceptive pills, and high prolactin levels, respectively. Around 5.6% of patients had previous trauma. The overall recurrence rate was 17.18%, with recurrence rates for treatments as follows: surgery (22.5%), immunosuppressive treatment (14.7%), combined treatment (14.9%), antibiotic treatment (6.74%), and observation (9.4%). Only antibiotic and expectant treatments had significant differences in recurrence rates compared to other treatments (p value = 0.023). In conclusion, factors such as Caucasian race, pregnancy and breastfeeding history, and use of contraceptive hormone are commonly associated with the disease recurrence. Treatment should be tailored based on symptom severity and patient preference, with surgery or immunosuppressive options for recurrence.",2023,,Breast J,2023,,9947797,,10.1155/2023/9947797,37794976,#857,Fattahi 2023,,,0
Translation and Cultural Adaptation of the Preferences for Everyday Living Inventory for Korean Nursing Home Settings.,Shin SY; Kwon JH,"Valid and reliable measures are necessary to provide person-centered care. However, there are no such measures in Korean nursing home (NH) settings. The purpose of the current study was to translate and culturally adapt the Preferences for Everyday Living Inventory (PELI) into Korean following the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research guidelines. Face validity was assessed by cognitively capable Korean older adults (N = 10) using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree). Mean score was 2.7 (SD = 0.82) for grammar and wording; 3.7 (SD = 0.48) for understandability; and 3.7 (SD = 0.67) for cultural relevance. Participants found the Korean version of the PELI (PELI-K) easy to understand and interpret, and culturally relevant. Results suggest that the PELI was successfully translated and culturally adapted to Korean. Implementing the PELI-K in Korean NHs and incorporating individual preferences into care delivery will improve quality of care.

Patients' Preferences for Connected Insulin Pens: A Discrete Choice Experiment Among Patients with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.,Seo J; Heidenreich S; Aldalooj E; Poon JL; Spaepen E; Eby EL; Newson RS,"BACKGROUND: This study quantified how people with diabetes value the unique features of connected insulin pens and related mobile apps, and the underlying reasons for preferring connected versus non-connected insulin pens. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in the USA and UK to elicit preferences of adults (≥ 18 years) with type 1 or 2 diabetes for attributes of insulin pens. Attributes included device type, dosing support, glucose monitoring, additional app features, and data sharing. Relative attribute importance (RAI) scores were calculated to capture the relative importance of an attribute. Predicted choice probabilities were obtained to compare different profiles for connected and non-connected insulin pens. RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 540 participants (58.9% male; 90.7% Caucasian; mean age, 58.3 years; 69.4% type 2 diabetes). Participants most valued the possibility of using a connected insulin pen with dosing support and automated dose logging (RAI = 39.9%), followed by automatic transfer of glucose levels (RAI = 29.0%), additional features of tracking diet and physical activity (RAI = 14.6%), data sharing (RAI = 13.6%), and device type (RAI = 2.9%). All profiles of connected insulin pens were preferred over a non-connected pen (p < 0.001), and pen profiles with advanced features were preferred over those without (p < 0.001). Preferences differed by age but not diabetes type, country of residence, or insulin regimen. CONCLUSION: People with diabetes in the USA and UK prefer connected over non-connected insulin pens due largely to the availability of automated logging of dose and glucose levels.",2023,Mar,Patient,16,2,127-138,,10.1007/s40271-022-00610-x,36437389,#1474,Seo 2023,,,1
Patient perspectives on repeated contrast-enhanced mammography and magnetic resonance during neoadjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer.,Pires-Gonçalves L; Henriques Abreu M; Ferrão A; Guimarães Dos Santos A; Aguiar AT; Gouvêa M; Henrique R,"BACKGROUND: The burden perceived by the patient of repeated imaging required for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) monitoring warrants attention due to the increased use of NAC and imaging. PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the experienced burden associated with repeated contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during NAC for breast cancer from the patient perspective. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Approval from the ethics committee and written informed consent were obtained. In this prospective study, CEM and MRI were performed on 38 patients with breast cancer before, during, and after NAC in a tertiary cancer center. The experienced burden was evaluated with a self-reported questionnaire addressing duration, comfort, anxiety, positioning, and intravenous contrast administration, each measured on a 5-point Likert scale. The participants were asked their preference between CEM or MRI. Statistical comparisons were performed and P<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Most participants (n = 29, 76%) preferred CEM over MRI (P = 0.0008). CEM was associated with a significantly shorter duration (P < 0.001), greater overall comfort (P < 0.01), more comfortable positioning (P = 0.01), and lower anxiety (P = 0.03). Intravenous contrast administration perception revealed no significant difference. Only 4 (10%) participants preferred MRI over CEM, due to the absence of breast compression. CONCLUSION: In the hypothetical scenario of equal diagnostic accuracy, most participants preferred CEM and compared CEM favorably to MRI in all investigated features at repeated imaging required for NAC response assessment. Our results indicate that repeated examinations with CEM is well tolerated and constitutes a patient-friendly alternative for NAC imaging monitoring in breast cancer.",2023,May,Acta Radiol,64,5,1816-1822,,10.1177/02841851221144021,36575580,#1296,Pires-Gonçalves 2023,,,0
How Schroth Therapists Vary the Implementation of Schroth Worldwide for Adolescents with Idiopathic Scoliosis: A Mixed Methods Study.,Marchese R; Ilhan E; Pacey V,"(1) Background: Schroth is a type of physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercise (PSSE) prescribed to adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Studies have investigated the effectiveness of Schroth but are yet to elucidate how Schroth is applied clinically and the factors that influence their prescription. (2) Methods: A mixed methods design was used comprising an anonymous survey and semi-structured interviews of Schroth therapists who treated AIS and who were publicly listed on the Barcelona Scoliosis Physical Therapy School or the International Schroth 3-dimensional Scoliosis Therapy School websites. The survey included 64 questions covering demographics, session and treatment characteristics, and whether therapists included other treatment modalities in their clinical practice. A convenience sample of survey participants were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview to further explore the factors that influenced their prescription of Schroth for AIS. Results from the survey were analyzed descriptively (n, %), whereas inductive thematic analysis was used for the interviews. (3) Results: of the 173 survey respondents (18% response rate), most were from Europe and North America (64.0%), female (78.6%), physiotherapists (96.0%), and worked in private settings (72.3%). Fifty-two per cent of participants used other types of PSSE as an adjunct to Schroth, the Scientific Exercise Approach to Scoliosis (SEAS) being the most frequently used (37.9%). Non-PSSE methods were used 'at some point' as an adjunct by 98.8% of participants, including massage and other soft tissue techniques (80.9%), Pilates (46.6%), and Yoga (31.5%). The Schroth techniques used by all survey respondents included breathing and pelvic corrections. Seven participants were interviewed, but data saturation was achieved after only four interviews. Thematic analysis revealed four, inter-related broad themes describing the factors that influenced Schroth prescription for AIS: (1) the adolescent as a whole, including physical, emotional and mental characteristics, and patient goals, (2) family, including parent relationship with the adolescent and the motivation of parents in regard to Schroth, (3) the systems within which the treatment was being offered, such as vicinity to the clinic and the presence of financial insurance support, and (4) therapist characteristics, such as their training and experience. (4) Conclusions: Schroth therapists worldwide use a variety of adjunctive methods to treat AIS. Therapists prescribing Schroth exercises to AIS consider the complex interplay of intra-, inter- and extra-personal factors in clinical practice. These considerations move beyond the three components of evidence-based practice of research, patient preferences, and clinical expertise, towards a systems-based reflection on exercise prescription.",2023,Sep,J Clin Med,12,18,,,10.3390/jcm12186063,37763003,#872,Marchese 2023,,,0
Selecting Optimal First-Line Treatment for Microsatellite Stable and Non-Mutated RAS/BRAF Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.,Emiloju OE; Zhu M; Xie H; Jin Z; Sinicrope FA; Hubbard JM,"Standard frontline treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is cytotoxic chemotherapy plus a biologic agent such as an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (cetuximab or panitumumab) or anti-VEGF antibody (bevacizumab). Predictive biomarkers include mismatch repair (MMR) status, and RAS and BRAF mutation status; and important factors in treatment selection include primary tumor location, intent of therapy, and potential toxicity, as well as patient age, comorbidities, and patient preference. To date, single-, double-, or triple-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy all have important roles in appropriately selected patients, with the addition of anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR antibody therapy based on the relevant predictive biomarker. Data indicate that patients with proficient MMR, RAS/BRAF wt mCRC are candidates for an anti-EGFR antibody plus doublet chemotherapy if they have a left-sided primary tumor, or for anti-VEGF (bevacizumab) plus doublet or triplet chemotherapy if they have a right-sided primary tumor. Future studies may provide more predictive biomarkers to further personalize therapy for this heterogeneous disease.",2023,Dec,Curr Treat Options Oncol,24,12,1739-1757,,10.1007/s11864-023-01142-8,37966682,#602,Emiloju 2023,,,0
Comparing preference for and use of medication abortion in Texas after policy changes in 2014 and 2018.,Baum SE; Sierra G; Grossman D; Vizcarra E; Potter JE; White K,"OBJECTIVES: Assess preferences for and use of medication abortion in Texas after implementation of two policy changes: a 2013 state law restricting medication abortion and the FDA label change for mifepristone in 2016 nullifying some of this restriction. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed surveys conducted in 2014 and 2018 with abortion patients at 10 Texas abortion facilities. We calculated the percentage of all respondents with an initial preference for medication abortion by survey year, and the type of abortion obtained or planned to obtain among those who were at <10 weeks of gestation. We used multivariable-adjusted mixed-effects Poisson regression models to assess factors associated with medication abortion preference and actual/planned use. RESULTS: Overall, 156 (41%) of 376 respondents in 2014 and 247 (55%) of 448 respondents in 2018 reported initial preference for medication abortion (Prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.28; 95% CI 1.03-1.59). Among those who were <10 weeks of gestation and initially preferred medication abortion, 39 of 124 (31%) obtained or were planning to obtain the method in 2014, compared with 188 of 223 (84%) in 2018 (PR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.69-4.15). After multivariable adjustment, respondents who initially preferred medication abortion and were 7 to 9 weeks of gestation at the time of their ultrasonography (vs <7 weeks) were less likely to obtain or plan to obtain the method (PR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57-0.84). CONCLUSIONS: Abortion patients were more likely to prefer and obtain or plan to obtain their preferred medication abortion after legal restrictions in Texas were nullified. IMPLICATIONS: State policies can affect people's ability to obtain their preferred abortion method. Efforts to provide both abortion options whenever possible, and inform people where each can be obtained, remains an important component of person-centered care despite increasing state abortion restrictions and bans following the reversal of Roe v Wade.",2023,Mar,Contraception,119,,109912,,10.1016/j.contraception.2022.11.003,36473511,#1471,Baum 2023,,,0
Advance Directives.,House SA; Schoo C; Ogilvie WA,"Advance directives are legal documents that outline an individual's preferences regarding major medical decisions. These directives specify the healthcare options that an individual desires or rejects, currently and in the future. In addition, advance directives designate one or more individuals who will act as spokespersons on behalf of the patient if they become unable to communicate their preferences. There are variations in advance directive laws from state to state. Several states have implemented specific forms of advance directives, such as Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST), Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST), Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment (MOST), Physician Orders for Scope of Treatment (POST), Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) Order/Clinician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (COLST), Transportable Physician Orders for Patient Preferences (TPOPP), or similar directives have been introduced. These forms condense the essential elements of an advance directive into a medical order format. To maintain brevity, the term ""POLST"" will be applied to encompass all the variations above in the remainder of this article.",2024,Jan,,,,,,,29083680,#547,House 2024,,,0
Sequencing and combination of current small-molecule inhibitors for chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Where is the evidence?,Chung C; Umoru G; Abboud K; Hobaugh E,"Small-molecule inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a landscape once dominated by chemoimmunotherapy (i.e., an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody in combination with systemic chemotherapy) in fit and unfit individuals. Key challenges include the management of refractory disease as well as the optimization of the therapy sequence. Decreased responsiveness has been observed with prolonged treatment, especially with Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors which are given continuously, while venetoclax, an agent that targets dysregulations in intrinsic apoptosis signaling, has a fixed duration when combined with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or BTK inhibitors. Combination therapy aims to synergistically target different oncogenic signaling pathways to abrogate the proliferation of resistant clones and thereby allows for fixed-duration treatments. An advantage of fixed-duration therapy is the potential to decrease financial and drug-induced toxicities. Sequencing of therapies is important to individualize treatment decisions based on factors such as age, comorbidities, tolerability, and patient preferences. However, to date, there are limited data to guide the rational sequencing or combination of these therapies, since conventional chemoimmunotherapy or chemotherapy regimens were used as comparators against these small-molecule inhibitors in trials that led to their regulatory approvals. In this article, we examined and evaluated the current evidence for sequencing versus the combination of small-molecule inhibitors for CLL by conducting comprehensive searches of the United States National Library of Medicine PubMed database, key meeting abstracts, and clinical practice guidelines. We also summarized findings from expert opinions to elucidate best practices for clinical scenarios with limited evidence to guide treatment selection.",2023,Jul,Eur J Haematol,111,1,15-28,,10.1111/ejh.13973,37037657,#1123,Chung 2023,,,0

Quantifying the association of individual-level characteristics with disparities in kidney transplant waitlist addition among people with HIV.,Shelton BA; Sen B; Becker DJ; MacLennan PA; Budhwani H; Locke JE,"BACKGROUND: Over 45% of people with HIV (PWH) in the United States at least 50 years old and are at heightened risk of aging-related comorbidities including end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), for which kidney transplant is the optimal treatment. Among ESKD patients, PWH have lower likelihood of waitlisting, a requisite step in the transplant process, than individuals without HIV. It is unknown what proportion of the inequity by HIV status can be explained by demographics, medical characteristics, substance use history, and geography. METHODS: The United States Renal Data System, a national database of all individuals ESKD, was used to create a cohort of people with and without HIV through Medicare claims linkage (2007-2017). The primary outcome was waitlisting. Inverse odds ratio weighting was conducted to assess what proportion of the disparity by HIV status could be explained by individual characteristics. RESULTS: Six thousand two hundred and fifty PWH were significantly younger at ESKD diagnosis and more commonly Black with fewer comorbidities. PWH were more frequently characterized as using tobacco, alcohol and drugs. Positive HIV-status was associated with 57% lower likelihood of waitlisting [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46-0.48, P  < 0.001]. Controlling for demographics, medical characteristics, substance use and geography explained 39.8% of this observed disparity (aHR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.59-0.79, P  < 0.001). CONCLUSION: PWH were significantly less likely to be waitlisted, and 60.2% of that disparity remained unexplained.

Using Patient Preferences in Health Technology Assessment: Evaluating Quality-Adjusted Survival Equivalents (QASE) for the Quantification of Non-health Benefits.,Marsh K; Collacott H; Thomson J; Mauer J; Watt S; Shah K; Hauber B; Garrison L; Dzingina M,"Interest in using patient preference (PP) data alongside traditional economic models in health technology assessment (HTA) is growing, including using PP data to quantify non-health benefits. However, this is limited by a lack of standardised methods. In this article, we describe a method for using discrete choice experiment (DCE) data to estimate the value of non-health benefits in terms of quality-adjusted survival equivalence (QASE), which is consistent with the concept of value prevalent among HTA agencies. We describe how PP data can be used to estimate QASE, assess the ability to test the face-validity of QASE estimates of changes in mode of administration calculated from five published DCE oncology studies and review the methodological and normative considerations associated with using QASE to support HTA. We conclude that QASE may have some methodological advantages over alternative methods, but this requires DCEs to estimate second-order effects between length and quality of life. In addition, empirical work has yet to be undertaken to substantiate this advantage and demonstrate the validity of QASE. Further work is also required to align QASE with normative objectives of HTA agencies. Estimating QASE would also have implications for the conduct of DCEs, including standardising and defining more clear attribute definitions.",2024,Feb,Patient,,,,,10.1007/s40271-024-00676-9,38421583,#328,Marsh 2024,,,1
Extended-release Buprenorphine Administered at Discharge in Hospitalized Persons With Opioid Use Disorder: A Case Series.,Hansen ER; South AM; Lofwall MR; Fanucchi LC,"INTRODUCTION: Monthly subcutaneous injectable buprenorphine (XR-Bup) is an option for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) that addresses some sublingual buprenorphine adherence barriers and is infrequently offered to hospitalized patients with OUD. METHODS: A retrospective case series was performed for patients receiving XR-Bup upon discharge from 1 academic medical center. Demographic information, diagnoses, follow-up, and documented factors informing the selection of XR-Bup were extracted from the electronic health record. RESULTS: In 1 year, 37 hospitalized patients with OUD received XR-Bup at discharge. The average age was 37.6 years, and patients were primarily Medicaid insured with an injection-related infection. The most common documented factors informing the selection of XR-Bup were as follows: previous sublingual buprenorphine adherence barriers, concurrent stimulant use disorder, and patient preference. Sixty-four percent of patients scheduled for follow-up attended appointments, and 55% received a second dose of XR-Bup. CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous injectable buprenorphine is an option for OUD treatment among hospitalized patients providing 30 or more days of buprenorphine coverage in the postdischarge period.",2024,Jan-Feb,J Addict Med,18,1,65-67,,10.1097/ADM.0000000000001239,37874645,#521,Hansen 2024,,,0
Minimizing Costs for Dorsal Wrist Ganglion Treatment: A Cost-Minimization Analysis.,Federer AE; Yoo M; Stephens AS; Nelson RE; Steadman JN; Tyser AR; Kazmers NH,"PURPOSE: Dorsal wrist ganglions are treated commonly with aspiration, or open or arthroscopic excision in operating room (OR) or procedure room (PR) settings. As it remains unclear which treatment strategy is most cost-effective in yielding cyst resolution, our purpose was to perform a formal cost-minimization analysis from the societal perspective in this context. METHODS: A microsimulation decision analytic model evaluating 5 treatment strategies for dorsal wrist ganglions was developed, ending in either resolution or a single failed open revision surgical excision. Strategies included immediate open excision in the OR, immediate open excision in the PR, immediate arthroscopic excision in the OR, or 1 or 2 aspirations before each of the surgical options. Recurrence and complications rates were pooled from the literature for each treatment type. One-way sensitivity and threshold analyses were performed. RESULTS: The most cost-minimal strategy was 2 aspiration attempts before open surgical excision in the PR setting ($1,603 ± 1,595 per resolved case), followed by 2 aspirations before open excision in the OR ($1,969 ± 2,165 per resolved case). Immediate arthroscopic excision was the costliest strategy ($6,539 ± 264 per resolved case). Single aspiration preoperatively was more cost-minimal than any form of immediate surgery ($2,918 ± 306 and $4,188 ± 306 per resolved case performed in the PR and OR, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: From the societal perspective, performing 2 aspirations before surgical excision in the PR setting was the most cost-minimal treatment strategy, although in reference to surgeons who do not perform this procedure in the PR setting, open excision in the OR was nearly as cost-effective. As patient preferences may preclude routinely performing 2 aspirations, performing at least 1 aspiration before surgical excision improves the cost-effectiveness of dorsal wrist ganglions treatment.

Co-design of an intervention to improve patient participation in discharge medication communication.,Tobiano G; Latimer S; Manias E; Marshall AP; Rattray M; Jenkinson K; Teasdale T; Wren K; Chaboyer W,"Patients can experience medication-related harm and hospital readmission because they do not understand or adhere to post-hospital medication instructions. Increasing patient medication literacy and, in turn, participation in medication conversations could be a solution. The purposes of this study were to co-design and test an intervention to enhance patient participation in hospital discharge medication communication. In terms of methods, co-design, a collaborative approach where stakeholders design solutions to problems, was used to develop a prototype medication communication intervention. First, our consumer and healthcare professional stakeholders generated intervention ideas. Next, inpatients, opinion leaders, and academic researchers collaborated to determine the most pertinent and feasible intervention ideas. Finally, the prototype intervention was shown to six intended end-users (i.e. hospital patients) who underwent usability interviews and completed the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability questionnaire. The final intervention comprised of a suite of three websites: (i) a medication search engine; (ii) resources to help patients manage their medications once home; and (iii) a question builder tool. The intervention has been tested with intended end-users and results of the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability questionnaire have shown that the intervention is acceptable. Identified usability issues have been addressed. In conclusion, this co-designed intervention provides patients with trustworthy resources that can help them to understand medication information and ask medication-related questions, thus promoting medication literacy and patient participation. In turn, this intervention could enhance patients' medication self-efficacy and healthcare utilization. Using a co-design approach ensured authentic consumer and other stakeholder engagement, while allowing opinion leaders and researchers to ensure that a feasible intervention was developed.",2024,Mar,Int J Qual Health Care,36,1,,,10.1093/intqhc/mzae013,38492231,#233,Tobiano 2024,,,0
Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: What do the current USPSTF guidelines say?,Mallick S; Shroff GR; Linzer M,"The 2022 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation notes that the decision to initiate daily aspirin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) should be made on a case-by-case basis for adults ages 40 to 59 with a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk. The recommendation applies to those without signs or symptoms of clinically evident CVD who are not at an increased risk of bleeding.

METHOD: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted with multidisciplinary HCP from 12 geriatric wards in the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority. RESULTS: Of the 289 HCPs responding (response rate 61%), mean age 37.8 years (SD 11.3), 235 (81.3%) women, 12.4 (SD 9.6) years of experience and 67 (23.2%) medical doctors, only half report clarifying patients' preferences. The majority reported that they did not inform, involve and treat in line with such preferences. However, 53% believe that HCP, patients and next-of-kin should make clinical decisions together. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate a lack of engagement in conversation and inclusion of patient preferences when providing health interventions in geriatric wards.

Termination counseling among US perinatal genetic counselors in the setting of second trimester fetal anomalies.,Rankin HA; Voegtline K; Olson S; Sufrin C,"Many pregnant people learn of fetal anomalies in the second trimester and subsequently present to prenatal genetic counselors (PGCs) for counseling, including but not limited to a nuanced discussion about whether to continue or terminate pregnancy. In those who choose to terminate, the decision between dilation and evacuation (D&E) or induction is often one of patient preference and as such, is heavily influenced by the quality of counseling received. PGCs are expertly trained to provide values-based counseling, yet little is known about their termination counseling practices, referral practice patterns, and perceived responsibilities in caring for this group of pregnant people. To gain this knowledge, we surveyed a national sample of PGCs in early 2022 and received 70 completed responses. The survey contained open- and closed-ended questions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and free response data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Eighty percent (n = 56) of respondents reported that <50% of their patients had previously received termination options counseling. Most strikingly, 15% of respondents provided termination counseling that was beyond their self-identified comfort level. Scenario-based questions assessed respondents' counseling practice patterns in seven real-world situations, presented in order of decreasing severity for the fetus. Respondents were 50% less likely to provide termination options counseling to patients between the most lethal to the least lethal proposed fetal anomaly. The scenario-based analysis revealed two distinct termination counseling approaches: (1) all options counseling with an explicit discussion of options to continue or terminate and (2) discretionary options counseling focused on identifying patient preferences to guide counseling and not explicitly stating all available options. This study highlights the need to ensure PGCs feel well-trained to discuss the general features of second trimester pregnancy termination and, if unable to do so, to practice in systems with timely referral to providers well-versed in the counseling about all methods of termination.",2024,Feb,J Genet Couns,,,,,10.1002/jgc4.1888,38425099,#327,Rankin 2024,,,0

Public Preferences for Introducing a COVID-19 Certificate: A Discrete Choice Experiment in the Netherlands.,Veldwijk J; van Exel J; de Bekker-Grob EW; Mouter N,"OBJECTIVE: Here we investigate public preferences for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) certificates in the Netherlands, and whether these preferences differ between subgroups in the population. METHODS: A survey including a discrete choice experiment was administered to 1500 members of the adult population of the Netherlands. Each participant was asked to choose between hypothetical COVID-19 certificates that differed in seven attributes: the starting date, and whether the certificate allowed gathering with multiple people, shopping without appointment, visiting bars and restaurants, visiting cinemas and theatres, attending events, and practising indoor sports. Latent class models (LCMs) were used to determine the attribute relative importance and predicted acceptance rate of hypothetical certificates. RESULTS: Three classes of preference patterns were identified in the LCM. One class a priori opposed a certificate (only two attributes influencing preferences), another class was relatively neutral and included all attributes in their decision making, and the final class was positive towards a certificate. Respondents aged > 65 years and those who plan to get vaccinated were more likely to belong to the latter two classes. Being allowed to shop without appointment and to visit bars and restaurants was most important to all respondents, increasing predicted acceptance rate by 12 percentage points. CONCLUSIONS: Preferences for introduction of a COVID-19 certificate are mixed. A certificate that allows for shopping without appointment and visiting bars and restaurants is likely to increase acceptance. The support of younger citizens and those who plan to get vaccinated seems most sensitive to the specific freedoms granted by a COVID-19 certificate.",2023,Jul,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,21,4,603-614,,10.1007/s40258-023-00808-6,37155007,#1113,Veldwijk 2023,,,1
Validation of the Korean Version of Patient-Centered Care Tool: For Outpatients.,Kim YJ; Lee G; Choi S,"AIM: The objective of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of the Korean version of the patient-centered care (K-PCC) instrument for outpatients. The study was conducted due to the absence of a measurement tool specifically designed to evaluate patient-centered care for outpatients. DESIGN: This study is a methodological study to verify the validity and reliability of the Korean version of Patient-Centered Care (K-PCC) to measure patient-centeredness for outpatients. METHODS: As a first step for the evaluation of the tool, the content validity was verified by expert panel. Then, a total of 400 outpatients were recruited, and construct validity was verified through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) as the second step for the evaluation of the tool. The convergent and discriminant validity of the tool was verified by calculating the standardized factor loads, construct reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE), and calculating the correlation square between the factors as the third and fourth steps for the evaluation of the tool. And as a fifth step for the evaluation of the tool, criterion validity was evaluated by comparing the correlation with the patient-centeredness measurement tool for inpatients (PEx-inpatient). In estimating reliability, internal consistency reliability coefficients were calculated. RESULTS: The confirmatory factor analysis supported good fit for the Korean patient-centered care instrument (K-PCC), and the eight-factor structure was validated. The scale comprises 21 items across eight factors: patient preferences (4 items), physical comfort (2 items), coordination of care (2 items), continuity and transition (3 items), emotional support (2 items), access to medical care (3 items), information and education (2 items), and family and friends (3 items).

Eliciting preferences in glaucoma management-a systematic review of stated-preference studies.,Scheres LMJ; Hiligsmann M; van Gorcom L; Essers BAB; Beckers HJM,"BACKGROUND: In most cases, glaucoma patients require long-term medical and/or surgical treatment. Preference studies investigate how different aspects of glaucoma management, such as health or process outcomes, are valued and herewith help stakeholders make care more responsive to patients' needs. As, to our knowledge, no overview of these studies is currently available, this study aims to systematically review and critically appraise these studies. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using keywords for stated-preference studies and glaucoma up to October 2021. Studies were included if they were original research and used a stated-preference methodology to investigate preferences in patients or healthcare professionals for different aspects of glaucoma management. Data were extracted and summarized. Furthermore, a quality appraisal of the included studies was performed using two validated checklists. RESULTS: The search yielded 1214 articles after removal of duplicates. Of those, 11 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Studies aimed to elicit preferences for glaucoma treatment (27%), glaucoma related health state valuation (36%), and services (36%) from the patient (91%) or ophthalmologists' perspective (9%). Altogether studies included 69 attributes. The majority of attributes were outcome related (62%), followed by process (32%) and cost attributes (6%). Outcome attributes (e.g., effectiveness) were most often of highest importance to the population. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides an up-to-date and critical review of stated-preference studies in the field of glaucoma, suggesting that patients have preferences and are willing to trade-off between characteristics, and revealed that outcome attributes are the most influential characteristics of glaucoma management.",2023,Oct,Eye (Lond),37,15,3137-3144,,10.1038/s41433-023-02482-3,36944711,#843,ScheresLMJ 2023,,,1

We updated our 2021 Expert Review and Position Statement, focusing on recent advances in the diagnosis and management of patients with AsxCS. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed up to August 1, 2023, using PubMed/PubMed Central, EMBASE and Scopus. The following keywords were used in various combinations: ""asymptomatic carotid stenosis,"" ""carotid endarterectomy"" (CEA), ""carotid artery stenting"" (CAS), and ""transcarotid artery revascularization"" (TCAR). Areas covered included (i) improvements in best medical treatment (BMT) for patients with AsxCS and declining stroke risk, (ii) technological advances in surgical/endovascular skills/techniques and outcomes, (iii) risk factors, clinical/imaging characteristics and risk prediction models for the identification of high-risk AsxCS patient subgroups, and (iv) the association between cognitive dysfunction and AsxCS. RESULTS: BMT is essential for all patients with AsxCS, regardless of whether they will eventually be offered CEA, CAS, or TCAR. Specific patient subgroups at high risk for stroke despite BMT should be considered for a carotid revascularization procedure. These patients include those with severe (≥80%) AsxCS, transcranial Doppler-detected microemboli, plaque echolucency on Duplex ultrasound examination, silent infarcts on brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography scans, decreased cerebrovascular reserve, increased size of juxtaluminal hypoechoic area, AsxCS progression, carotid plaque ulceration, and intraplaque hemorrhage. Treatment of patients with AsxCS should be individualized, taking into consideration individual patient preferences and needs, clinical and imaging characteristics, and cultural, ethnic, and social factors. Solid evidence supporting or refuting an association between AsxCS and cognitive dysfunction is lacking. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal management of patients with AsxCS should include BMT for all individuals and a prophylactic carotid revascularization procedure (CEA, CAS, or TCAR) for some asymptomatic patient subgroups, additionally taking into consideration individual patient needs and preference, clinical and imaging characteristics, social and cultural factors, and the available stroke risk prediction models. Future studies should investigate the association between AsxCS with cognitive function and the role of carotid revascularization procedures in the progression or reversal of cognitive dysfunction.",2024,Mar,J Vasc Surg,79,3,695-703,,10.1016/j.jvs.2023.11.004,37939746,#312,Paraskevas 2024,,,0
Barriers to the use of clinical practice guidelines: a qualitative study of Danish physiotherapists and chiropractors.,Hubeishy MH; Rolving N; Poulsen AG; Jensen TS; Rossen CB,"PURPOSE: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Providing evidence-based practice (EBP) for patients with LBP is more cost-effective compared with non-EBP. To help health care professionals provide EBP, several clinical practice guidelines have been published. However, a relatively poor uptake of the guidelines has been identified across various countries. To enhance future implementation of EBP, the aim of this study was to explore barriers to using LBP guidelines in clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative constructivist grounded theory design was employed in order to gain an in-depth understanding of the barriers. Semi-structured interviews (+/- observations) of nine physiotherapists and nine chiropractors from primary care in the Central Denmark Region were conducted. RESULTS: Two key barriers were found to using guidelines in practice: (1) a scepticism due to doubts about validity and applicability of the guidelines, which emerged particularly among physiotherapists; and (2) a deep biomechanical professional identity, due to perceived role, interest, lack of skills, and patient preferences, which emerged particularly among chiropractors. CONCLUSIONS: For guidelines to be better implemented in practice, these key barriers must be addressed in a tailored strategy. Furthermore, this study showed a difference in barriers between the two professions.",2024,Jan,Disabil Rehabil,46,1,105-114,,10.1080/09638288.2022.2157501,36537245,#538,Hubeishy 2024,,,0
Assessment of women's treatment preferences for vasomotor symptoms due to menopause.,Shiozawa A; Thurston RC; Cook E; Yang H; King DD; Kristy RM; Mancuso S,"BACKGROUND: Several therapies for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) due to menopause are available. Treatment preferences and willingness-to-pay for VMS treatment among US women with VMS were evaluated. METHODS: An online survey of women with perimenopausal or postmenopausal VMS was conducted (3/15/21-4/23/21). A discrete choice experiment quantified the impact of 7 treatment attributes on VMS treatment choice: VMS frequency/severity reduction, sleep improvement, risk of breast cancer/cardiovascular events in 6 years, risk of short-term side effects, and out-of-pocket costs. Preference weights (PWs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated and reported. RESULTS: Among 467 women, 86.5% and 87.8% reported moderate to very severe VMS and sleep problems during the preceding month, respectively. Sleep improvement (PW: 0.843; 95% CI: 0.721, 0.965) and reduction in VMS frequency (PW: 0.658; 95% CI: 0.520, 0.796) and severity (PW: 0.628; 95% CI: 0.500, 0.756) most influenced treatment preference; risk of cardiovascular events (PW: 0.150; 95% CI: 0.069, 0.232) or breast cancer (PW: 0.401; 95% CI: 0.306, 0.496) in 6 years had lesser effect.

The move towards living systematic reviews and living guidelines in healthcare: consideration of the possibilities and challenges for living qualitative evidence syntheses.,Carmona C; Carroll C; Baxter S,"Over the past decade qualitative evidence synthesis (QES), a range of methods for synthesising qualitative research evidence, has become a valued form of evidence for guideline producers who wish to understand more about patient preference and acceptability of treatments. The surge in interest in living systematic reviews and the appearance of living guidelines as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic potentially weaken the value and usability of QES.There are currently no published methods for producing living QES, and if QES are to remain of worth to guideline producers then methods for the rapid, frequent updating of them will need to be developed.

Enhancing Patient Choice: Using Self-administered Intranasal Naloxone for Novel Rapid Buprenorphine Initiation.,Randall A; Hull I; Martin SA,"Buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) is a lifesaving treatment for opioid use disorder. The increasing use of illicitly manufactured fentanyl, however, has made initiating BUP-NX more likely to precipitate withdrawal-an experience that deters treatment and causes return to use. If BUP-NX cannot be successfully started, it cannot work. We describe the case of a patient who was able to transition to a therapeutic dose of BUP-NX less than 3 hours after his last illicitly manufactured fentanyl use by choosing to self-administer intranasal naloxone. After the naloxone, the transition took 31 minutes, including 14 minutes of expected moderately severe withdrawal.

"POLST recall, concordance, and decision quality outcomes among nursing home residents and surrogate decision-makers.",Hickman SE; Sudore RL; Torke AM; Tang Q; Bakoyannis G; Heim Smith N; Myers AL; Hammes BJ,"BACKGROUND: POLST orders are actionable in an emergency, so it is important that the decisions be of high quality and concordant with current preferences. The goal of this study is to determine the relationship between concordance and decision quality outcomes, including decision satisfaction and decisional conflict, among nursing facility residents and surrogates who recall POLST. METHODS: We completed structured interviews in 29 nursing facilities with 275 participants who had previously signed a POLST form. This included residents who were still making their own medical decisions (n = 123) and surrogate decision-makers for residents without decisional capacity (n = 152). POLST recall was defined as remembering talking about and/or completing the POLST form previously signed by the participant. Concordance was determined by comparing preferences elicited during a standardized interview with the POLST form on file. Decisional conflict, decision satisfaction, and conversation quality were assessed with standardized tools. RESULTS: Half of participants (50%) remembered talking about or completing the POLST form, but recall was not associated with the length of time since POLST completion or concordance with existing preferences. In multivariable analyses, there was no association between POLST recall, concordance, and decision quality outcomes, though satisfaction was associated with conversation quality. CONCLUSIONS: Half of the residents and surrogates in this study recalled the POLST they previously signed. Neither the age of the form nor the ability to recall the POLST conversation should be considered indicators of whether existing POLST orders match current preferences. Findings confirm a relationship between POLST conversation quality and satisfaction, underscoring the importance of POLST completion as a communication process.",2023,Jul,J Am Geriatr Soc,71,7,2271-2278,,10.1111/jgs.18330,36929327,#1130,Hickman 2023,,,0
Nonpharmacologic and Pharmacologic Treatments of Adult Patients With Major Depressive Disorder: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis for a Clinical Guideline by the American College of Physicians.,Gartlehner G; Dobrescu A; Chapman A; Toromanova A; Emprechtinger R; Persad E; Affengruber L; Pieh C; Klerings I; Wagner G,"BACKGROUND: Primary care patients and clinicians may prefer alternative options to second-generation antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD). PURPOSE: To compare the benefits and harms of nonpharmacologic treatments with second-generation antidepressants as first-step interventions for acute MDD, and to compare second-step treatment strategies for patients who did not achieve remission after an initial attempt with antidepressants. DATA SOURCES: English-language studies from several electronic databases from 1 January 1990 to 8 August 2022, trial registries, gray literature databases, and reference lists to identify unpublished research. STUDY SELECTION: 2 investigators independently selected randomized trials of at least 6 weeks' duration. DATA EXTRACTION: Reviewers abstracted data about study design and conduct, participants, interventions, and outcomes. They dually rated the risk of bias of studies and the certainty of evidence for outcomes of interest. DATA SYNTHESIS: 65 randomized trials met the inclusion criteria; eligible data from nonrandomized studies were not found. Meta-analyses and network meta-analyses indicated similar benefits of most nonpharmacologic treatments and antidepressants as first-step treatments. Antidepressants had higher risks for discontinuation because of adverse events than most other treatments. For second-step therapies, different switching and augmentation strategies provided similar symptomatic relief. The certainty of evidence for most comparisons is low; findings should be interpreted cautiously. LIMITATIONS: Many studies had methodological limitations or dosing inequalities; publication bias might have affected some comparisons. In some cases, conclusions could not be drawn because of insufficient evidence. CONCLUSION: Although benefits seem to be similar among first- and second-step MDD treatments, the certainty of evidence is low for most comparisons. Clinicians and patients should focus on options with the most reliable evidence and take adverse event profiles and patient preferences into consideration.
