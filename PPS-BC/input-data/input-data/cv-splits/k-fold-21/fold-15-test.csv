In the eyes of the beholders: Subjective experiences of positive symptoms among patients with symptoms of psychosis seeking psychotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Reduction of positive symptoms is often the focus of psychiatric treatment for patients with psychosis; however, it is becoming increasingly clear that some patients experience ambivalence towards positive symptoms or may even experience them as pleasant. The present study extends upon work from online studies of patients without verified diagnoses. The first aim was to examine the frequency with which patients report negative, neutral or even positive appraisals of positive symptoms. A second aim was to identify whether these appraisals were associated with medication adherence. METHODS: One-hundred twelve treatment-seeking patients with current symptoms of psychosis completed the Subjective Perception of Positive Symptoms-Revised (SUPPOSY-R), a scale assessing appraisals of positive symptoms (e.g., gain from illness, impact on daily life), as well as questions regarding medication adherence. RESULTS: Although most patients reported experiencing positive symptoms as predominantly unpleasant, appraisals differed between symptom clusters and up to 54.4 % reported that they would miss at least some aspects of positive symptoms should they disappear. Patients particularly welcomed the disappearance of auditory hallucinations (71.2 %). Symptom appraisal was not significantly associated with medication compliance (p > .17); however, more patients with low medication adherence reported they would feel at least some regret if their symptoms were to completely disappear (48.9 %, n = 23) versus patients with high adherence (41.7 %, n = 20). DISCUSSION: Ambivalent or positive appraisals of positive symptoms are lower among treatment-seeking patients compared to patients recruited for online studies, who may not be actively seeking treatment. Auditory hallucinations may cause most distress among treatment-seeking patients. A collaborative approach including assessment of possible positive appraisals of symptoms is important when identifying treatment goals.",0
Telemedicine for Neurosurgery Consultations at a Pituitary Center of Excellence: Patient Preference and Willingness to Proceed with Surgery.,"Objective  The purpose of this study was to evaluate pituitary tumor patient satisfaction with telemedicine, patient preference for telemedicine, potential socioeconomic benefit of telemedicine, and patients' willingness to proceed with surgery based on a telemedicine visit alone. Method  In total, 134 patients who had pituitary surgery and a telemedicine visit during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (April 23, 2020-March 4, 2021) were called to participate in a 13-part questionnaire. Chi-square, ANOVA, and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were used to determine significance. Result  Of 134 patients contacted, 90 responded (67%). Ninety-five percent were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with their telemedicine visit, with 62% stating their visit was ""the same"" or ""better"" than previous in-person appointments. Eighty-two percent of the patients rated their telemedicine visit as ""easy"" or ""very easy."" On average, patients saved 150 minutes by using telemedicine compared with patient reported in-person visit times. Seventy-seven percent of patients reported the need to take off from work for in-person visits, compared with just 12% when using telemedicine. Forty-nine percent of patients preferred in-person visits, 34% preferred telemedicine, and 17% had no preference. Fifty percent of patients said they would feel comfortable proceeding with surgery based on a telemedicine visit alone. Patients with both initial evaluation and follow-up conducted via telemedicine were more likely to feel comfortable proceeding with surgery based on a telemedicine visit alone compared with patients who had only follow-up telemedicine visits ( p  = 0.051). Conclusion  Many patients are satisfied with telemedicine visits and feel comfortable proceeding with surgery based on a telemedicine visit alone. Telemedicine is an important adjunct to increase access to care at a Pituitary Center of Excellence.",0
"Introduction of the L-PAP Flap: Bipedicled, Conjoined, and Stacked Thigh-Based Flaps for Autologous Breast Reconstruction.","SUMMARY: Thigh-based flaps are increasingly popular options for autologous breast reconstruction in the setting of abdominal donor-site inadequacy, previous surgery, or patient preference, but the volume and skin associated with these flaps are often lacking relative to the abdomen. An individualized, shared decision-making approach to donor-site selection was adopted based on body shape, surgical history, lifestyle, reconstructive needs, and patient expectations. Different thigh-based flaps combined in stacked, bipedicled, or conjoined configurations were selected to maximize efficient use of available soft-tissue skin and volume while optimizing donor-site aesthetics. A total of 23 thigh-based stacked, bipedicled, or conjoined profunda artery perforator (PAP), lateral thigh perforator (LTP), or gracilis musculocutaneous flap components were used in six patients. Configurations included bilateral stacked PAP and LTP flaps, bipedicled posterolateral thigh flaps based on the LTP and PAP (L-PAP), and bipedicled thigh flaps based on the gracilis and PAP pedicles. Most anastomoses were performed to the antegrade and retrograde internal mammary vessels; intraflap anastomoses were performed in one case. There were no partial or total flap losses. There was one donor-site seroma. Design of stacked, bipedicled, and conjoined thigh-based flaps using multiple conventional flap components allows for tailored approaches to donor-site utilization based on individual body shape in selected patients. Bipedicled design with the L-PAP flap represents one strategy in appropriate cases to overcome skin and volume deficiencies while facilitating coning and projection. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.",0
Migraine Patient Care Model Preferences in a Community Practice.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Developing high-value care models with limited resources for large populations of individuals with migraine requires advanced understanding of patient preferences for care delivery methods. In this study, we aimed to inform the development of migraine care models by assessing patient preferences for types of care delivery and determining differences based on migraine frequency and disability. METHODS: We analyzed unpublished data from a cross-sectional survey of 516 randomly selected individuals with migraine within a community practice associated with Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. RESULTS: Individuals with chronic migraine, compared with those with episodic migraine, were more likely to prefer a visit with a neurologist (p = 0.0005), synchronous telephone conference with primary care provider (PCP) and neurologist (p = 0.0102), and a written migraine action plan in the medical record (p = 0.0343). Compared with those with mild/no disability, individuals with moderate-to-severe disability were more likely to prefer a visit with a neurologist (p < 0.0001), synchronous video or telephone conference with PCP and neurologist (p < 0.0001), PCP communication with neurologist (p = 0.0099), electronic message to primary care team with access to neurologist (p = 0.0216), and written action plan in the medical record (p = 0.0011). Collectively, individuals most preferred telephone follow-up and least preferred communications with a nurse or pharmacist or generalized education (all p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: We observed differences in migraine care delivery preferences between migraine frequency and level of migraine disability. Observations support development of care pathways that include a written migraine action plan, primary care-neurology collaboration including nontraditional interactions, and prioritization of traditional neurology consultation for the most disabled patients.",0
Australian Patient Preferences for Discussing Spiritual Issues in the Hospital Setting: An Exploratory Mixed Methods Study.,"While there is high patient acceptance for clinical staff discussing issues regarding spirituality with hospital inpatients, it is not clear which staff member patients prefer for these discussions. This unique exploratory study investigated inpatient preferences regarding which staff member should raise the topic of spirituality. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with inpatients at six hospitals in Sydney, Australia (n = 897), with a subset invited to participate in qualitative interviews (n = 41). Pastoral care staff (32.9%) were the preferred staff members with whom to discuss spiritual issues, followed by doctors (22.4%). Qualitative findings indicated that individual characteristics of the staff member are more important than their role.",0
What types of information do pharmacists include in comprehensive medication management review reports? A qualitative content analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Comprehensive medication management reviews are an established intervention to identify medication-related problems, such as the prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications, and under- and over-prescribing. However, the types of information included in written reports of comprehensive medication management reviews, beyond types of medication-related problems, are unknown. AIM: This study aimed to explore the types of information Australian pharmacists include in their written reports following comprehensive medication management reviews. METHOD: Australian consultant pharmacists were invited to upload their 10 most recent written reports of their domiciliary-based comprehensive medication management reviews. A random selection of the reports, stratified by each pharmacist, were included for qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-two de-identified reports from eight consultant pharmacists located in five of the eight Australian States and Territories were included for analysis. From the evaluated reports, four major categories of information were identified: (1) patient details such as date of interview (n = 72, 100%) and medicine history (n = 70, 97%); (2) pharmacist assessment including assessment of the patient (n = 70, 97%), medicines management (n = 68, 94%) and medicine-related issues (n = 60, 83%); (3) pharmacist recommendations, specifically pharmacological recommendations (n = 67, 93%); and (4) patient-centred experiences such as perspectives on medicines (n = 56, 78%). Reporting of patient-centred experiences appeared most variably in the included reports, including patient concerns (n = 38, 53%), willingness for change (n = 27, 38%), patient preferences (n = 13, 18%), and patient goals (n = 7, 10%). CONCLUSION: Pharmacists within our study included a wide variety of information in their comprehensive medication management review reports. Aside from medication-related problems, pharmacists commonly provided a holistic assessment of the patients they care for. However, variability across reports has the potential to impact consistent service delivery.",0
Non-pharmacological and nonsurgical interventions in male urinary incontinence: A scoping review.,"AIMS: To describe and synthesize non-pharmacological and nonsurgical interventions for male urinary incontinence from the existing literature. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodology suggested by Arksey and O'Malley: (1) identification of the research questions; (2) identification of relevant studies using a three-step search recommended by JBI: an initial search within PubMed and CINAHL, a comprehensive literature search within PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and literature search of references lists; (3) study selection; (4) data extraction and charting; (5) collation, summarization, and reporting of the results. The PRISMA-ScR Checklist was used to report. RESULTS: A total of 4602 studies were identified, of which 87 studies were included. Approximately 78% were randomized controlled trials. More than 88% of the participants were men with prostate cancer. Exercising pelvic floor muscles 30 times per day for 12 weeks was the most frequently reported. Parameters of electrical stimulation were typically set up to 50 Hz and 300 μs for frequency and width of pulse, respectively, and lasted for 15 min. Pure pelvic floor muscle training, Pilates, Yoga, whole body vibration, diaphragm/abdominal muscle training, micturition interruption exercise, acupuncture, and auriculotherapy showed positive effects on reducing urinary incontinence. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested implementing pelvic floor muscle training alone before or after surgery can both prompt the recovery of continence in men after prostate cancer surgery. The decision to use biofeedback or electrical stimulation to enhance the therapeutic effect of pelvic floor muscle training should be approached with caution. More rigorous designed studies are needed to validate the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine techniques and diverse novel methods. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Physicians and nurses need to be up to date on the latest evidence-based non-pharmacological and nonsurgical interventions in male urinary incontinence and select appropriate interventions based on available medical resources and patient preferences.",0
The experience of patients with lung cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic and its importance for post-pandemic outpatient cancer care planning: A cross sectional study exploring the roles of age and frailty.,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the care and experiences of people with cancer, but it presented an opportunity to improve the delivery of outpatient care post-pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an observational cross-sectional study with people with lung cancer throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey investigated patients' experiences and preferences regarding the delivery of cancer care to plan for post-pandemic care, as well as the pandemic's impact on their functional status (physical and psycho-social), exploring the role of age and frailty. RESULTS: Amongst 282 eligible participants, 88%, 86%, and 59% of patients reported feeling appropriately supported during the pandemic by their cancer centre, friends/family, and primary care services, respectively. Remote oncology consultations were delivered to 90% of patients during the pandemic, of which 3% did not meet patients' expectations. Regarding post-pandemic outpatient care preferences, face-to-face appointments were preferred by 93% for the first appointment, by 64% when discussing imaging results, and by 60% for reviews during anti-cancer treatments. Older patients aged 70 years and above were more likely to favour face-to-face appointments (p = 0.007), regardless of their frailty status. Patient preferences changed over time, with the more recent participants preferring remote appointments during anti-cancer treatments (p = 0.0278). Regarding the pandemic's impact, abnormal levels of anxiety and depression were found in 16% and 17% of patients, respectively. Younger patients experienced higher abnormal levels of anxiety and depression (p = 0.036, p = 0.021). Amongst the older sub-group, those with frailty had higher levels of anxiety and depression (p < 0.001). Amongst all participants, 54% reported a considerable negative impact from the pandemic on different aspects of their daily life, particularly emotional and psychological health and sleep patterns, which were more marked in younger patients and the older sub-group with frailty. Older patients without frailty reported the least impact on their functional status. DISCUSSION: There is a need for more personalised outpatient consultation options during cancer care. Whilst there is a preference for face-to-face consultations for older patients, following the pandemic there is a growing acceptance of remote consultations particularly during anti-cancer treatment. Older patients with lung cancer without frailty were less affected by the pandemic than those with frailty and younger patients, requiring less support from healthcare services.",0
Colon Capsule Endoscopy - Shining the Light through the Colon.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) is a non-invasive, wireless capsule endoscope. In this article, we review its current applications, compare its performance with optical colonoscopy (OC) and alternative imaging modalities like CT colonography (CTC), and highlight developments that may increase potential future use. RECENT FINDINGS: By comparison to OC both CCE and CTC have a good sensitivity and specificity in detecting colonic polyps. CCE is more sensitive in detecting sub centimetre polyps. CCE is capable of detecting colonic inflammation and anorectal pathologies, commonly missed by CTC. However, rates of complete CCE examinations are limited by inadequate bowel preparation or incomplete colonic transit, whereas CTC can be performed with less bowel purgatives. Patients tolerate CCE better than OC, however patient preference between CCE and CTC vary. CCE and CTC are both reasonable alternatives to OC. Strategies to improve completion rates and adequacy of bowel preparation will improve cost and clinical effectiveness of CCE.",0
Evaluating the impact of interprofessional training wards on patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes: a mixed-methods analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Interprofessional teamwork is pivotal in modern healthcare, prompting the establishment of interprofessional training wards since 1996. While these wards serve as hubs for optimizing healthcare professional collaboration and communication, research into patient outcomes remains notably sparse and geographically limited, predominantly examining patient satisfaction and sparingly exploring other metrics like mortality or self-discharge rates. This study seeks to bridge this gap, comparing patient outcomes in interprofessional training wards and conventional wards under the hypothesis that the former offers no disadvantage to patient outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We explored patient outcomes within an interprofessional student ward called A-STAR at a University Hospital from October 2019 to December 2022. Engaging with patients discharged between May 2021 and April 2022, we utilized digital and paper-based anonymous questionnaires, catering to patient preference, to gather pertinent data. RESULTS: Analysis of outcomes for 1,482 A-STAR (interprofessional student ward) and 5,752 conventional ward patients revealed noteworthy findings. A-STAR patients tended to be younger (59 vs. 61 years, p < 0.01) and more frequently male (73.5% vs. 70.4%, p = 0.025). Vital clinical outcomes, such as discharges against medical advice, complication-driven readmissions, and ICU transfers, were statistically similar between groups, as were mortality rates (1.2% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.468). A-STAR demonstrated high patient satisfaction, underscored by positive reflections on team competence, ward atmosphere, and responsiveness to concerns, emphasizing the value placed on interprofessional collaboration. Patient narratives commended team kindness, lucid explanations, and proactive involvement. DISCUSSION: This data collectively underscores the safety and reliability of patient care within training wards, affirming that patients can trust the care provided in these settings. Patients on the interprofessional ward demonstrated high satisfaction levels: 96.7% appreciated the atmosphere and conduct of ward rounds. In comparison, 98.3% were satisfied with the discussion and information about their treatment during their hospital stay.",0
Treatment preferences towards thrombopoietin-receptor agonists for immune thrombocytopenia and experience of disease (TRAPeze): Italy cohort.,"OBJECTIVE: Identify patient preference towards thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) and determine the clinical and social impact of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in Italy. METHODS: The Thrombopoietin-Receptor Agonist Patient experience (TRAPeze) survey collected responses from Italian residents from 17th January to 28th February 2022. TRAPeze utilized a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit patient preferences towards TPO-RA attributes and a patient burden survey (PBS) to determine ITP disease characteristics and social impact. RESULTS: Seventy-six respondents completed the DCE, of which 69 completed both the DCE and PBS (mean [range] age 45 [18.0-73.0] years, 80% female). TPO-RA attributes with the greatest influence over respondent choice were method of administration (odds ratio [OR] 2.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.16-4.06), drug-food interactions (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.17-1.86) and frequency of dosing (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.15-1.52). Respondents were more likely to prefer therapies administered orally over subcutaneous injection (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.51-5.63), once weekly over once daily (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.26-2.65), and therapies without food restrictions over with restrictions (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.17-2.14).The most frequently reported symptoms were bruising (82%), petechiae (65%) and fatigue (64%). Most respondents (84%) felt ITP impacted familial relationships and 71% of employed respondents reported fatigue influencing their ability to work, with 31% reducing working hours. CONCLUSION: Although responses indicated a moderate perception of general health, ITP clearly impacted respondent work and social life. Our findings demonstrate respondents preferred TPO-RAs delivered orally, with less frequent dosing and without food restrictions.",1
"Clinical practice guidelines of the Japan Research Committee of the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare for Intractable Vasculitis for the management of microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis: The 2023 update - secondary publica","OBJECTIVE: To revise the 2017 clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) to reflect advancements in the field. METHODS: Similar to the 2017 CPG, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was adopted for this revision. The intended users of this CPG include patients diagnosed with MPA or GPA in Japan and their families and healthcare professionals, including specialists and non-specialists. Based on a scoping review, four clinical questions (CQs) of the 2017 guidelines were modified, and six new CQs were added. RESULTS: We suggest a combination of glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide or rituximab for remission induction therapy. In cases where cyclophosphamide or rituximab is used, we suggest the use of avacopan over high-dose glucocorticoid. Furthermore, we suggest against the use of plasma exchange in addition to the standard treatment in severe cases of MPA/GPA. Finally, we suggest the use of glucocorticoid and rituximab over glucocorticoid and azathioprine for remission maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations have been updated based on patient preference, certainty of evidence, benefit and risk balance, and cost.",0
Sequencing Systemic Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Multiple treatment options are now approved for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-containing regimen should be highly considered as the first-line treatment when there is no contraindication, especially in those with hepatitis virus-related HCC, due to proven superior overall survival (OS) compared to sorafenib. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab remain the treatment of choice among all ICI-containing regimens, unless contraindications to either of the medications exist. Although sorafenib is still the only medication currently approved for select patients with Child-Pugh B (CP) HCC in the first-line setting, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is being studied in this patient population. Moreover, patients with post-liver transplantation recurrence may benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), while more studies are still needed to determine the safety of ICIs in this setting. Interestingly, multiple potential biomarkers, including tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI) status, and PD-L1 expression level, have inconsistently predicted response to ICIs in patients with HCC. Limited evidence is available to guide treatment choice in later-line settings after progressing on ICIs, and decisions should be based on the safety profile of the treatment regimen and patient preference. Multiple trials are ongoing to elucidate the optimal treatment sequence. Of note, we believe that TKIs (e.g., cabozantinib, regorafenib, lenvatinib, and sorafenib) could be more beneficial in later-line settings to broaden inhibition of other pathways apart from vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). When conventional treatment options are exhausted, tissue biopsy may be helpful to reveal rare targetable mutations, such as RET gene fusions.",0
Patient-related outcomes of conventional impression making versus intraoral scanning for prosthetic rehabilitation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Intraoral scanning has been reported to be preferred by patients over conventional impression making. Nevertheless, information regarding patient-related outcomes for conventional impression making and digital scanning is sparse. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze patient-related outcomes of intraoral scanning and conventional impression methods. The primary outcomes evaluated were patient preference and satisfaction, and the secondary outcomes discomfort, nausea, unpleasant taste, breathing difficulty, pain, and anxiety. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual searches were performed for clinical trials that evaluated patient-related outcomes for intraoral scanning and conventional impression making for prosthetic rehabilitation. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa scale were used to assess the quality of the studies. Random-effects models using mean difference were used for meta-analyses. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q test and I(2) statistics (α=.05). RESULTS: The search strategy identified 1626 articles, and 11 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Patients preferred intraoral scanning to conventional impression making. The mean difference for patient preference was 15.02 (95% confidence interval of 8.33 - 21.73; P<.001). Discomfort, absence of nausea, absence of unpleasant taste, and absence of breathing difficulty were also significantly different (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoral scanning is a suitable alternative to conventional impression procedures, promoting less discomfort for patients sensitive to taste, nausea, and breathing difficulty than when conventional impression making techniques are used.",0
Patient preferences and experiences regarding thrombopoietin-receptor agonists for immune thrombocytopenia in The Netherlands (TRAPeze Netherlands study).,"OBJECTIVE: Identify patient experience and preference towards thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) in treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in the Netherlands. METHODS: The Thrombopoietin-Receptor Agonist Patient experience (TRAPeze) survey used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit patient preferences and a patient burden survey (PBS) to evaluate the clinical and social impact of ITP. TRAPeze collected responses from 6th October to 19th November 2021. RESULTS: Seventy-six respondents completed the DCE: treatment preference appeared to be driven by method of administration (odds ratio [OR] 4.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.88-6.52), frequency of dosing (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.86-2.92) and drug-food interactions (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.54-2.37). Respondents preferred therapies delivered orally over subcutaneous injection (OR 4.22; 95% CI 2.76-6.46), dosed once weekly over once daily (OR 2.37; 95% CI 1.58-3.54) and without food restrictions over with restrictions (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.52-2.38). Sixty-nine respondents completed the DCE and PBS (mean [range] age 53 [19-83] years, 65% female). Seven incomplete PBS responses were excluded from analysis. Respondents were currently, or most recently, receiving eltrombopag (n = 43) or romiplostim (n = 26), of which 30% (n = 21/69) had previously received another TPO-RA. Loss (29%, n = 6/21) and lack (29%, n = 6/21) of response were the most common reasons for switching TPO-RA. Only 28% (n = 18/65) of respondents felt their TPO-RA increased energy levels. CONCLUSION: Patients preferred therapies delivered orally, dosed less frequently and without food restrictions. QoL of ITP patients on TPO-RAs can be improved; the burden analyses presented can inform future efforts towards this.",1
Eliciting Depression Patients' Preferences for Medication Management: A Protocol for Discrete Choice Experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Depression threatens people's lives and imposes huge economic burden. Antidepressant therapy is the first-line treatment for depression, and patient adherence to medication is the key to successful treatment. Depression patients have poor medication adherence, which leads to failure of depression management and significantly poorer clinical outcomes. Incorporating patient preferences into clinical decisions can improve uptake rates, optimize treatment adherence. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) can elicit and quantify individual preferences. Previous DCE studies were conducted in developed countries and ignored the influences of factors other than the medication. This paper outlines an ongoing DCE that aims to (1) explore medication-management-related characteristics that may affect depression patients' adherence to antidepressant, (2) elicit how depression patients consider the trade-offs among different medication managements. METHODS: The six attributes and their levels were developed through a literature review, semi-structured interviews and experts and focus group discussions. A fractional factorial design in the software Ngene 1.2 version was used to generate 36 choice sets, and they were divided into 3 blocks. A mixed logit model will be used to explore the patients' preferences, willingness to pay and uptake rate of depression patients for medication management attributes. RESULTS: The final questionnaire consists of three parts. The first is the introduction, which introduces the purpose of the study and the requirements of completing the questionnaire. This was followed by a general information questionnaire, which included sociodemographic characteristics. The last part is DCE tasks, which include 13 DCE choice sets, and each choice set include two alternative and one ""opt-out"" option. The pilot-test results showed the questionnaire was easy to understand and could be used in formal surveys. CONCLUSION: Our study shows how the development process of the study can be conducted and reported systematically and rigorously according to the theoretical foundation and design principles in DCE.",1
[Patient Preferences for Exercise Therapy in People with Severe Mental Illness in Germany].,"PURPOSE: Assessing the experience with and the attitudes towards exercise therapy in persons with severe mental illness (SMI). Furthermore, potential variables of high preference towards exercise therapy are investigated. METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study of SMI patients aged between 18 and 65 years (n=385). Patients were interviewed by trained staff using standardised instruments. Potential variables were analysed using a hierarchic binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: 84,4% of SMI patients had a high preference for exercise therapy; of these, 44,1% exercised regularly. Among patients with severe mental illness especially a higher value in the GAF-assessment (p=0,041) and living in a metropolitan area (p=0,011) predict a high preference for exercise therapy. CONCLUSION: Most of the patients with severe mental illness interviewed in this study place a surprisingly high value on sports and exercise therapy. Due to the increasing evidence with regard to positive effects of these therapies, it may be an excellent starting point to expand sports and exercise therapy as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. At the same time, strategies for everyday transfer need to be implemented more rigorously.",0
"Protocol of the Comparison of Intravesical Therapy and Surgery as Treatment Options (CISTO) study: a pragmatic, prospective multicenter observational cohort study of recurrent high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.","BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer poses a significant public health burden, with high recurrence and progression rates in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Current treatment options include bladder-sparing therapies (BST) and radical cystectomy, both with associated risks and benefits. However, evidence supporting optimal management decisions for patients with recurrent high-grade NMIBC remains limited, leading to uncertainty for patients and clinicians. The CISTO (Comparison of Intravesical Therapy and Surgery as Treatment Options) Study aims to address this critical knowledge gap by comparing outcomes between patients undergoing BST and radical cystectomy. METHODS: The CISTO Study is a pragmatic, prospective observational cohort trial across 36 academic and community urology practices in the US. The study will enroll 572 patients with a diagnosis of recurrent high-grade NMIBC who select management with either BST or radical cystectomy. The primary outcome is health-related quality of life (QOL) at 12 months as measured with the EORTC-QLQ-C30. Secondary outcomes include bladder cancer-specific QOL, progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and financial toxicity. The study will also assess patient preferences for treatment outcomes. Statistical analyses will employ targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) to address treatment selection bias and confounding by indication. DISCUSSION: The CISTO Study is powered to detect clinically important differences in QOL and cancer-specific survival between the two treatment approaches. By including a diverse patient population, the study also aims to assess outcomes across the following patient characteristics: age, gender, race, burden of comorbid health conditions, cancer severity, caregiver status, social determinants of health, and rurality. Treatment outcomes may also vary by patient preferences, health literacy, and baseline QOL. The CISTO Study will fill a crucial evidence gap in the management of recurrent high-grade NMIBC, providing evidence-based guidance for patients and clinicians in choosing between BST and radical cystectomy. The CISTO study will provide an evidence-based approach to identifying the right treatment for the right patient at the right time in the challenging clinical setting of recurrent high-grade NMIBC.

Values Assessment Tools in Advanced Cancer: A Clinical Literature Review.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced cancer may receive cancer treatment that does not reflect their values because they may not be completely aware of what is important to them regarding treatment-related decisions when they are diagnosed. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review was to determine whether existing values assessment tools can improve awareness of treatment-related decisional values in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: PubMed®, CINAHL®, and PsycINFO® databases were searched for original English-language articles evaluating values assessment tools that could be used to assess patients with advanced cancer. The quality of the identified tools was evaluated using selected International Patient Decision Aid Standards instrument, version 3.0, criteria. FINDINGS: All tools identified are appropriate for use in patients with advanced cancer. Two scored at least 80% on the selected International Patient Decision Aid Standards criteria. The Short Graphic Values History Tool was developed with patient and clinician input and may be particularly useful for low-literacy patient populations with advanced cancer. No values assessment tools have been identified specifically for use in patients with advanced cancer.",0
Understanding patient preferences for student clinician attire: a cross-sectional study of a student chiropractic clinic in Australia.,"OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have investigated the role of clinical attire in establishing patient-held perceptions of professionalism and knowledgeability across various healthcare settings. This study aimed to understand patients' preferences for chiropractic student attire. METHODS: Three hundred and twenty patients were recruited from a university chiropractic clinic and asked to complete an online questionnaire. The patients' preferences for five different attires were rated and calculated as the composite score of five domains (knowledgeable, trustworthy, caring, professional, and comfortable). RESULTS: While 71.9% of participants indicated that how students dress was important to them, most (63.4%) disagreed that wearing a white coat was essential for chiropractic student clinicians. The most preferred form of attire was the current clinic shirt. CONCLUSION: The attire worn by chiropractic student clinicians at a single institution was found to be an influential attribute. Student chiropractic clinicians should dress professionally to make a good first impression. This study provided some guidance with the ongoing debate around students' dress code.",0
"Feasibility, Effectiveness and Safety of Elastomeric Pumps for Delivery of Antibiotics to Adult Hospital Inpatients-A Systematic Review.","Elastomeric infusion pumps (EMPs) have been implemented in many fields, including analgesia, chemotherapy and cardiology. Their application in antimicrobials is mainly limited to the outpatient setting, but with a need to optimise inpatient antimicrobial treatment, the use of EMPs presents a potential option. This review aimed to identify if the use of EMPs within an inpatient setting is feasible, effective and safe for antimicrobial use. Criteria for inclusion were human studies that involved the treatment of an infection with intravenous antimicrobial agents via an EMP. A search strategy was developed covering both the indexed and grey literature, with all study designs included. The review found 1 eligible study enrolling 6 patients. There was strong patient preference for EMPs (6/6), and daily tasks were easily completed whilst attached to the EMP. Nurses (5/5) also preffered the pumps, and the majority reported them as easy to use. The review has identified the need for further research in the area. Evidence for the use of EMPs to administer antibiotics in the inpatient setting is scarce, and more work is needed to understand the advantages to patients, to healthcare workers and from an antimicrobial stewardship perspective. Potential disadvantages that may put patients at risk also need investigating.",0
Patient Preferences for Lung Cancer Interception Therapy.,"IMPORTANCE: Interception therapy requires individuals to undergo treatment to prevent a future medical event, but little is known about preferences of individuals at high risk for lung cancer and whether they would be interested in this type of treatment. OBJECTIVE: To explore preferences of individuals at high risk for lung cancer for potential interception therapies to reduce this risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study used a discrete-choice experiment and included hypothetical lung cancer interception treatments with 4 attributes: reduction in lung cancer risk over 3 years, injection site reaction severity, nonfatal serious infection, and death from serious infection. Respondents were assigned to a baseline lung cancer risk of 6%, 10%, or 16% over 3 years. The discrete-choice experiment was administered online (July 13 to September 6, 2022) to US respondents eligible for lung cancer screening according to US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines. Participants included adults aged 50 to 80 years with at least a 20 pack-year smoking history. Statistical analysis was performed from September to December 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Attribute-level preference weights were estimated, and conditional relative attribute importance, maximum acceptable risks, and minimum acceptable benefits were calculated. Characteristics of respondents who always selected no treatment were also explored. RESULTS: Of the 803 survey respondents, 495 (61.6%) were female, 138 (17.2%) were African American or Black, 55 (6.8%) were Alaska Native, American Indian, or Native American, 44 (5.5%) were Asian or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 104 (13.0%) were Hispanic, Latin American, or Latinx, and 462 (57.5%) were White, Middle Eastern or North African, or a race or ethnicity not listed; and mean (SD) age was 63.0 (7.5) years. Most respondents were willing to accept interception therapy and viewed reduction in lung cancer risk as the most important attribute. Respondents would accept a greater than or equal to a 12.0 percentage point increase in risk of nonfatal serious infection if lung cancer risk was reduced by at least 20.0 percentage points; and a greater than or equal to 1.2 percentage point increase in risk of fatal serious infection if lung cancer risk was reduced by at least 30.0 percentage points. Respondents would require at least a 15.4 (95% CI, 10.6-20.2) percentage point decrease in lung cancer risk to accept a 12.0 percentage point increase in risk of nonfatal serious infection; and at least a 23.1 (95% CI, 16.4-29.8) percentage point decrease in lung cancer risk to accept a 1.2 percentage point increase in risk of death from serious infection. Respondents who were unwilling to accept interception therapy in any question (129 [16.1%]) were more likely to be older and to currently smoke with no prior cessation attempt, and less likely to have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or examined for skin cancer. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of individuals at high risk of lung cancer, most respondents were willing to consider interception therapy. These results suggest the importance of benefit-risk assessments for future lung cancer interception treatments.",1
"Dissemination and implementation of clinical practice guidelines: a longitudinal, mixed-methods evaluation of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care's knowledge translation efforts.","BACKGROUND: The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (task force) develops evidence-based preventive health care guidelines and knowledge translation (KT) tools to facilitate guideline dissemination and implementation. We aimed to determine practitioners' awareness of task force guidelines and KT tools and explore barriers and facilitators to their use. METHODS: The task force's KT team completed annual evaluations using surveys and interviews with primary care providers in Canada from 2014 to 2020, to assess practitioners' awareness and determinants of use of task force guidelines and tools. We transcribed interviews verbatim and double-coded them using a framework analysis approach. RESULTS: A total of 1284 primary care practitioners completed surveys and 183 participated in interviews. On average, 79.9% of participants were aware of the task force's 7 cancer screening guidelines, 36.2% were aware of the other 6 screening guidelines and 18.6% were aware of the 3 lifestyle or prevention guidelines. Participants identified 13 barriers and 7 facilitators to guideline and KT tool implementation; these were consistent over time. Participants identified strategies at the public and patient, provider and health systems levels to improve uptake of guidelines. INTERPRETATION: Canadian primary care practitioners were more aware of task force cancer screening guidelines than its other preventive health guidelines. Over the 6-year period, participants consistently reported barriers to guideline uptake, including misalignment with patient preferences and other provincial or specialty guideline organizations. Further evaluations will assess tailored strategies to address the barriers identified.",0
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), one of the most common causes of liver disease, is an increasingly common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several demographic, clinical, and genetic factors contribute to HCC risk in NAFLD patients, which may inform risk stratification scores. Proven efficacious approaches to primary prevention approach in patients with non-viral liver disease remain an area of need. Semi-annual surveillance is associated with improved early tumor detection and reduced HCC-related mortality; however, patients with NAFLD have several challenges to effective surveillance, including under-recognition of at-risk patients, low surveillance utilization in clinical practice, and lower sensitivity of current tools for early-stage HCC detection. Treatment decisions are best made in a multidisciplinary fashion and are informed by several factors including tumor burden, liver dysfunction, performance status, and patient preferences. Although patients with NAFLD often have larger tumor burden and increased comorbidities compared to counterparts, they can achieve similar post-treatment survival with careful patient selection. Therefore, surgical therapies continue to provide a curative treatment option for patients diagnosed at an early stage. Although there has been debate about the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with NAFLD, current data are insufficient to change treatment selection based on liver disease etiology.",0
Infliximab vs adalimumab: Points to consider when selecting anti-tumor necrosis factor agents in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease.,"Biologic agents with various mechanisms against Crohn's disease (CD) have been released and are widely used in clinical practice. However, two anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADL), are the only biologic agents approved by the Food and Drug Administration for pediatric CD currently. Therefore, in pediatric CD, the choice of biologic agents should be made more carefully to achieve the therapeutic goal. There are currently no head-to-head trials of biologic agents in pediatric or adult CD. There is a lack of accumulated data for pediatric CD, which requires the extrapolation of adult data for the positioning of biologics in pediatric CD. From a pharmacokinetic point of view, IFX is more advantageous than ADL when the inflammatory burden is high, and ADL is expected to be advantageous over IFX in sustaining remission in the maintenance phase. Additionally, we reviewed the safety profile, immunogenicity, preference, and compliance between IFX and ADL and provide practical insights into the choice of anti-TNF therapy in pediatric CD. Careful evaluation of clinical indications and disease behavior is essential when prescribing anti-TNF agents. In addition, factors such as the efficacy of induction and maintenance of remission, safety profile, immunogenicity, patient preference, and compliance play an important role in evaluating and selecting treatment options.",0
Patient preferences for pilonidal sinus treatments: a discrete choice experiment survey.,"BACKGROUND: A range of treatments are available for pilonidal sinus disease (PSD), each of which has a different risk/benefit profile. The aim of this study was to collect patient views on which interventions they would rather avoid and which outcomes they most value for PSD. METHOD: We conducted an online survey using the discrete choice experiment (DCE) method. DCE task involved participants choosing the best treatment option when presented with a set of competing hypothetical treatment profiles. Participants with symptomatic PSD, referred for elective surgery were recruited from 33 NHS trusts between 2020 and 2022. Collected DCE data were analysed using regression analyses. RESULTS: One hundred and eleven participants completed the survey. In the overall group, low risk of infection/persistence was the most important characteristic when making a treatment decision (attribute importance score of 70%), followed by treatments with shorter recovery time with an attribute importance score of 30%. The results demonstrated that patients are willing to accept trade-offs between treatment recovery time and risk of infection/persistence. Patients above 30 years old are willing to accept a higher chance of treatment failure in exchange for rapid treatment recovery (risk tolerance between 22.35 - 34.67 percentage points). Conversely, patients in the younger age groups, were risk averse, and were only willing to accept a small risk 1.51-2.15 in exchange for a treatment with faster recovery time. All patient groups appear to the reject the excision and leave open technique due to the need for protracted nursing care. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the need for shared decision making when it comes to surgery for PSD.",1
Preference for primary care in Chinese homebound patients.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the preference for primary healthcare (PHC) and investigate associated factors among homebound residents in both rural and urban areas of China. It provides valuable insights to facilitate the rational allocation of healthcare resources and promote the utilization of PHC. METHODS: In this nationally representative cross-sectional study, we utilized the most recent data (2020) from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). Participants were recruited from 25 provincial-level administrative regions in both rural and urban areas of China. Homebound patients were asked to provide details about their individual characteristics, variables related to family caregiving, and preferences for PHC. Multivariable logistic models were used to analyze potential factors associated with preference for PHC. Estimates of association were reported as odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The study found that 58.43% of rural patients reported a preference for PHC, while 42.78% of urban patients favored PHC. Compared to rural participants who did not received inpatient care in the past year, those who received inpatient care in the past year had 67% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR:0.33, 95% CI:0.19-0.59); Compared to rural participants who did not received family caregiving when ill, those who received family caregiving when ill had 59% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.41, 95% CI:0.21-0.77). Correspondingly, Compared to urban participants who did not received inpatient care in the past year, those who had received inpatient care in the past year had 75% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.10-0.56); Compared to urban participants who did not received family caregiving when ill, those who received family caregiving when ill had 73% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.11-0.63); Compared to urban participants who with agricultural Hukou, those with Non-agricultural Hukou had 61% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.39, 95% CI:0.18-0.83); Compared to urban participants living in the eastern part of mainland China, those living in the central part of China had 188% higher odds of choosing PHC (OR: 2.88, 95% CI: 1.14-7.29). CONCLUSION: Policymakers should focus on tailoring PHC to vulnerable populations and prioritizing family-based public health strategies for enhancing homebound patients' perceptions of PHC. Furthermore, further study is needed on whether the Hukou registration system affects the barriers that homebound patients experience in choosing healthcare providers.",0

Pharmacists' perspectives on recommending herbal medicines for acute infections: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Community pharmacists have an essential role in antimicrobial stewardship by providing self-care advice for self-limiting infections. AIM: To explore community pharmacists' perceptions and experiences of advising patients on management of acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and urinary tract infections (UTIs), and to explore issues regarding use of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, including herbal medicines. DESIGN & SETTING: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with community pharmacists in England. METHOD: Qualitative interviews with community pharmacists were carried out face to face and by telephone between November 2019 and March 2020. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews, recorded and transcribed. A reflexive thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: In total, 18 community pharmacists were interviewed. Three main themes were identified. Theme 1 was self-management recommendations. Community pharmacists considered patients' preferences when recommending self-management strategies. Some believed that conventional OTC medications had quicker and stronger effects, while others preferred herbal OTCs as a more natural approach, particularly for less severe symptoms. Theme 2 was factors influencing pharmacists' recommendations for acute infections. This included pharmacists' perceptions of patient preferences, nature or severity of illness, research evidence, training, commercial pressures, and patient concerns about medication cost. Theme 3 was pharmacist-patient communication. Pharmacists sometimes experienced challenges with language barriers and patients' expectations of receiving antibiotics. Pharmacists emphasised the importance of being trusted by their patients. There was widespread acceptance of their role in self-management advice for acute illness and interest in the role of herbal medicines, but pharmacists did not feel confident in recommending these. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists are central to the management of self-limiting infections. There is a need to educate the public about appropriate use of antibiotics and provide training and support for pharmacists on self-management strategies including herbal medicine.",0
Patient motivators to use opioids for acute pain after emergency care.,"INTRODUCTION: Patients are stakeholders in their own pain management. Factors motivating individuals to seek or use opioids therapeutically for treatment of acute pain are not well characterized but could be targeted to reduce incident iatrogenic opioid use disorder (OUD). Emergency departments (EDs) commonly encounter patients in acute pain for whom decisions regarding opioid therapy are required. Decision-making is necessarily challenged in episodic, unscheduled care settings given time pressure, limited information, and lack of pre-existing patient provider relationship. Patients may decline to take prescribed opioids or conversely seek opioids from other providers or non-medical sources. METHODS: Using a framework analysis approach, we qualitatively analyzed transcripts from 29 patients after discharge from an ED visit for acute pain at a large, urban, academic hospital in the midwestern United States to describe motivating factors influencing patient decisions regarding opioid use for acute pain. A semi-structured interview guide framed participant discussion in either a focus group or interview transcribed and analyzed with conventional content analysis. RESULTS: Four major themes emerged from our analysis including a) pain management literacy, b) control preferences, c) risk tolerance, and d) cues to action. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest targets for future intervention development and a framework to guide the engagement of patients as stakeholders in their own acute pain management.",0
Patient and caregiver preferences for haemophilia treatments: A discrete-choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: An evolving haemophilia treatment landscape provides new possibilities for previously unattainable lifestyles. AIM: We sought to understand how people with haemophilia (PwH) and their caregivers value the potential benefits of novel prophylactic treatments. We conducted a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) to quantify preferences for features of haemophilia treatments among adults and caregivers of children with haemophilia. A best-worst scaling (BWS) exercise measured the perceived burden of treatment administration features. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was administered to male adults (≥18 years) and caregivers of male children (≤17 years) living with haemophilia in the United States. Respondents evaluated eight pairs of hypothetical haemophilia treatment profiles defined by six attributes in the DCE and 15 features in the BWS. RESULTS: In the DCE, both adults with haemophilia (n = 151) and caregivers (n = 151) prioritised avoiding the risk of developing inhibitor/ anti-drug antibodies and treatments that allowed for a more active life. They placed a lower priority on reducing the number of spontaneous bleeding episodes, route and frequency of administration, and avoiding the risk of hospitalisation due to adverse events. The BWS documented the burdensomeness of IV infusions and medications that require mixing and refrigeration. CONCLUSION: PwH and caregivers prefer treatments that enable a more active lifestyle with a lower risk of inhibitor development. Both groups valued the ability to lead an active life over reducing spontaneous bleeding, with caregivers placing the most weight on this attribute. As new treatments expand possibilities, healthcare professionals and PwH should continue to share decision-making, incorporating clinical judgment and individual preferences.",1
Improving Hands-Free Speech Rehabilitation in Laryngectomized Patients with a Moldable Adhesive.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the product performance of a new moldable peristomal adhesive with corresponding heating pad designed to facilitate and improve automatic speaking valve (ASV) fixation for hands-free speech in laryngectomized patients. METHODS: Twenty laryngectomized patients, all regular adhesive users with prior ASV experience, were included. Study-specific questionnaires were used for data collection at baseline and after two weeks of moldable adhesive use. The primary outcome parameters were adhesive lifetime during hands-free speech, use and duration of hands-free speech, and patient preference. Additional outcome parameters were satisfaction, comfort, fit, and usability. RESULTS: The moldable adhesive enabled ASV fixation adequate for hands-free speech in the majority of participants. Overall, the moldable adhesive significantly increased adhesive lifetime and duration of hands-free speech compared to participants' baseline adhesives (p < 0.05), regardless of stoma depth, skin irritation, or regular use of hands-free speech at baseline. The participants who preferred the moldable adhesive (55% of participants) experienced a significant increase in the adhesive lifetime (median of 24 h, range 8-144 h) and improved comfort, fit, and ease of speech. CONCLUSION: The moldable adhesive's lifetime and functional aspects, including the ease of use and custom fit, are encouraging outcomes and enable more laryngectomized patients to use hands-free speech more regularly. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 133:2965-2970, 2023.",0

"Getting to know our patients and what matters: exploring the elicitation of patient values, preferences, and circumstances in neurological rehabilitation.","PURPOSE: Patient values, preferences, and circumstances are critical to decision-making in both patient-centred and evidence-based practice models of healthcare. Despite the established importance of integrating these patient attributes, the ways they are elicited in rehabilitation remain unclear. This study aimed to explore how health professionals elicit and share patients' 'values', 'preferences', and 'circumstances', and what they understand by the terms. METHODS: This exploratory qualitative descriptive study used interviews with 13 clinicians from interprofessional teams in inpatient neurological rehabilitation. Data were analysed using a general inductive approach. RESULTS: Participants understood 'values' to mean what is important and meaningful; 'preferences' as likes/dislikes and choices; and 'circumstances' as the social, physical, and environmental context surrounding the person. Formal and informal strategies were used to gather information directly from patients or indirectly from other sources. The processes of eliciting and communicating this information were influenced by relationships and relied on contributions from many people. Elicitation involved a flexible approach tailored to the individual and considering each unique context. CONCLUSION: The strategies used and the approach used to implement these strategies were both essential to eliciting patient values, preferences, and circumstances in neurological rehabilitation. These findings offer insights into the practices of interprofessional rehabilitation clinicians. Implications for rehabilitationEliciting patient values, preferences, and circumstances involves a combination of strategies and approaches that are applied gradually throughout the continuum of rehabilitation.These processes are flexible, and strategies should be tailored to individual patients/families and phases of rehabilitation.Clinicians should be attentive to informal opportunities to gather valuable information throughout rehabilitation.Establishing positive relationships and using effective communication is foundational to these processes.",0
Seizure Medications.,"The mainstay treatment strategy for seizures is medication management. However, much like the prescription of any other pharmaceutical agent, a clinician must balance efficacy with adverse events, and provide consideration for cost, drug interactions, patient preference, and availability. This activity outlines the indications, mechanisms of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of various seizure medications, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating indicated disorders as part of the interprofessional team with seizure medications, with a basis on the current knowledge for optimal utilization.",0
Experiences of and recommendations on clinical trial design in Alzheimer's disease from the participant's point of view: a mixed-methods study in two clinical trial centers in the Netherlands.,"INTRODUCTION: In the context of the development of pharmaceutical interventions, expectations and experiences of participants are essential. Their insights may be particularly helpful to address the challenges of recruiting and retaining participants for Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. We examined clinical trial participants' experiences to optimize trial design in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHOD: In this mixed-methods study, we included adults who participated in sponsor-initiated AD trials at Brain Research Center, a clinical trial organization in the Netherlands. Participants (N = 71, age 69 ± 6.5, 54%F, 19 cognitively normal (CN), 19 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 33 AD dementia) first completed an online survey. Diagnostic group differences were investigated using chi-square tests or one-way ANOVAs. Next, a subsample (N = 12; 8 = CN, 4 = MCI) participated in focus groups to gain in-depth insight into their opinions on optimizing trial design from a participants' point of view. Audio recordings from focus group interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by thematic content analysis by two independent researchers. RESULTS: Most reported motives for enrolment included ""to benefit future generations"" (89%), followed by ""for science"" (66%) and ""better monitoring"" (42%). Frequent suggestions for increasing willingness to participate included a smaller chance to receive placebo (n = 38, 54%), shorter travel times (n = 27, 38%), and sharing individual results of different assessments (n = 57, 80%), as well as receiving trial results (n = 52, 73). Highest visual analogue burden scores (0-100) were found for the lumbar puncture (M = 47.2, SD = 38.2) and cognitive assessments (M = 27.2, SD = 25.7). Results did not differ between diagnostic groups, nor between patient and caregiver participants (all p-values>.05). Two additional themes emerged from the focus groups: ""trial design,"" such as follow-up visit(s) after participating, and ""trial center,"" including the relevance of a professional and empathic staff. CONCLUSION: Relevant factors include expectation management and careful planning of high-burden assessments, provision of individual feedback, and prioritizing professionalism and empathy throughout conduct of the trial. Our findings provide insight into participants' priorities to increase willingness to participate and can be used to optimize trial success.",0
Assessing Patients' Preferences for Preventive Dental Care: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"Background It is crucial to recognize patients' behavioral responses to improve oral healthcare delivery. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) is typically used to measure service user preferences. The purpose of this study was to examine the preferences of the Saudi population regarding primary dental care using a DCE. Materials and methods An online DCE survey was distributed among adults aged 18 years and older living in Saudi Arabia. An orthogonal design was used to reduce the number of combinations while maintaining the main effects that reflect patient preferences. Respondents were presented with a reduced set of 10 cards (tasks), and each of the cards had two concepts (offers). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the sample characteristics. The coefficients were calculated based on discrete choice results on the Qualtrics platform. Results A total of 532 participants completed the survey. Among patients seeking a preventive dental visit, the ability to get an appointment was rated the most important influence on their decision with a relative importance of 41%, followed by the dental care provider (29%) and the dental clinic in relation to the sector and the fees (20%). The least important attribute was the waiting time in minutes, with a relative importance of 10%. Conclusion The study findings revealed that patients make trade-offs when deciding to receive primary dental care. Policymakers can use the study's findings to inform their decisions concerning dental clinic services. The study results suggest that it is possible to improve access to primary dental care by improving the accessibility of appointments.",1
Safety in Teletriage by Nurses and Physicians in the United States and Israel: Narrative Review and Qualitative Study.,"BACKGROUND: The safety of telemedicine in general and telephone triage (teletriage) safety in particular have been a focus of concern since the 1970s. Today, telehealth, now subsuming teletriage, has a basic structure and process intended to promote safety. However, inadequate telehealth systems may also compromise patient safety. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated rapid but uneven telehealth growth, both technologically and professionally. Within 5-10 years, the field will likely be more technologically advanced; however, these advances may still outpace professional standards. The need for an evidence-based system is crucial and urgent. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore ways that developed teletriage systems produce safe outcomes by examining key system components and questioning long-held assumptions. METHODS: We examined safety by performing a narrative review of the literature using key terms concerning patient safety in teletriage. In addition, we conducted system analysis of 2 typical formal systems, physician led and nurse led, in Israel and the United States, respectively, and evaluated those systems' respective approaches to safety. Additionally, we conducted in-depth interviews with representative physicians and 1 nurse using a qualitative approach. RESULTS: The review of literature indicated that research on various aspects of telehealth and teletriage safety is still sparse and of variable quality, producing conflicting and inconsistent results. Researchers, possibly unfamiliar with this complicated field, use an array of poorly defined terms and appear to design studies based on unfounded assumptions. The interviews with health care professionals demonstrated several challenges encountered during teletriage, mainly making diagnosis from a distance, treating unfamiliar patients, a stressful atmosphere, working alone, and technological difficulties. However, they reported using several measures that help them make accurate diagnoses and reasonable decisions, thus keeping patient safety, such as using their expertise and intuition, using structured protocols, and considering nonmedical factors and patient preferences (shared decision-making). CONCLUSIONS: Remote encounters about acute, worrisome symptoms are time sensitive, requiring decision-making under conditions of uncertainty and urgency. Patient safety and safe professional practice are extremely important in the field of teletriage, which has a high potential for error. This underregulated subspecialty lacks adequate development and substantive research on system safety. Research may commingle terminology and widely different, ill-defined groups of decision makers with wide variation in decision-making skills, clinical training, experience, and job qualifications, thereby confounding results. The rapid pace of telehealth's technological growth creates urgency in identifying safe systems to guide developers and clinicians about needed improvements.",0
Lifetime Management of Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis in the Era of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular disease. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) using mechanical valves has been the preferred treatment for younger patients, but bioprosthetic valves are gaining favour to avoid anticoagulation with warfarin. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was approved in recent years for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis in intermediate- and low-risk patients as an alternative to SAVR. The longer life expectancy of these groups of patients might exceed the durability of the TAVR or SAVR bioprosthetic valves. Therefore, many patients need 2 or even 3 interventions during their lifetime. Because it has important implications on the feasibility of subsequent procedures, the decision between opting for SAVR or TAVR as the primary procedure requires thorough consideration by the heart team, incorporating patient preferences, clinical indicators, and anatomic aspects. If TAVR is favoured initially, selecting the valve type and determining the implantation level should be conducted, aiming for positive outcomes in the index intervention and keeping in mind the potential for subsequent TAVR-in-TAVR procedures. When SAVR is selected as the primary procedure, the operator must make choices regarding the valve type and the potential need for aortic root enlargement, with the intention of facilitating future valve-in-valve interventions. This narrative review examines the existing evidence concerning the lifelong management of severe aortic stenosis, delving into available treatment strategies, particularly emphasising the initial procedure's selection and its impact on subsequent interventions.",0
The Impact of Substantial Improvements in HbA1c and Weight Loss on the Medication Preferences of People with Type 2 Diabetes.,"PURPOSE: To quantify the preferences of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) for treatment attributes of a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) versus an injectable GLP-1 RA medication profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Injection-naive people taking oral medications for T2D in the US and UK completed a web survey including a discrete choice experiment to quantify patients' preferences for five treatment attributes: delivery system, frequency of nausea, frequency of hypoglycemia, HbA1c reduction, and weight reduction. Attributes and levels were based on head-to-head clinical trial data of tirzepatide 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg versus semaglutide 1mg. Preference data were analyzed separately by country using multinomial mixed logit (MXL) models. MXL parameters were used to estimate the predicted preference for each tirzepatide dose versus semaglutide 1mg. Direct preferences for each dose of tirzepatide versus semaglutide 1mg were elicited. RESULTS: Participants (N=620) in the US (N=301) and UK (N=319) were 50.8% and 50.5% female with mean ages of 60.7 years and 58.9 years, respectively. The order and magnitude of relative attribute importance (RAI) scores differed between countries. HbA1c reduction (26.3%) had the greatest impact on US participants' preferences, and hypoglycemia (32.8%) did among UK participants. Attribute-level marginal utility results indicated preferences for greater HbA1c improvements, the single-use pre-filled pen, lower hypoglycemia, greater weight reductions, and lower frequency of nausea. Assuming the availability of only tirzepatide or semaglutide 1mg, the predicted preference for tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15mg) in the US is 95.6% (vs 4.4% for semaglutide 1mg) and in the UK was 86.3% (vs 13.7% for semaglutide 1mg). CONCLUSION: HbA1c reduction, frequency of hypoglycemia, and weight reduction are key drivers of preferences among people with T2D when considering medication options. Overall, people with T2D are likely to prefer the tirzepatide over the semaglutide 1mg medication profiles.",1
Barriers and enablers to deprescribing of older adults and their caregivers: a systematic review and meta-synthesis.,"PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to identify the barriers and enablers to deprescribing from the viewpoint of community-dwelling older adults and their caregivers. METHODS: This meta-synthesis included a systematic review of the literature and an inductive thematic synthesis. Medline and EMBASE were searched for studies that qualitatively explored the perspectives of older adults or their caregivers on deprescribing. Studies had to use qualitative methodologies and include community-dwelling adults (or their caregivers) aged 60 years or older who were taking one or more chronic medications. The quality of studies was assessed using the CASP tool. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in the meta-synthesis. All studies included older adults, and 3 included caregivers or companions. Four barriers were identified: favorable perceptions of medications, fear of medication discontinuation, the complexity of the healthcare system and discouragement from healthcare professionals; and seven enablers were identified: medication safety concerns, patient autonomy and confidence, education, follow-up, deprescribing strategies, relationships with physicians, and patient-perceived benefits of deprescribing. CONCLUSION: Multiple barriers and enablers to deprescribing exist within the older adult population. Health system complexity and direct discouragement from healthcare providers were barriers uniquely identified in the older adult population. This population would benefit from interventions to increase their medication literacy, confidence, and autonomy in the deprescribing journey.",0
Clinical decision-making in older patients with cancer: a cross-sectional single-centre study to assess the impact of clinical judgement and patient preferences.,"OBJECTIVE: The heterogeneity in the population of older patients with cancer makes clinical decision-making difficult. We investigated the agreement between the G8 score and clinical judgment in frailty assessments, determined the impact of a life-expectancy calculator, and explored patient and caregiver preferences towards the treatment goal. METHODS: Patients aged ≥75 years in need of new oncological treatment were prospectively enrolled between June 2020 and February 2021. Frailty was estimated by the oncologist and caregiver and compared to the G8 estimation. We examined whether the oncologist changed the fit/frail estimation based on life expectancy calculated using the ePrognosis tool. The main treatment goals, either longevity or quality of life (QoL), from the patient's and caregiver's perspective were noted and compared. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were included in the analysis. Comparison of the oncologist's and the caregiver's frailty estimation with the G8 assessment showed agreement and a Kappa coefficient of 58.3% (0.231) and 60% (0.255), respectively. The ePrognosis score and the odds of change in the frailty estimation by the oncologist showed no correlation. Regarding preferences, 28 (57.1%) and 17 (34.7%) patients and eighteen (47.3%) and seventeen (44.7%) caregivers chose longevity and QoL, respectively. The observed agreement and Kappa coefficient were 78.8% and 0.578. CONCLUSION: Compared to the G8 assessment, frailty was underestimated by both oncologists and caregivers. Most of the patients chose longevity over QoL, and the preferences between the patient and the caregiver matched in the majority of cases.",0
Patient attitudes and preferences about expanded noninvasive prenatal testing.,"Introduction: Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is typically carried out to screen for common fetal chromosomal anomalies, with the option to screen for a wider range of chromosomal changes (expanded NIPT) becoming increasingly available. However, little is known about pregnant patients' attitudes and preferences regarding expanded NIPT. Methods: To address this gap, we surveyed general-risk patients having first-tier cfDNA screening at a private prenatal clinic on their expectations for expanded NIPT. Patients were asked questions regarding their current pregnancy and previous pregnancy history, their opinions on fetal DNA screenings during pregnancy and incidental findings, information and opinions on financial resources for NIPT, as well as socio-cultural questions to determine patient demographics. Results: Of the 200 survey participants, the majority were educated, self-reported as white, had a higher than average income, and reported no aneuploidy risk factors. When asked what information they would like to receive from cfDNA screening, the vast majority of participants wanted all information available that could have an immediate impact on fetal health (88%) or an immediate impact on infant health from birth (82%). Many participants also wanted information that could have a future impact on the child's health or an immediate or future impact on the pregnant woman's own health. Most participants wanted information about the sex of fetus (86%) and common trisomies (71%), with almost half of participants desiring information about rare autosomal aneuploidies and/or all genetic information that may affect the baby. In addition, participants were found to be comfortable screening for conditions that are well-known, influence care during pregnancy, and are treatable. Finally, while most respondents either had insurance coverage for NIPT or were able to afford NIPT out of pocket, the majority of our participants felt that expanded NIPT should be either free for everyone or for those considered high risk. Discussion: Our findings suggest that with appropriate pre-test counseling, pregnant patients may choose NIPT for an expanding list of conditions.",0
Patient Preferences for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treatments: A Discrete-Choice Experiment.,"Treatments for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have varying benefit-risk profiles. We elicited 200 US patients' preferences for attributes associated with various first-line systemic treatments for unresectable HCC in a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey. Respondents answered nine DCE questions, each offering a choice between two hypothetical treatment profiles defined by six attributes with varying levels: overall survival (OS), months of maintained daily function, severity of palmar-plantar syndrome, severity of hypertension, risk of digestive-tract bleeding, and mode and frequency of administration. A random-parameters logit model was used to analyze the preference data. Patients regarded an additional 10 months of maintaining daily function without decline to be as important or more important than 10 additional months of OS, on average. Respondents valued avoiding moderate-to-severe palmar-plantar syndrome and hypertension more than extended OS. A respondent would require >10 additional months of OS (the greatest increase presented in the study) on average to offset the increased burden of adverse events. Patients with unresectable HCC prioritize avoiding adverse events that would severely impact their quality of life over mode and frequency of administration or digestive-tract bleeding risk. For some patients with unresectable HCC, maintaining daily functioning is as important or more important than the survival benefit of a treatment.",1
Telehealth Complementary and Integrative Health Therapies During COVID-19 at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.,"Background: Complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies, such as in-person acupuncture, chiropractic care, and meditation, are evidence-based nonpharmaceutical treatment options for pain. During COVID-19, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) delivered several CIH therapies virtually. This study explores veterans' utilization, advantages/disadvantages, and delivery issues of yoga, Tai Chi, meditation/mindfulness (self-care), and massage, chiropractic, and acupuncture (practitioner-delivered care), using telephone/video at 18 VA sites during COVID-19. Methods: Use of virtual care was examined quantitatively with VA administrative data for six CIH therapies before and after COVID-19 onset (2019-2021). Advantages/disadvantages and health care delivery issues of these CIH therapies through virtual care were examined qualitatively using interview data (2020-2021). Results: Overall, televisits represented a substantial portion of all CIH self-care therapies delivered by VA in 2020 (53.7%) and 2021 (82.1%), as sites developed virtual group classes using VA secure online video platforms in response to COVID-19. In contrast, a small proportion of all encounters with acupuncturists, chiropractors, and massage therapists was telephone/video encounters in 2020 (17.3%) and in 2021 (5.4%). These were predominantly one-on-one care in the form of education, follow-ups, home exercises, assessments/evaluations, or acupressure. Delivery issues included technical difficulties, lack of access to needed technology, difficulty tracking virtual visits, and capacity restrictions. Advantages included increased access to self-care, increased patient receptivity to engaging in self-care, and flexibility in staffing online group classes. Disadvantages included patient preference, patient safety, and strain on staffing. Conclusion: Despite delivery issues or disadvantages of tele-CIH self-care, veterans' use of teleself-care CIH therapies grew substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
"Discrepancy in responses to the surprise question between hemodialysis nurses and physicians, with focus on patient clinical characteristics: A comparative study.","INTRODUCTION: The surprise question (SQ) ""Would I be surprised if this patient died within the next xx months"" can be used by different professions to foresee the need of serious illness conversations in patients approaching end of life. However, little is known about the different perspectives of nurses and physicians in responses to the SQ and factors influencing their appraisals. The aim was to explore nurses' and physicians' responses to the SQ regarding patients on hemodialysis, and to investigate how these answers were associated with patient clinical characteristics. METHODS: This comparative cross-sectional study included 361 patients for whom 112 nurses and 15 physicians responded to the SQ regarding 6 and 12 months. Patient characteristics, performance status, and comorbidities were obtained. Cohen's kappa was used to analyze the interrater agreement between nurses and physicians in their responses to the SQ and multivariable logistic regression was applied to reveal the independent association to patient clinical characteristics. FINDINGS: Proportions of nurses and physicians responding to the SQ with ""no, not surprised"" was similar regarding 6 and 12 months. However, there was a substantial difference concerning which specific patient the nurses and physicians responded ""no, not surprised"", within 6 (κ = 0.366, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.288-0.474) and 12 months (κ = 0.379, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.281-0.477). There were also differences in the patient clinical characteristics associated with nurses' and physicians' responses to the SQ. DISCUSSION: Nurses and physicians have different perspectives in their appraisal when responding to the SQ for patients on hemodialysis. This may reinforce the need for communication and discussion between nurses and physicians to identify the need of serious illness conversations in patients approaching the end of life, in order to adapt hemodialysis care to patient preferences and needs.",0
The Impact of Video-Based Educational Materials with Voiceovers on Preferences for Glucose Monitoring Technology in Patients with Diabetes: A Randomised Study.,"INTRODUCTION: Ensuring patients have enough information about healthcare choices prior to completing a preference study is necessary to support the validity of the findings. Patients are commonly informed using text-based information with supporting graphics. Video-based information may be more engaging for the general patient population. This study aimed to assess (1) the impact that educating patients using video-based educational materials with a voiceover has on patient preferences compared to traditional text, and (2) whether this impact is consistent between two countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A video-based educational tool was developed to inform patients prior to completing a discrete choice experiment assessing preferences for glucose monitors. Patients with diabetes from the Netherlands and Poland were recruited through an online research panel. Respondents were randomised to receive information in either a text or a video with animations and a voiceover. Data were analysed using a mixed-logit model. RESULTS: N = 981 completed surveys were analysed from the Netherlands (n = 459) and Poland (n = 522). Differences were found between the countries, but no interpretable pattern of differences was found between the two types of educational materials. Patients spent less time in the educational material than would be necessary to fully review all of the content. CONCLUSIONS: Simply providing educational material in a video with animations and voiceovers does not necessarily lead to better engagement from respondents or different preference outcomes in a sample of diabetes patients when compared to text. Increasing engagement with educational materials should be a topic of future research for those conducting patient preference research as no amount of educational material will be helpful if respondents do not access it.",1
Predictors of Informed People's Preferences for Statin Therapy to Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Risk: an Internet Survey Study.,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines suggest clinicians inform patients about their 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; however, little is known about how the risk estimate influences patients' preferences for statin therapy for primary prevention. OBJECTIVE: To define predictors of preference for statin therapy after participants were informed about their individualized benefits and harms. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey in 2020. SETTING: Online US survey panel. PARTICIPANTS: A national sample of 304 respondents aged 40 to 75 who had not previously taken a statin and who knew their cholesterol levels and blood pressure measurements. INTERVENTION: Participants entered their risk factors into a calculator which estimated their 10-year CVD risk. They were then provided with an estimate of their absolute risk reduction with a statin and the chance of side effects from meta-analyses. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: We used a hierarchical model to predict participants' preferences for statin therapy according to their 10-year CVD risk, perceptions of the magnitude of statin benefit (large, medium, small, or almost no benefit), worry about side effects (very worried, somewhat worried, a little worried, not worried at all), and other variables. KEY RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 55 years (SD = 9.9); 50% were female, 44% were non-white, and 16% had a high school degree or less education. After reviewing their benefits and side effects, 45% of the participants reported they probably or definitely wanted to take a statin. In the full hierarchical model, only perceived benefits of taking a statin was a significant independent predictor of wanting a statin (OR 7.3, 95% CI 4.7, 12.2). LIMITATIONS: Participants were from an internet survey panel and making hypothetical decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Participants' perceptions of their benefit from statin therapy predicted wanting to take a statin for primary prevention; neither estimated CVD risk nor worries about statin side effects were independent predictors.",0
Jargon Be Gone - Patient Preference in Doctor Communication.,"While it has been shown that healthcare providers often use medical jargon, less is known about how patients prefer their clinicians communicate. This mixed-methods study aimed to better understand the general public's preference in healthcare communication. A volunteer cohort of 205 adult attendees at the 2021 Minnesota State Fair was presented a survey with two scenarios at a doctor's office sharing the same information: one using medical terminology and one using simpler, jargon-free language. Survey participants were asked which doctor they preferred, to describe each doctor, and to explain why they believe that doctors may use medical terminology. Common descriptive themes for the jargon-using doctor included that this doctor caused confusion, was too technical, and was uncaring, while the doctor who spoke without jargon was perceived as a good communicator, caring/empathetic, and approachable. Respondents perceived a range of reasons why doctors use jargon, from not recognizing they are using words that are not understood to trying to make themselves feel more important. Overall, 91% of survey respondents preferred the doctor who communicated without medical jargon.",0
"Exploring herbal remedy utilization for wound healing: Patterns, patient preferences, and implications for nursing practice.","PURPOSE: The utilization of herbal remedies for wound healing is a notable aspect of traditional medicine practices. Understanding herbal use among patients yields insights for nursing care enhancement. This study aimed to investigate the utilization of herbal remedies for wound healing among diabetic patients. METHODS: A total of 453 participants were enrolled, with demographic data, including age, sex, occupation, education level, residence, ethnic group, distance from health service, herbal use duration, and wound duration presented. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data, including means, standard deviations, ranges, and percentages. FINDINGS: The average participant age was 55.39 years, with most being non-civil servant workers (60.3%) and having a low education level (67.1%). Indian almond wood (9.7%) and green betel (6.8%) were the most commonly used herbs for wound healing. Family members were the primary source of information (29.1%), and 43.7% obtained herbs from personal gardens. Although 94.2% of participants did not disclose herbal use to health liaisons, 53.4% used herbs specifically for wound healing. Users reported both positive and negative effects on wounds from various herbs, indicating variability in experiences. However, the consistency of herb usage by individual patients was uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified diverse herbal remedies used for wound healing among patients, driven by familial recommendations. Usage pattern diversity and effects signal necessity for researching herb safety and efficacy. Clarifying the impact of consistent herb usage on wound healing is essential for understanding patients' preferences and practices. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: These findings emphasize the importance of open communication between patients and healthcare providers regarding herbal remedy use. Nurses should acknowledge patients' preferences for traditional healing practices while ensuring they receive evidence-based care. Patient-centered herbal strategies enhance nursing practice, fostering holistic wound care. Further research can guide nursing interventions, facilitate informed decision-making, and improve patient outcomes.",0
"A Randomized, Prospective, Observer-Masked Study Comparing Dropless Treatment Regimen Using Intracanalicular Dexamethasone Insert, Intracameral Ketorolac, and Intracameral Moxifloxacin versus Conventional Topical Therapy to Control Postoperative Pain and ","PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical efficacy and patient preference for a dropless treatment regimen compared to conventional topical therapy in patients undergoing cataract surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective, contralateral eye study, patients with bilateral cataract were randomized to receive either intracanalicular dexamethasone insert, intracameral phenylephrine 1%/ketorolac 0.3%, and intracameral moxifloxacin (50 µg) (study group) or topical moxifloxacin 0.5%, ketorolac 0.5%, and prednisolone acetate 1.0% QID (control group). The second eye underwent cataract surgery 2 weeks later and was treated with the opposite treatment. All patients were evaluated at Days 1, 7, 14, 28, and 3 months. The primary outcome measure was postoperative ocular pain. Secondary outcomes included summed ocular inflammation score (SOIS; the sum of the mean anterior chamber cells and anterior flare score), the patient preference for medication protocol between the two eyes, and patient out-of-pocket cost of medications. Safety outcome measures included CDVA, intraocular pressure, central retinal thickness (CRT), and the incidence of reported AEs. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with no pain was similar in both groups at all postoperative visits (p>0.05). No statistically significant difference in SOIS score was observed between the two groups at any visit. A strong majority of the patients (94.7%) preferred the study eye's dropless regimen over the control eye's conventional topical therapy regimen. No statistically significant difference in mean intraocular pressure (IOP) was observed at any postoperative visit, except at Week 1. The mean CDVA was also similar in both groups at all postoperative visits (p>0.05). The postoperative mean CRT was comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION: A dropless treatment regimen is as effective as topical eyedrop administration. A higher proportion of patients who underwent bilateral cataract surgery preferred the dropless treatment regimen over the patient-administered eye drop regimen.",0

The Place of Immune Reconstitution Therapy in the Management of Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis in France: An Expert Consensus.,"The treatment strategy in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) is a complex decision requiring individualization of treatment sequences to maximize clinical outcomes. Current local and international guidelines do not provide specific recommendation on the use of immune reconstitution therapy (IRT) as alternative to continuous immunosuppression in the management of RMS. The objective of the program was to provide consensus-based expert opinion on the optimal use of IRT in the management of RMS. A Delphi method was performed from May 2022 to July 2022. Nineteen clinical assertions were developed by a scientific committee and sent to 14 French clinical experts in MS alongside published literature. Two consecutive reproducible anonymous votes were conducted. Consensus on recommendations was achieved when more than 75% of the respondents agreed or disagreed with the clinical assertions. After the second round, consensus was achieved amongst 16 out of 19 propositions: 13 clinical assertions had a 100% consensus, 3 clinical assertions a consensus above 75% and 3 without consensus. Expert-agreed consensus is provided on topics related to the benefit of the early use of IRT from immunological and clinical perspectives, profiles of patients who may benefit most from the IRT strategy (e.g. patients with family planning, patient preference and lifestyle requirements). These French expert consensuses provide up-to-date relevant guidance on the use of IRT in clinical practice. The current program reflects status of knowledge in 2022 and should be updated in timely manner when further clinical data in IRT become available.",0
Atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation in patients hospitalised for stroke in the REGIONS Care Study.,"AIM: To describe atrial fibrillation (AF) patient characteristics and anticoagulation patterns in stroke patients in Aotearoa. METHODS: Reducing Ethnic and Geographic Inequities to Optimise New Zealand Stroke (REGIONS) Care study is a prospective, nation-wide observational study of consecutive adult stroke patients admitted to hospital between 1 May and 31 October 2018. AF and anticoagulation prescribing, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and differences by Māori ethnicity and hospital location are described. RESULTS: Of 2,379 patients, 807 (34.3%) had a diagnosis of AF. AF patients were older than non-AF patients (mean 79.9 [SD 11] versus 72.5 [14.2], p<0.0001). AF was diagnosed before stroke in 666 patients (82.5%), of whom 442 (66.4%) were taking an anticoagulant. The most common documented reasons for non-anticoagulation were prior bleeding (20.5%), patient preference (18.1%), frailty, comorbidities/side effects (13.2%) and falls (6.8%). The ICH rate was similar for AF patients on versus not on an anticoagulant (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-1.80). Rates and reasons for oral anticoagulant non-prescribing were similar for Māori, non-Māori, urban and non-urban populations. CONCLUSIONS: Although anticoagulation prescribing in AF has improved, one third of stroke patients with known AF were not taking an anticoagulant prior to admission and the majority did not appear to have an absolute contraindication offering a multidisciplinary opportunity for improvement. There were no significant differences for Māori and non-urban populations in anticoagulant prescribing.",0
Advance Directives.,"Advance directives are legal documents that outline an individual's preferences regarding major medical decisions. These directives specify the healthcare options that an individual desires or rejects, currently and in the future. In addition, advance directives designate one or more individuals who will act as spokespersons on behalf of the patient if they become unable to communicate their preferences. There are variations in advance directive laws from state to state. Several states have implemented specific forms of advance directives, such as Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST), Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST), Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment (MOST), Physician Orders for Scope of Treatment (POST), Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) Order/Clinician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (COLST), Transportable Physician Orders for Patient Preferences (TPOPP), or similar directives have been introduced. These forms condense the essential elements of an advance directive into a medical order format. To maintain brevity, the term ""POLST"" will be applied to encompass all the variations above in the remainder of this article.",0
SEOM-GEMCAD-TTD clinical guidelines for the systemic treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (2022).,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in Spain. Metastatic disease is present in 15-30% of patients at diagnosis and up to 20-50% of those with initially localized disease eventually develop metastases. Recent scientific knowledge acknowledges that this is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous disease. As treatment options increase, prognosis for individuals with metastatic disease has steadily improved over recent decades. Disease management should be discussed among experienced, multidisciplinary teams to select the most appropriate systemic treatment (chemotherapy and targeted agents) and to integrate surgical or ablative procedures, when indicated. Clinical presentation, tumor sidedness, molecular profile, disease extension, comorbidities, and patient preferences are key factors when designing a customized treatment plan. These guidelines seek to provide succinct recommendations for managing metastatic CRC.",0
Recent advances and controversial issues in the optimal management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis.,"OBJECTIVE: The optimal management of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (AsxCS) is enduringly controversial. We updated our 2021 Expert Review and Position Statement, focusing on recent advances in the diagnosis and management of patients with AsxCS. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed up to August 1, 2023, using PubMed/PubMed Central, EMBASE and Scopus. The following keywords were used in various combinations: ""asymptomatic carotid stenosis,"" ""carotid endarterectomy"" (CEA), ""carotid artery stenting"" (CAS), and ""transcarotid artery revascularization"" (TCAR). Areas covered included (i) improvements in best medical treatment (BMT) for patients with AsxCS and declining stroke risk, (ii) technological advances in surgical/endovascular skills/techniques and outcomes, (iii) risk factors, clinical/imaging characteristics and risk prediction models for the identification of high-risk AsxCS patient subgroups, and (iv) the association between cognitive dysfunction and AsxCS. RESULTS: BMT is essential for all patients with AsxCS, regardless of whether they will eventually be offered CEA, CAS, or TCAR. Specific patient subgroups at high risk for stroke despite BMT should be considered for a carotid revascularization procedure. These patients include those with severe (≥80%) AsxCS, transcranial Doppler-detected microemboli, plaque echolucency on Duplex ultrasound examination, silent infarcts on brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography scans, decreased cerebrovascular reserve, increased size of juxtaluminal hypoechoic area, AsxCS progression, carotid plaque ulceration, and intraplaque hemorrhage. Treatment of patients with AsxCS should be individualized, taking into consideration individual patient preferences and needs, clinical and imaging characteristics, and cultural, ethnic, and social factors. Solid evidence supporting or refuting an association between AsxCS and cognitive dysfunction is lacking. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal management of patients with AsxCS should include BMT for all individuals and a prophylactic carotid revascularization procedure (CEA, CAS, or TCAR) for some asymptomatic patient subgroups, additionally taking into consideration individual patient needs and preference, clinical and imaging characteristics, social and cultural factors, and the available stroke risk prediction models. Future studies should investigate the association between AsxCS with cognitive function and the role of carotid revascularization procedures in the progression or reversal of cognitive dysfunction.",0
