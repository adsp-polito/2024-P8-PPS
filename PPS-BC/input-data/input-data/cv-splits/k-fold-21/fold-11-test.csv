Updated Immunotherapy for Gastric Cancer.,"Gastric cancer treatments are evolving rapidly. For example, immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially those that target PD-1 or PD-L1, have long-term efficacy in a subset of gastric cancer patients, and are currently the first-line therapy. Immunotherapies approved for use in untreated gastric cancer patients include monotherapy and chemotherapy-immunotherapy combinations. Major clinical trials have reported efficacy and safety data suggesting that PD-L1 expression is important for regimen selection, although other biomarkers, clinicopathologic factors, and patient preference might also be relevant in other situations. Currently, several novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies are being assessed, which might refine the current treatment paradigm. In this review, we describe the current treatment regimens for patients with gastric cancer and detail the approach we use for the selection of first-line immunotherapy regimens.",0
Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options for pain relief during labor: an expert review.,"Labor pain is among the most severe types of physical pain that women may experience during their lifetime. Thus, pain relief is an essential part of medical care during childbirth. Epidural analgesia is considered to be the most efficient method of pain relief during labor. Nevertheless, patient preferences, contraindications, limited availability, and technical failure may require the use of alternative pain reliving methods during labor including systemic pharmacologic agents, and nonpharmacologic methods. Nonpharmacologic methods for pain alleviation during vaginal birth have become popular over the years, either as a complement to pharmacologic agents or at times as the principal therapy. Methods such as relaxation techniques (ie, yoga, hypnosis, and music), manual techniques (ie, massage, reflexology, and shiatsu), acupuncture, birthing ball, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation are considered safe, although the evidence supporting their effectiveness for pain relief is not as robust as it is for pharmacologic agents. Systemic pharmacologic agents are mostly administered by inhalation (nitrous oxide) or through the parenteral route. These agents include opioids such as meperidine, nalbuphine, tramadol, butorphanol, morphine, and remifentanil, and non-opioid agents such as parenteral acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Systemic pharmacologic agents suggest a diverse armamentarium of medication for pain management during labor. Their efficacy in treating pain associated with labor varies, and some continue to be used even though they have not been proven effective for pain relief. In addition, the maternal and perinatal side effects differ markedly among these agents. There is a relative abundance of data regarding the effectiveness of analgesic drugs compared with epidural, but the data regarding comparisons among the different types of alternative analgesic agents are scarce, and there is no consistency regarding the drug of choice for women who do not receive epidural pain management. This review aims to present the available data regarding the effectiveness of the different methods of relieving pain during labor other than epidural. The data presented are mainly based on recent level I evidence regarding pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods for pain relief during labor.",0
Treatment preferences in relation to fatigue of patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis: A discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment decisions for multiple sclerosis (MS) are influenced by many factors such as disease symptoms, comorbidities, and tolerability. OBJECTIVE: To determine how much relapsing MS patients were willing to accept the worsening of certain aspects of their MS in return for improvements in symptoms or treatment convenience. METHODS: A web-based discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in patients with relapsing MS. Multinomial logit models were used to estimate relative attribute importance (RAI) and to quantify attribute trade-offs. RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 817 participants from the US, the UK, Poland, and Russia. The most valued attributes of MS therapy to participants were effects on physical fatigue (RAI = 22.3%), cognitive fatigue (RAI = 22.0%), relapses over 2 years (RAI = 20.7%), and MS progression (RAI = 18.4%). Participants would accept six additional relapses in 2 years and a decrease of 7 years in time to disease progression to improve either cognitive or physical fatigue from ""quite a bit of difficulty"" to ""no difficulty."" CONCLUSION: Patients strongly valued improving cognitive and physical fatigue and were willing to accept additional relapses or a shorter time to disease progression to have less fatigue. The impact of fatigue on MS patients' quality of life should be considered in treatment decisions.",1
Obesity Management in Adults: A Review.,"IMPORTANCE: Obesity affects approximately 42% of US adults and is associated with increased rates of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, sleep disorders, osteoarthritis, and premature death. OBSERVATIONS: A body mass index (BMI) of 25 or greater is commonly used to define overweight, and a BMI of 30 or greater to define obesity, with lower thresholds for Asian populations (BMI ≥25-27.5), although use of BMI alone is not recommended to determine individual risk. Individuals with obesity have higher rates of incident cardiovascular disease. In men with a BMI of 30 to 39, cardiovascular event rates are 20.21 per 1000 person-years compared with 13.72 per 1000 person-years in men with a normal BMI. In women with a BMI of 30 to 39.9, cardiovascular event rates are 9.97 per 1000 person-years compared with 6.37 per 1000 person-years in women with a normal BMI. Among people with obesity, 5% to 10% weight loss improves systolic blood pressure by about 3 mm Hg for those with hypertension, and may decrease hemoglobin A1c by 0.6% to 1% for those with type 2 diabetes. Evidence-based obesity treatment includes interventions addressing 5 major categories: behavioral interventions, nutrition, physical activity, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic/bariatric procedures. Comprehensive obesity care plans combine appropriate interventions for individual patients. Multicomponent behavioral interventions, ideally consisting of at least 14 sessions in 6 months to promote lifestyle changes, including components such as weight self-monitoring, dietary and physical activity counseling, and problem solving, often produce 5% to 10% weight loss, although weight regain occurs in 25% or more of participants at 2-year follow-up. Effective nutritional approaches focus on reducing total caloric intake and dietary strategies based on patient preferences. Physical activity without calorie reduction typically causes less weight loss (2-3 kg) but is important for weight-loss maintenance. Commonly prescribed medications such as antidepressants (eg, mirtazapine, amitriptyline) and antihyperglycemics such as glyburide or insulin cause weight gain, and clinicians should review and consider alternatives. Antiobesity medications are recommended for nonpregnant patients with obesity or overweight and weight-related comorbidities in conjunction with lifestyle modifications. Six medications are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for long-term use: glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 (GLP-1) agonists (semaglutide and liraglutide only), tirzepatide (a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/GLP-1 agonist), phentermine-topiramate, naltrexone-bupropion, and orlistat. Of these, tirzepatide has the greatest effect, with mean weight loss of 21% at 72 weeks. Endoscopic procedures (ie, intragastric balloon and endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty) can attain 10% to 13% weight loss at 6 months. Weight loss from metabolic and bariatric surgeries (ie, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) ranges from 25% to 30% at 12 months. Maintaining long-term weight loss is difficult, and clinical guidelines support the use of long-term antiobesity medications when weight maintenance is inadequate with lifestyle interventions alone. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Obesity affects approximately 42% of adults in the US. Behavioral interventions can attain approximately 5% to 10% weight loss, GLP-1 agonists and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/GLP-1 receptor agonists can attain approximately 8% to 21% weight loss, and bariatric surgery can attain approximately 25% to 30% weight loss. Comprehensive, evidence-based obesity treatment combines behavioral interventions, nutrition, physical activity, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic/bariatric procedures as appropriate for individual patients.",0
A Smartphone-Gamified Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy Augmented With Biofeedback for Ailurophobia: Development and Evaluation Study.,"BACKGROUND: To the best of our knowledge, no specialized research has been conducted to address ailurophobia (fear of cats) in Iran or globally. This has driven our project, along with the prevalence of ailurophobia and the absence of a gamified virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) that incorporates affordable and easily accessible biofeedback (BF) tools. We hypothesize that a gamified VRET augmented with BF will yield more positive effects than a similar device lacking BF. OBJECTIVE: This study primarily focuses on the development and preliminary evaluation of a smartphone-gamified VRET integrated with BF, targeting animal phobia, with a specific case study on ailurophobia. The secondary objectives are using affordable and readily available BF found in devices such as smart bands and smartwatches and creating a mobile virtual reality gamified app to improve patients' adherence to treatments while simultaneously enhancing the app's accessibility, scalability, and outreach. METHODS: Evaluations encompassed 3 methods. First, we identified the tool's potential positive effects on phobia interventions, exploring 4 effects: intrinsic motivation, simulation of fearful situations, management of stressful circumstances without therapists' presence and mitigation of catastrophic thoughts, and preliminary effects on ailurophobia treatment. Participants were divided into BF and non-BF groups. Second, we gathered user preferences and opinions about the treatment. Third, we conducted heuristic evaluations using 44 heuristics from existing system usability scales assessing user interfaces, virtual reality platforms, and video games' playability. To interpret the data, mean scores; ANOVA, single factor; and ANOVA, 2-factor with replication were used. A total of 29 individuals were identified, of which 10 met the eligibility criteria or were accessible. RESULTS: The smartphone-gamified VRET augmented with BF exhibited better results on the identified effects compared with the non-BF version and contributed to normalizing encounters with cats. Moreover, 41 of the 44 heuristics achieved a percentage above 62%, indicating its potential as a therapeutic product and its ability to enhance patient adherence to treatments. Patient preferences on the treatment and its strengths and weaknesses were provided for further improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The tool has the potential to evolve into a comprehensive solution by incorporating various types of cats and their behaviors, simulating environments in which they are commonly found, and enhancing its appeal through an increased sense of adventure without inducing unrealistic fears. By adapting fear elements, the game can be tailored to treat various animal phobias. Phobia-focused games should avoid action and combat scenarios to prevent reinforcement of fear responses. After rigorous evaluation, further exploration is required to provide remote use beyond clinical settings.",0
Patient and clinician perspectives on shared decision-making in infertility treatment: A qualitative study.,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the considerations and barriers to implementing shared decision-making (SDM) in infertility treatment among female infertility patients, their male spouses, and fertility clinicians. METHODS: Participants were recruited from a reproductive medicine hospital in China's Shandong Province using purposive sampling. One-on-one interviews were held with female infertility patients and their spouses. In addition, a focus group discussion was conducted with fertility clinicians. Data analysis was subjected to open, axial, and selective coding. RESULTS: Nineteen female infertility patients and 10 male spouses were interviewed one-on-one. Five clinicians participated in the focus group discussion. Most female patients wanted to participate in the decision-making process, and that spouses and fertility clinicians supported SDM. Furthermore, key barriers were identified from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders, including communication difficulties, psychological pressure on female patients, patient preferences, multiple treatment stages, male spousal participation, clinician-patient trust, and subjective patient factors. CONCLUSIONS/PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This study explored the considerations of and barriers to implementing SDM in infertility treatment. Key barriers were identified from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders. Based on the findings, clinicians should encourage patients and their spouses to actively participate in decision-making, and provide objective and realistic guidance.",0
Large-scale retrospective analysis of methodological factors affecting pregnancy rates after embryo transfer for in vitro fertilization.,"This study aimed to investigate the impact of methodological factors on pregnancy rates after embryo transfer (ET) for in vitro fertilization. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted between September 2020 and April 2022. A total of 2048 patients who underwent ultrasonography-guided first frozen embryo transfer (FET) or a fresh ET cycle due to infertility were included in the study. The effects of age, ET protocol (frozen or fresh), preimplantation genetic testing, number of embryos transferred (NET), and embryo fundus distance on pregnancy rate were investigated. The mean age of pregnant patients (31.51 ± 5.28) was significantly lower than that of non-pregnant patients (35.34 ± 6.39) (P < .001). Multiple regression analysis showed that women with lower age (P < .001), higher NET (P < .001), higher embryo fundus distance (P < .001), FET (P < .001), and preimplantation genetic testing (P = .012) had a significantly higher likelihood of pregnancy. Appropriate transfer depth, younger age, euploid embryo transfer, FET, and a higher NET can increase the likelihood of pregnancy. However, multiple factors must be considered when deciding the best protocol for a particular patient, including patient preference, costs and timing.",0
Patient Preferences for Pain Control After Mohs Micrographic Surgery: A Single-Center Discrete Choice Experiment.,"IMPORTANCE: Patient preferences for pain medications after Mohs micrographic surgery are important to understand and have not been fully studied. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient preferences for pain management with only over-the-counter medications (OTCs) or OTCs plus opioids after Mohs micrographic surgery given varying levels of theoretical pain and opioid addiction risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective discrete choice experiment was conducted in a single academic medical center from August 2021 to April 2022 among patients undergoing Mohs surgery and their accompanying support persons (≥18 years). A prospective survey was administered to all participants using the Conjointly platform. Data were analyzed from May 2022 to February 2023. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The primary outcome was the pain level at which half of the respondents chose OTCs plus opioids equally to only OTCs for pain management. This pain threshold was determined for varying opioid addiction risk profiles (low, 0%; low-moderate, 2%; moderate-high, 6%; high, 12%) and measured via a discrete choice experiment and linear interpolation of associated parameters (pain levels and risk of addiction). RESULTS: Of the 295 respondents (mean [SD] age, 64.6 [13.1] years; 174 [59%] were female; race and ethnicity were not considered) who completed the discrete choice experiment, 101 (34%) stated that they would never consider opioids for pain management regardless of the pain level experienced, and 147 (50%) expressed concern regarding possible opioid addiction. Across all scenarios, 224 respondents (76%) preferred only OTCs vs OTCs plus opioids after Mohs surgery for pain control. When the theoretical risk of addiction was low (0%), half of the respondents expressed a preference for OTCs plus opioids given pain levels of 6.5 on a 10-point scale (90% CI, 5.7-7.5). At higher opioid addiction risk profiles (2%, 6%, 12%), an equal preference for OTCs plus opioids and only OTCs was not achieved. In these scenarios, patients favored only OTCs despite experiencing high levels of pain. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this prospective discrete choice experiment indicate that the perceived risk of opioid addiction affects the patient's choice of pain medications after Mohs surgery. It is important to engage patients undergoing Mohs surgery in shared decision-making discussions to determine the optimal pain control plan for each individual. These findings may encourage future research on the risks associated with long-term opioid use after Mohs surgery.",1
Engaging psoriasis patients in adherence and outcomes to topical treatments: A summary from the Symposium 'Tailoring topical psoriasis treatments to patients' needs and expectations' of the 30(th) EADV Congress 2021.,"This article is based on a presentation given by authors at the Satellite Symposium titled 'Tailoring topical psoriasis treatments to patients' needs and expectations' held during the 30(th) European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress. During this session, the factors affecting adherence and outcomes to topical treatments were presented, with a particular focus on the patients' point of view. Psoriasis is not just a skin condition. Psoriasis can cause negative psychosocial effects, such as depression and anxiety. The risk of suicidality in patients with psoriasis is higher than in the background population. Psychosocial comorbidities can be prevented by patient involvement in psoriasis management and need to be treated in a multidisciplinary manner. Adherence may be the largest barrier to treatment success with topical therapies. Improvement in several areas of disease management may lead to benefits in treatment adherence and hence clinical benefit. There are several treatment-related factors for non-adherence, such as patient dissatisfaction, side effects, treatment regimen or the drug vehicle. Delivering comprehensive treatment information to the patient will help develop realistic objectives and expectations. Patients need to be involved in the selection of treatment strategies, as psoriasis patients have various preferences for their use of topical treatments. A shared decision-making with the patient has been shown to improve medication adherence and treatment success. Prescribing therapy in line with a patient preference for treatment vehicle and improving the communication between healthcare professionals and patients may be key factors to maximize adherence. The calcipotriol (CAL) and betamethasone dipropionate (BDP) cream, a novel formulation of the CAL/BDP fixed-dose combination based on Poly-Aphron Dispersion (PAD) Technology, is a topical treatment of mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis, including scalp psoriasis, that has high cosmetic acceptance and overall treatment satisfaction.",0
Listening to music during intranasal (es)ketamine therapy in patients with treatment-resistant depression correlates with better tolerability and reduced anxiety.,"BACKGROUND: Although the effectiveness of (es)ketamine for therapy-resistant depression (TRD) has been established, potential treatment-limiting factors include side effects like dissociation, anxiety, or elevated blood pressure. Music can reduce stress and negative emotions as anxiety. This study aimed to investigate the impact of listening to music during intranasal (es)ketamine administration on both tolerability and efficacy. METHODS: Records of 494 sessions (of 37 patients) with intranasal (es)ketamine administration, each containing data of blood pressure measurements, DSS-IV (dissociation symptoms scale-IV), anxiety and euphoria analogue scale, MADRS (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale) and BDI (Beck's Depression Inventory) were evaluated. RESULTS: The between-group analysis, comparing participants who listened to music with those who did not, revealed significant differences in the administered dose (p-value: 0.003, mean: 131.5 mg with music vs. 116.7 mg without music), scores on the DSS Item 1 (p-value: 0.005, mean: 3 points vs. 2.4 points), levels of anxiety (p-value: <0.001, mean: 0.4 points vs. 1.4 points), and measurements of maximal systolic blood pressure after administration (p-value: 0.017, mean: 137.9 mmHg vs. 140.3 mmHg). Listening to music had no impact on the MARDS-change score between the sessions. LIMITATIONS: Key limitations include a non-randomized naturalistic design and the non-standardized selection of music, which was based on individual patient preferences. CONCLUSION: Listening to music during intranasal (es)ketamine therapy appears to be linked to reduced anxiety and lower blood pressure, stable or increased dissociation levels, and improved tolerance for higher doses. These findings could potentially contribute to the optimization of (es)ketamine therapy, both in terms of treatment efficacy and managing side effects.",0
Monoclonal antibody or aspirin desensitization in NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD)?,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD) is a clinical syndrome characterized by nasal polyposis, asthma, and intolerance to aspirin/NSAID. It affects approximately 15% cases of severe asthma, 10% of nasal polyps and 9% of rhinosinusitis. N-ERD results in associated asthma exacerbations, oral corticosteroids bursts, corticosteroid-dependent disease, and multiple endoscopic sinus surgeries. Unknown influences cause polyp epithelium to release alarmins, such as IL-33 and TSLP. These cytokines activate lymphoid cells, both Th2 and ILC2, to release cytokines such as IL5, IL4 and IL13, resulting in complex type 2 inflammation involving mast cells, eosinophils and platelets. Arachidonic acid released from such cells is metabolized into mediators. N-ERD is characterized by an imbalance in eicosanoid levels, especially CysLTs, PDG and PGE2. Patients with N-ERD present nasal symptoms (congestion, hyposmia/anosmia, nasal discharge) and lower airways symptoms (cough, sneezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness), anosmia, severe hyposmia as well as severe asthma which impacts the quality of life in this disease and leads to safety concerns in patients daily lives. Despite the variety of treatment strategies, the likelihood of recurrence of symptoms is high in patients with N-ERD. The most important strategies for treating N-ERD are listed as following: drug therapies, aspirin desensitization, monoclonal antibodies and other therapies associated. N-ERD treatment remains a major challenge in the current situation. Selecting the appropriate patient for aspirin desensitization, monoclonal antibodies or both is essential. This review provides an overview on aspirin desensitization and biologics in N-ERD and might help in decision making from both the perspective of the physician and patient. Patient characteristics, safety, efficacy, health care costs, but also patient preferences are all factors to take into account when it comes to a choice between biologics or aspirin desensitization.",0
Patient-centered care in von Willebrand disease: are we there yet?,"INTRODUCTION: Von Willebrand Disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. Paradoxically, affected individuals are often misdiagnosed and experience substantial diagnostic delay. There are sex-specific health disparities in VWD rooted in the stigmatization of vaginal bleeding, which leads to symptom dismissal, lack of timely access to care and lower health-related quality of life. AREAS COVERED: Following the core elements of patient-centered care - respect for patient preferences, values, and needs, we describe the current state of VWD care. Challenges of diagnostic delay, serial misrecognition of abnormal bleeding, and symptom dismissal are barriers that disproportionately affect women with VWD. These negative effects are further amplified in individuals living in low- and middle-income countries. We describe the importance of coordinated multidisciplinary care, as well as the need for patient education and empowered self-advocacy. EXPERT OPINION: While tremendous work has been done to improve the diagnosis and management of VWD, timely and high-quality research is urgently needed to address care gaps. Systemic changes such as resource investment, dedicated research funding for novel treatment modalities, and effective knowledge translation strategies to address structural barriers are needed to facilitate effective patient-centered care for VWD.",0
Exploration of patients' preference for modalities of care among peritoneal dialysis patients in Singapore: a single-center experience.,"INTRODUCTION: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is home-based dialysis therapy and therefore a suitable modality for kidney failure patients, particularly, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study examined patients' preferences for different PD-related services. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey study. Anonymized data from PD patients followed up at a single center in Singapore were collected using an online platform. The study focused on telehealth services, home visits, and monitoring of quality-of-life (QoL). RESULTS: A total of 78 PD patients responded to the survey. The majority of participants were Chinese (76%), married (73%), and between 45 and 65 years old (45%). The in-person visit was preferred over teleconsultation for consultation with nephrologists (68% versus 32%), counseling for kidney disease and dialysis by renal coordinators (59%), whereas the telehealth service was favored over in-person visit for dietary counseling (60%) and medication counseling (64%). Most participants (81%) preferred medication delivery over self-collection, and the acceptable turnaround time was 1 week. Sixty percent would like to have a regular home visit, but 23% refused such visits. The preferred frequency of home visits was one-to-three visits within the first 6 months (74%) and then 6 monthly for subsequent visits (40%). The majority of participants (87%) agreed with QoL monitoring, and the preferred frequency of monitoring varied between 6 monthly (45%) and yearly (40%). Participants also indicated three key areas in research to improve QoL, such as the development of artificial kidneys, portable PD devices, and simplification of PD procedure. Participants also would like to see improvement in two main areas of PD services, such as delivery service for PD solutions and social (instrumental, informational, and emotional) support. CONCLUSIONS: Most PD patients preferred in-person visits with nephrologists or renal coordinators; however, they favored telehealth services with dieticians and pharmacists. PD patients also welcomed home visit service and QoL monitoring. Future studies should confirm these findings.",0
Preferences for Treatments for Major Depressive Disorder: Formative Qualitative Research Using the Patient Experience.,"OBJECTIVES: The goals of this formative research are to elicit attributes of treatment and desired outcomes that are important to individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD), to develop a stated preference instrument, and to pre-test the instrument. METHODS: A three-phase survey study design elicited the patient's journey with MDD to design and pre-test the discrete choice experiment (DCE) instrument. Participants were 20 adults aged ≥ 18 with MDD who did not also have bipolar disorder or post-partum depression. We engaged patient advocates and a multi-disciplinary stakeholder advisory group to select and refine attributes for inclusion in a DCE instrument. The DCE was incorporated into a survey that also collected depression treatment and management and sociodemographic characteristics. The DCE was pre-tested with ten adults with MDD. RESULTS: Six attributes were included in the DCE: mode of treatment (medicine only, psychotherapy only, all modalities including brain stimulation), time to treatment effect (6, 9, 12 weeks), days of hopefulness (2, 4, 6 days/week), effect on productivity (40%, 60%, 90% increase), relations with others (strained, improved, no impact), and out-of-pocket costs ($30, $60, $90/month). The DCE test led to the refinement of mode of treatment (medicine, medicine and psychotherapy, and all modalities); time to treatment effect (4, 6, 9 weeks); monthly out-of-pocket costs ($30, $90, $270). CONCLUSIONS: MDD treatment preferences revealed trade-offs among mode of treatment, time to treatment effect, functional outcomes, and cost. The findings demonstrate the potential for meaningfully incorporating the patient experience in preference measures.",1
Patient Preferences in Short-Interval Staged Bilateral Rotator Cuff Repair.,"The decision to seek and undergo treatment for bilateral rotator cuff tears is often complex. The purpose of this study was to investigate patient preferences for undergoing short-interval staged bilateral rotator cuff repair; timing of surgeries; and order of surgeries. A retrospective analysis was performed for patients who underwent bilateral arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs within 12 months at a single institution. Postoperative patient-reported outcomes, satisfaction, and decision-making factors were collected via REDCap surveys. Ninety patients were included (63 men and 27 women; mean age, 58.1 years). The mean time between surgeries was 7.33 months. Forty-two percent of patients had left rotator cuff repair first. Patients reported a mean satisfaction score of 91.6 of 100 with the order of the surgeries and 87.3 of 100 with the timing of the surgeries. Mean postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons standardized assessment scores were 94.6 and 93.7 (left vs right shoulder first, respectively) for left shoulders and 94.2 and 93.9 (left vs right shoulder first, respectively) for right shoulders. Mean postoperative Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation scores were 86.5 and 83.9 (left vs right shoulder first, respectively) for left shoulders and 87.3 and 86.0 (left vs right shoulder first, respectively) for right shoulders. Decision-making factors noted as highly important included night pain, function, surgeon recommendation, and daily pain. Most patients who undergo short-interval staged bilateral rotator cuff repair are satisfied with the order and timing of their surgery. Decision-making factors such as night pain and functional limitation play a key role in the timing and order of bilateral rotator cuff repairs. [Orthopedics. 2023;46(6):e347-e352.].",0
"""If Not Me, Then Who?"": Exploring the Challenges Experienced by Front-Line Clinicians Screening for, and Communicating About, Domestic Violence in the Emergency Department.","Screening for domestic violence in healthcare settings increases detection. The emergency department (ED) is one setting where victims frequently attend with injuries and illnesses sustained from violence. However, screening rates remain suboptimal. There is little research about how formal screening occurs, or how less structured interactions are negotiated within the ED context. This article explores this important, but non-mandatory procedure within the context of clinician-patient interactions in Australia. A descriptive qualitative study was undertaken with 21 clinicians across seven EDs in Australia. Thematic analysis was undertaken by two researchers. Results indicate a lack of confidence around DV screening, and tensions in clinicians initiating conversation while managing their own emotional stressors. No participants expressed knowledge of formal screening processes in their workplaces. Successful DV screening programs must provide clinicians with the tools to minimize perceived discomfort in initiating and sustaining conversations while accepting patient preferences regarding disclosure.",0
Pressure-garment therapy for preventing hypertrophic scarring after burn injury.,"BACKGROUND: Burn damage to skin often results in scarring; however in some individuals the failure of normal wound-healing processes results in excessive scar tissue formation, termed 'hypertrophic scarring'. The most commonly used method for the prevention and treatment of hypertrophic scarring is pressure-garment therapy (PGT). PGT is considered standard care globally; however, there is continued uncertainty around its effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of pressure-garment therapy for the prevention of hypertrophic scarring after burn injury. SEARCH METHODS: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trials registers on 8 June 2023 with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PGT (alone or in combination with other scar-management therapies) with scar management therapies not including PGT, or comparing different PGT pressures or different types of PGT. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion using predetermined inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 1 tool. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included 15 studies in this review (1179 participants), 14 of which (1057 participants) presented useable data. The sample size of included studies ranged from 17 to 159 participants. Most studies included both adults and children. Eight studies compared a pressure garment (with or without another scar management therapy) with scar management therapy alone, five studies compared the same pressure garment at a higher pressure versus a lower pressure, and two studies compared two different types of pressure garments. Studies used a variety of pressure garments (e.g. in-house manufactured or a commercial brand). Types of scar management therapies included were lanolin massage, topical silicone gel, silicone sheet/dressing, and heparin sodium ointment. Meta-analysis was not possible as there was significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies. Main outcome measures were scar improvement assessed using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) or the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) (or both), pain, pruritus, quality of life, adverse events, and adherence to therapy. Studies additionally reported a further 14 outcomes, mostly individual scar parameters, some of which contributed to global scores on the VSS or POSAS. The amount of evidence for each individual outcome was limited. Most studies had a short follow-up, which may have affected results as the full effect of any therapy on scar healing may not be seen until around 18 months. PGT versus no treatment/lanolin We included five studies (378 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on whether PGT improves scars as assessed by the VSS compared with no treatment/lanolin. The evidence is also very uncertain for pain, pruritus, adverse events, and adherence. No study used the POSAS or assessed quality of life. One additional study (122 participants) did not report useable data. PGT versus silicone We included three studies (359 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of PGT compared with silicone, as assessed by the VSS and POSAS. The evidence is also very uncertain for pain, pruritus, quality of life, adverse events, adherence, and other scar parameters. It is possible that silicone may result in fewer adverse events or better adherence compared with PGT but this was also based on very low-certainty evidence. PGT plus silicone versus no treatment/lanolin We included two studies (200 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on whether PGT plus silicone improves scars as assessed by the VSS compared with no treatment/lanolin. The evidence is also very uncertain for pain, pruritus, and adverse events. No study used the POSAS or assessed quality of life or adherence. PGT plus silicone versus silicone We included three studies (359 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of PGT plus silicone compared with silicone, as assessed by the VSS and POSAS. The evidence is also very uncertain for pain, pruritus, quality of life, adverse events, and adherence. PGT plus scar management therapy including silicone versus scar management therapy including silicone We included one study (88 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of PGT plus scar management therapy including silicone versus scar management therapy including silicone, as assessed by the VSS and POSAS. The evidence is also very uncertain for pain, pruritus, quality of life, adverse events, and adherence. High-pressure versus low-pressure garments We included five studies (262 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of high pressure versus low pressure PGT on adverse events and adherence. No study used the VSS or the POSAS or assessed pain, pruritus, or quality of life. Different types of PGT (Caroskin Tricot + an adhesive silicone gel sheet versus Gecko Nanoplast (silicone gel bandage)) We included one study (60 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the effect of Caroskin Tricot versus Gecko Nanoplast on the POSAS, pain, pruritus, and adverse events. The study did not use the VSS or assess quality of life or adherence. Different types of pressure garments (Jobst versus Tubigrip) We included one study (110 participants). The evidence is very uncertain on the adherence to either Jobst or Tubigrip. This study did not report any other outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to recommend using either PGT or an alternative for preventing hypertrophic scarring after burn injury. PGT is already commonly used in practice and it is possible that continuing to do so may provide some benefit to some people. However, until more evidence becomes available, it may be appropriate to allow patient preference to guide therapy.",0
Building an implementation framework to address unmet contraceptive care needs in a carceral setting: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: The provision of contraceptive care for incarcerated individuals has been largely inconsistent and has contributed to, at best, inadequate care, and at worst reproductive abuses, violence, and coercion. While previous research has identified strategies to remedy known issues, to date, very few recommendations have been implemented across the carceral system. To address this, we conducted a systematic review of policy and practice recommendations to improve contraceptive care to reproductive-aged, incarcerated individuals in the United States. METHODS: We conducted this systematic review utilizing the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and framed it within the National Implementation Research Network's (NIRN) Exploration stage. We searched PubMed, PSYCInfo, SCOPUS, ProQuest, Web of Science, MedLine, Social Science Citation Index and reference sections of included materials. Basic study information, explicitly stated policy and practice recommendations, and discussions and conclusions that subtly provide recommendations were extracted in full text. We utilized a thematic analysis approach to analyze the extracted text. RESULTS: A total of 45 materials met the inclusion criteria. Seven overarching themes were identified: 1) policy changes needed to implement care; 2) need for contraceptive care in carceral systems; 3) justice agency barriers regarding contraceptive care provision; 4) policy barriers to contraceptive access; 5) funding strategies to improve care; 6) patient preferences for contraceptive care delivery; and 7) healthcare provider knowledge regarding contraceptive care. The seven themes identified shed light on the need for, gaps, barriers, and facilitators of current contraceptive care provision to incarcerated individuals. CONCLUSION: This systematic review accomplished two goals of NIRN's Exploration stage. First, the compiled evidence identified a clear need for change regarding policies and practices pertaining to contraceptive care provision to incarcerated individuals in the United States. Second, our findings identified several evidence-based solutions supported both by research and professional healthcare organizations to address the identified need for change. This study provides an initial blueprint for correctional agencies to implement the necessary changes for improving contraceptive care provision to incarcerated populations. The correctional system is in a unique position to deliver much-needed care, which would result in many potential benefits to the individuals, correctional system, and community at large.",0
Patient and Healthcare Professional Preferences for Prescription Weight Loss Medications in Australia: Two Discrete Choice Experiments.,"PURPOSE: Overweight and obesity are common in Australia and among the leading risk factors for ill health. Maintained weight loss of >5-10% can prevent and reduce the risk of obesity-related comorbidities. Prescription weight loss medications plus lifestyle interventions can result in additional weight loss compared with lifestyle interventions alone, but these medications are under-prescribed in Australia. Our aim was to develop a greater understanding of the treatment preferences of people with overweight or obesity and the healthcare practitioners (HCPs) who treat them. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: An online survey of Australian adults with overweight or obesity and treating HCPs was conducted in 2020. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) approach was used to determine what is most important to people when evaluating oral and injectable prescription weight loss medications. Participants were asked to choose between three hypothetical treatment alternatives: ""Oral pill""; ""Subcutaneous injection pen (replaceable needle)""; ""Disposable subcutaneous injection pen (hidden needle)""; and an opt-out option (""None of these""). RESULTS: The online survey and DCE were completed by 193 patients and 104 HCPs. For both patients and HCPs, all treatment alternatives (oral, replaceable injection and disposable injection) were preferred over the opt-out. Gastrointestinal side effects, followed by success rate, percentage body weight lost, and cost were the most important attributes to patients. For HCPs, percentage body weight loss was the most important treatment attribute, followed by success rate, gastrointestinal side effects and cost. While most patients reported relatively low needle fear, physicians reported relatively high perceived patient needle fear. CONCLUSION: Clinician-patient discussions about treatments for weight loss should cover the option of prescription weight loss medications, including injectable medications, which patients may be less apprehensive about than physicians believe. Treatments with a high success rate and low or manageable risk of gastrointestinal side effects may be preferred over alternatives.",1
Patient Preferences in Diagnostic Imaging: A Scoping Review.,"BACKGROUND: As new diagnostic imaging technologies are adopted, decisions surrounding diagnostic imaging become increasingly complex. As such, understanding patient preferences in imaging decision making is imperative. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to review quantitative patient preference studies in imaging-related decision making, including characteristics of the literature and the quality of the evidence. METHODS: The Pubmed, Embase, EconLit, and CINAHL databases were searched to identify studies involving diagnostic imaging and quantitative patient preference measures from January 2000 to June 2022. Study characteristics that were extracted included the preference elicitation method, disease focus, and sample size. We employed the PREFS (Purpose, Respondents, Explanation, Findings, Significance) checklist as our quality assessment tool. RESULTS: A total of 54 articles were included. The following methods were used to elicit preferences: conjoint analysis/discrete choice experiment methods (n = 27), contingent valuation (n = 16), time trade-off (n = 4), best-worst scaling (n = 3), multicriteria decision analysis (n = 3), and a standard gamble approach (n = 1). Half of the studies were published after 2016 (52%, 28/54). The most common scenario (n = 39) for eliciting patient preferences was cancer screening. Computed tomography, the most frequently studied imaging modality, was included in 20 studies, and sample sizes ranged from 30 to 3469 participants (mean 552). The mean PREFS score was 3.5 (standard deviation 0.8) for the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights that a variety of quantitative preference methods are being used, as diagnostic imaging technologies continue to evolve. While the number of preference studies in diagnostic imaging has increased with time, most examine preventative care/screening, leaving a gap in knowledge regarding imaging for disease characterization and management.",1
Patient preferences for treatment modalities for localised prostate cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the patient preferences and utility scores for the different conventional and innovative treatment modalities for localised prostate cancer (PCa). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients treated for localised PCa and healthy volunteers were invited to fill out a treatment-outcome scenario questionnaire. Participants ranked six different treatments for localised PCa from most to least favourable, prior to information. In a next step, treatment procedures, toxicity, risk of biochemical recurrence and follow-up regimen were comprehensibly described for each of the six treatments (i.e. treatment-outcome scenarios), after which patients re-ranked the six treatments. Additionally, participants gave a visual analogue scale (VAS) and time trade-off (TTO) score for each scenario. Differences between utility scores were tested by Friedman tests with post hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Eighty patients and twenty-nine healthy volunteers were included in the study. Before receiving treatment-outcome scenario information, participants ranked magnetic resonance-guided adaptive radiotherapy most often as their first choice (35%). After treatment information was received, active surveillance was most often ranked as the first choice (41%). Utility scores were significantly different between the six treatment-outcome scenarios, and active surveillance, non- and minimal-invasive treatments received higher scores. CONCLUSIONS: Active surveillance and non-invasive treatment for localised PCa were the most preferred options by PCa patients and healthy volunteers and received among the highest utility scores. Treatment preferences change after treatment information is received.",1
Patients' Views on AI for Risk Prediction in Shared Decision-Making for Knee Replacement Surgery: Qualitative Interview Study.,"BACKGROUND: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making around knee replacement surgery is increasing, and this technology holds promise to improve the prediction of patient outcomes. Ambiguity surrounds the definition of AI, and there are mixed views on its application in clinical settings. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to explore the understanding and attitudes of patients who underwent knee replacement surgery regarding AI in the context of risk prediction for shared clinical decision-making. METHODS: This qualitative study involved patients who underwent knee replacement surgery at a tertiary referral center for joint replacement surgery. The participants were selected based on their age and sex. Semistructured interviews explored the participants' understanding of AI and their opinions on its use in shared clinical decision-making. Data collection and reflexive thematic analyses were conducted concurrently. Recruitment continued until thematic saturation was achieved. RESULTS: Thematic saturation was achieved with 19 interviews and confirmed with 1 additional interview, resulting in 20 participants being interviewed (female participants: n=11, 55%; male participants: n=9, 45%; median age: 66 years). A total of 11 (55%) participants had a substantial postoperative complication. Three themes captured the participants' understanding of AI and their perceptions of its use in shared clinical decision-making. The theme Expectations captured the participants' views of themselves as individuals with the right to self-determination as they sought therapeutic solutions tailored to their circumstances, needs, and desires, including whether to use AI at all. The theme Empowerment highlighted the potential of AI to enable patients to develop realistic expectations and equip them with personalized risk information to discuss in shared decision-making conversations with the surgeon. The theme Partnership captured the importance of symbiosis between AI and clinicians because AI has varied levels of interpretability and understanding of human emotions and empathy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent knee replacement surgery in this study had varied levels of familiarity with AI and diverse conceptualizations of its definitions and capabilities. Educating patients about AI through nontechnical explanations and illustrative scenarios could help inform their decision to use it for risk prediction in the shared decision-making process with their surgeon. These findings could be used in the process of developing a questionnaire to ascertain the views of patients undergoing knee replacement surgery on the acceptability of AI in shared clinical decision-making. Future work could investigate the accuracy of this patient group's understanding of AI, beyond their familiarity with it, and how this influences their acceptance of its use. Surgeons may play a key role in finding a place for AI in the clinical setting as the uptake of this technology in health care continues to grow.",0
The work of Chinese chronic conditions: adaptation and validation of the Distribution of Co-Care Activities Scale.,"PURPOSE: The Distribution of Co-Care Activities Scale was adapted into Chinese for the purposes of this study, and then the psychometric characteristics of the Chinese version of the DoCCA scale were confirmed in chronic conditions. METHODS: A total of 434 patients with chronic diseases were recruited from three Chinese cities. A cross-cultural adaptation procedure was used to translate the Distribution of Co-Care Activities Scale into Chinese. Cronbach's alpha coefficient, split-half reliability, and test-retest reliability were used to verify the scale's reliability. Content validity indices, exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis were used to confirm the scale's validity. RESULTS: The Chinese DoCCA scale includes five domains: demands, unnecessary tasks, role clarity, needs support, and goal orientation. The S-CVI was 0.964. Exploratory factor analysis yielded a five-factor structure that explained 74.952% of the total variance. According to the confirmatory factor analysis results, the fit indices were within the range of the reference values. Convergent and discriminant validity both met the criteria. Also, the scale's Cronbach's alpha coefficient is 0.936, and the five dimensions' values range from 0.818 to 0.909. The split-half reliability was 0.848, and the test-retest reliability was 0.832. CONCLUSIONS: The Chinese version of the Distribution of Co-Care Activities Scale had high levels of validity and reliability for chronic conditions. The scale can assess how patients with chronic diseases feel about their service of care and provide data to optimize their personalized chronic disease self-management strategies.",0
Racial and Ethnic Differences in Medication Initiation Among Adults Newly Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes.,"OBJECTIVE: Given persistent racial/ethnic differences in type 2 diabetes outcomes and the lasting benefits conferred by early glycemic control, we examined racial/ethnic differences in diabetes medication initiation during the year following diagnosis. METHODS: Among adults newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (2005-2016), we examined how glucose-lowering medication initiation differed by race/ethnicity during the year following diagnosis. We specified modified Poisson regression models to estimate the association between race/ethnicity and medication initiation in the entire cohort and within subpopulations defined by HbA1c, BMI, age at diagnosis, comorbidity, and neighborhood deprivation index (a census tract-level socioeconomic indicator). RESULTS: Among the 77,199 newly diagnosed individuals, 47% started a diabetes medication within 12 months of diagnosis. The prevalence of medication initiation ranged from 32% among Chinese individuals to 58% among individuals of Other/Unknown races/ethnicities. Compared to White individuals, medication initiation was less likely among Chinese (relative risk: 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.72, 0.84)) and Japanese (0.82 (0.75, 0.90)) individuals, but was more likely among Hispanic/Latinx (1.27 (1.24, 1.30)), African American (1.14 (1.11, 1.17)), other Asian (1.13 (1.08, 1.18)), South Asian (1.10 (1.04, 1.17)), Other/Unknown (1.31 (1.24, 1.39)), American Indian or Alaska Native (1.11 (1.04, 1.18)), and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (1.28 (1.19, 1.37)) individuals. Racial/ethnic differences dissipated among individuals with higher HbA1c values. CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of glucose-lowering treatment during the year following type 2 diabetes diagnosis differed markedly by race/ethnicity, particularly for those with lower HbA1c values. Future research should examine how patient preferences, provider implicit bias, and shared decision-making contribute to these early treatment differences.",0

"People With Diabetes and Caregivers Prefer Rescue Glucagon Treatment With a Wider Storage Temperature Range and a Nasal Administration, When Efficacy is Similar: A Discrete Choice Experiment in Spain.","BACKGROUND: Conventional injectable glucagon (IG) and nasal glucagon (NG), both having similar efficacy, are two options for the emergency treatment of severe hypoglycemia in Spain. This study elicited the effect of changes in key attributes on preferences for NG and IG medication profiles of people with diabetes and caregivers in Spain. METHODS: The relative attribute importance (RAI) that participants placed on glucagon preparation, preparation and administration time, delivery method, recovery time, device size, storage temperature, and headache risk was estimated from an online discrete choice experiment. In addition, patients and caregivers were presented with NG and IG profiles that included rates of successful administration; the proportion of participants choosing each profile was summarized. RESULTS: The analysis included 276 adults with diabetes (65% type 1) and 270 caregivers (49% type 1). Overall mean age was 40 years; 51% were female. The most important attributes were storage temperature (RAI [95% confidence interval] = 27.3% [22.9-32.2]) and delivery method (17.4% [13.1-21.9]). Headache risk (16.2% [11.8-20.7]), time to prepare and administer (14.5% [10.1-18.8]), glucagon preparation (11.4% [6.8-15.8]), recovery time (8.9% [4.3-13.3]), and device size (4.3% [0.3-8.8]) were also relevant. When comparing medication profiles, significantly more participants (78%) preferred NG over IG profiles (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Adults with diabetes and caregivers prefer a glucagon treatment with a higher rate of successful administration, wider storage temperature, and nasal delivery method, when efficacy is similar. Participants favored NG over conventional IG as a rescue medication for severe hypoglycemia. This information may help decision-making by payers and treatment discussions between health care professionals and patients.",1
"Advancements in Varicose Vein Treatment: Anatomy, Pathophysiology, Minimally Invasive Techniques, Sclerotherapy, Patient Satisfaction, and Future Directions.","Varicose veins are a common vascular condition known for causing discomfort and cosmetic concerns. This comprehensive narrative review delves into their anatomy, pathophysiology, and modern treatment options, with a focus on endovenous techniques and sclerotherapy. The review starts by emphasizing the intricate anatomy of lower extremity venous circulation, underlining the significance of both superficial and deep venous networks in venous return. It also addresses how changes in the venous wall, including valvular insufficiency, contribute to the development of varicose veins. Endovenous techniques like endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA) are explored in detail. These minimally invasive procedures have revolutionized varicose vein treatment, offering high success rates and quicker recovery compared to traditional surgery. The review also highlights their efficacy and safety profiles, aiding clinicians in informed decision-making. Sclerotherapy, a vital modality for varicose veins, is thoroughly examined, covering both liquid and foam sclerotherapy. Foam sclerotherapy, in particular, is recognized for its improved outcomes. The review provides a comprehensive comparison of these treatment modalities, highlighting differences in technical success, recurrence rates, and cost-effectiveness. Patient preferences and satisfaction play a significant role in choosing the right treatment. Safety and potential complications associated with these treatments are explored, with a focus on minor issues and rare adverse events. This review also emphasizes the positive impact of varicose vein interventions on patients' quality of life.",0
New biologics for food allergy.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to explore role of emerging biologics, including ligelizumab, UB-221, dupilumab, and antialarmins, in food allergy management. With a focus on recent developments, we evaluate their promise in mitigating adverse events during oral immunotherapy (OIT), reducing allergic reactions, and addressing the limitations of current therapeutic options. RECENT FINDINGS: Antiimmunoglobulin E mAbs, exemplified by omalizumab, demonstrate efficacy in desensitization and safety improvement during multiallergen OIT. Next-generation antibodies like ligelizumab and UB-221 exhibit enhanced potency and unique mechanisms, holding promise for food allergy treatment. Dupilumab, targeting IL-4 receptor alpha, presents potential benefits in decreasing allergen-specific IgE and modifying the atopic march. Exploration of antialarmins, specifically anti-IL-33 (etokimab) and anti-TSLP (tezepelumab), reveals encouraging results, with etokimab showing early success in peanut allergy trials. SUMMARY: Biologics hold promising potential for food allergy treatment. Tailoring therapeutic approaches based on shared decision-making becomes pivotal. While omalizumab remains a significant option, next-generation anti-IgE antibodies and agents targeting alarmins exhibit unique strengths. Dupilumab, despite limited success as monotherapy, shows promise as an adjunct for OIT. Careful consideration of treatment goals, patient preferences, and the evolving landscape of biologics will shape future clinical practice, offering allergists an expanded toolbox for personalized food allergy management.",0
Adaptation of the WOMAC for Use in a Patient Preference Study.,"OBJECTIVES: To adapt a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure, the Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), into efficacy attributes for a discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey designed to quantify the relative importance of endpoints commonly used in knee osteoarthritis (KOA) trials. METHODS: The adaptation comprised four steps: (1) selecting domains of interest; (2) determining presentation and framing of selected attributes; (3) determining attribute levels; and (4) developing choice tasks. This process involved input from multiple stakeholders, including regulators, health preference researchers, and patients. Pretesting was conducted to evaluate if patients comprehended the adapted survey attributes and could make trade-offs among them. RESULTS: The WOMAC pain and function domains were selected for adaption to two efficacy attributes. Two versions of the discrete choice experiment (DCE) instrument were created to compare efficacy using (1) total domain scores and (2) item scores for ""walking on a flat surface."" Both attributes were presented as improvement from baseline scores by levels of 0%, 30%, 50%, and 100%. Twenty-six participants were interviewed in a pretest of the instrument (average age 60 years; 58% female; 62% had KOA for ≥ 5 years). The participants found both versions of attributes meaningful and relevant for treatment decision-making. They demonstrated willingness and ability to tradeoff improvements in pain and function separately, though many perceived them as inter-related. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the growing literature regarding adapting PRO measures for patient preference studies. Such adaptation is important for designing a preference study that can incorporate a clinical trial's outcomes with PRO endpoints.",1
An Electronic Shared Decision-Making App to Improve Asthma Outcomes: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making (SDM) incorporates patient values and preferences to optimize asthma management decisions. Available asthma SDM aids primarily focus on medication selection. OBJECTIVE: To assess the usability, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of an electronic SDM application, the ACTION (Active Conversation in asthma Treatment shared decisION-making) app, that addressed medication, nonmedication, and COVID-19 concerns for asthma. METHODS: In this pilot study, 81 participants with asthma were randomized into the control arm or ACTION app intervention. The ACTION app was completed 1 week before a clinic visit, and responses were shared with the medical provider. The primary outcomes were patient satisfaction and SDM quality. Next, ACTION app users (n = 9) and providers (n = 5) provided feedback through separate virtual focus groups. Sessions were coded by comparative analysis. RESULTS: The ACTION app group scored higher agreement that providers adequately addressed COVID-19 concerns compared with the control group (4.4 vs 3.7, P = .03). Although the ACTION app group had a higher total 9-item Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire score, this did not reach statistical significance (87.1 vs 83.3, P = .2). However, the ACTION app group demonstrated stronger agreement that their physician knew exactly how they wanted to be involved in decision-making (4.3 vs 3.8, P = .05), providers asked about preferences (4.3 vs 3.8, P = .05), and that different options were thoroughly weighed (4.3 vs 3.8, P = .03). Major focus group themes included that the ACTION app was practical and established a patient-centered agenda. CONCLUSION: An electronic asthma SDM app that incorporates patient preferences regarding nonmedication-related, medication-related, and COVID-19-related concerns is well accepted and can improve patient satisfaction and SDM.",0
In-Hospital Code Status Updates: Trends Over Time and the Impact of COVID-19.,"OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to evaluate if the percentage of patients with missing or inaccurate code status documentation at a Trauma Level 1 hospital could be reduced through daily updates. The secondary objective was to examine if patient preferences for DNR changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective study, spanning March 2019 to December 2022, compared the code status in ICU and ED patients drawn from two data sets. The first was based on historical electronic medical records (EHR), and the second involved daily updates of code status following patient admission. RESULTS: Implementing daily updates upon admission was more effective in ICUs than in the ED in reducing missing code status documentation. Around 20% of patients without a specific code status chose DNR under the new system. During COVID-19, a decrease in ICU patients choosing DNR and an increase in full code (FC) choices were observed. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of regular updates and discussions regarding code status to enhance patient care and resource allocation in ICU and ED settings. The COVID-19 pandemic's influence on shifting patient preferences towards full code status underscores the need for adaptable documentation practices. Emphasizing patient education about DNR implications and benefits is key to supporting informed decisions that reflect individual health contexts and values. This approach will help balance the considerations for DNR and full code choices, especially during health care crises.",0
Effectiveness of a peer educator-coordinated preference-based differentiated service delivery model on viral suppression among young people living with HIV in Lesotho: The PEBRA cluster-randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: Southern and Eastern Africa is home to more than 2.1 million young people aged 15 to 24 years living with HIV. As compared with other age groups, this population group has poorer outcomes along the HIV care cascade. Young people living with HIV and the research team co-created the PEBRA (Peer Educator-Based Refill of ART) care model. In PEBRA, a peer educator (PE) delivered services as per regularly assessed patient preferences for medication pick-up, short message service (SMS) notifications, and psychosocial support. The cluster-randomized trial compared PEBRA model versus standard clinic care (no PE and ART refill done by nurses) in 3 districts in Lesotho. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Individuals taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) aged 15 to 24 years at 20 clinics (clusters) were eligible. In the 10 clinics randomized to the intervention arm, participants were offered the PEBRA model, coordinated by a trained PE and supported by an eHealth application (PEBRApp). In the 10 control clusters, participants received standard nurse-coordinated care without any service coordination by a PE. The primary endpoint was 12-month viral suppression below 20 copies/mL. Analyses were intention-to-treat and adjusted for sex. From November 6, 2019 to February 4, 2020, we enrolled 307 individuals (150 intervention, 157 control; 218 [71%] female, median age 19 years [interquartile range, IQR, 17 to 22]). At 12 months, 99 of 150 (66%) participants in the intervention versus 95 of 157 (61%) participants in the control arm had viral suppression (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.79 to 2.03]; p = 0.327); 4 of 150 (2.7%) versus 1 of 157 (0.6%) had died (adjusted OR 4.12; 95% CI [0.45 to 37.62]; p = 0.210); and 12 of 150 (8%) versus 23 of 157 (14.7%) had transferred out (adjusted OR 0.53; 95% CI [0.25 to 1.13]; p = 0.099). There were no significant differences between arms in other secondary outcomes. Twenty participants (11 in intervention and 9 in control) were lost to follow-up over the entire study period. The main limitation was that the data collectors in the control clusters were also young peers; however, they used a restricted version of the PEBRApp to collect data and thus were not able to provide the PEBRA model. The trial was prospectively registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03969030). CONCLUSIONS: Preference-based peer-coordinated care for young people living with HIV, compared to nurse-based care only, did not lead to conclusive evidence for an effect on viral suppression. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03969030, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03969030.",0
Prevalence and Correlates of Preference-Concordant Care Among Hospitalized People Receiving Maintenance Dialysis.,"KEY POINTS: A large proportion of hospitalized patients receiving dialysis report not receiving preference-concordant care. Hospitalized patients on dialysis desiring a comfort-oriented medical plan were likely to report receiving preference-concordant care. BACKGROUND: Preference-concordant care is a cornerstone of high-quality medical decision-making, yet the prevalence and correlates of preference-concordant care have not been well-studied in patients receiving dialysis. We surveyed hospitalized people receiving maintenance dialysis to estimate the prevalence and correlates of preference-concordant care among this population. METHODS: We assessed preference concordance by asking participants (223/380, 59% response rate), “How strongly do you agree or disagree that your current treatment plan meets your preference?” We assessed treatment plan preference by asking whether patients preferred a plan that focused on (1) extending life or (2) relieving pain and discomfort. We assessed shared dialysis decision-making using the 9-item Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire. We examined the differences between those reporting lack of preference-concordant care and those reporting receipt of preference-concordant care using chi-squared analyses. We also studied whether patients' treatment plan preferences or shared dialysis decision-making scores were correlated with their likelihood of receiving preference-concordant care. RESULTS: Of the 213 respondents who provided data on preference concordance, 90 (42.3%) reported that they were not receiving preference-concordant care. Patients who preferred pain and discomfort relief over life extension were less likely (odds ratio, 0.15 [95% confidence interval, 0.08 to 0.28] P = <0.0001) to report receiving preference-concordant care; patients with higher shared decision-making scores were more likely (odds ratio, 1.02 [95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.03], P = 0.02) to report preference-concordant care. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of this sample of hospitalized people receiving maintenance dialysis reported not receiving preference-concordant care. Efforts to improve symptom management and enhance patient engagement in dialysis decision-making may improve the patients' perceptions of receiving preference-concordant care.",0

Primary and Specialist Palliative Care in Neurosurgery: A Narrative Review and Bibliometric Analysis of Glioblastoma and Stroke.,"OBJECTIVE: Due to the increased demand for palliative care (PC) in recent years, a model has been proposed to divide PC into primary PC and specialist PC. This article aimed to delineate the indications for primary and specialist PC within 2 common neurosurgical conditions-glioblastoma (GBM) and stroke. METHODS: A systematic review and bibliometric analysis was conducted to better appreciate the practice trends in PC utilization for GBM and stroke patients using several databases. RESULTS: There were 70 studies on PC for GBM, the majority of which related to patient preference (22 [31%]). During 1999-2022, there was significant growth in publications per year on this topic at a rate of approximately 0.3 publications per year (P < 0.01). There were 44 studies on PC for stroke, the majority of which related to communication strategies (14 [32%]). During 1999-2022, there was no significant growth in stroke publications per year (P = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: Due to the progressively disabling neurological course of GBM, we suggest that a specialty PC team be used in conjunction with the neurosurgical team early in the disease trajectory while patients are still able to communicate their preferences, goals, and values. In contrast, short-term and long-term stages of management of stroke have differing implications for PC needs, with the short-term stage necessitating adept, time-sensitive communication between the patient, family, and care teams. Thus, we propose that primary PC should be included as a core competency in neurosurgery training, among other stroke specialists.",0
Nonpharmacologic and Pharmacologic Treatments of Adults in the Acute Phase of Major Depressive Disorder: A Living Clinical Guideline From the American College of Physicians.,"DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this guideline from the American College of Physicians (ACP) is to present updated clinical recommendations on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions as initial and second-line treatments during the acute phase of a major depressive disorder (MDD) episode, based on the best available evidence on the comparative benefits and harms, consideration of patient values and preferences, and cost. METHODS: The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on an updated systematic review of the evidence. AUDIENCE AND PATIENT POPULATION: The audience for this guideline includes clinicians caring for adult patients in the acute phase of MDD in ambulatory care. The patient population includes adults in the acute phase of MDD. RECOMMENDATION 1A: ACP recommends monotherapy with either cognitive behavioral therapy or a second-generation antidepressant as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder (strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence). RECOMMENDATION 1B: ACP suggests combination therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy and a second-generation antidepressant as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The informed decision on the options of monotherapy with cognitive behavioral therapy versus second-generation antidepressants or combination therapy should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences. RECOMMENDATION 2: ACP suggests monotherapy with cognitive behavioral therapy as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of mild major depressive disorder (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). RECOMMENDATION 3: ACP suggests one of the following options for patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder who did not respond to initial treatment with an adequate dose of a second-generation antidepressant: • Switching to or augmenting with cognitive behavioral therapy (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence) • Switching to a different second-generation antidepressant or augmenting with a second pharmacologic treatment (see Clinical Considerations) (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence) The informed decision on the options should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences.",0
The Rhytidectomy Scar: Analysis of Patient and Surgeon Perspectives.,"An understanding of patient preference is vital for surgeons to create outcomes that align with the goals of patients undergoing cosmetic surgery. This study analyzes the perception of the rhytidectomy scar from the perspective of cosmetic patients and surgeons. Cross-sectional surveys were administered in-person to cosmetic patients and online to facial plastic and reconstructive surgeons in the United States. Participants were presented with standardized lateral view photographs of preauricular scars for 10 patients at least 12 months post rhytidectomy procedure. A variety of rhytidectomy incisions were chosen to include pre- versus post-tragal incisions, blunted hair tuft, hypopigmentation, narrow versus wide scar healing. Participants were asked to rate the outcome of the preauricular rhytidectomy scar using the Likert scale from 1 to 10. Quantitative analysis indicates that while both surgeons and cosmetic patients viewed hypopigmented scars less favorably, surgeons were more concerned with pre-tragal incision and blunted hair tuft. Furthermore, the number of rhytidectomies performed by surgeons resulted in more critical analysis of the scars presented in this study. Qualitative analysis of the frequent use of ""natural"" in the patient comments suggests the importance of maintaining a sense of ""normalcy"" as well. In contrast, the surgeon comments are most frequently about the relationship between the scar and surrounding anatomical structures, suggesting a descriptive focus on the technicality of scar placement and subsequent anatomical result. Cosmetic patients are primarily concerned about scar appearance while surgeons are more focused on the technical orientation of the scar. An understanding and comparison of the language and perceptions of surgeons and cosmetic patients regarding rhytidectomy scars are vital in creating aesthetic results and managing patient expectations.",0
Ethics of the algorithmic prediction of goal of care preferences: from theory to practice.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are quickly gaining ground in healthcare and clinical decision-making. However, it is still unclear in what way AI can or should support decision-making that is based on incapacitated patients' values and goals of care, which often requires input from clinicians and loved ones. Although the use of algorithms to predict patients' most likely preferred treatment has been discussed in the medical ethics literature, no example has been realised in clinical practice. This is due, arguably, to the lack of a structured approach to the epistemological, ethical and pragmatic challenges arising from the design and use of such algorithms. The present paper offers a new perspective on the problem by suggesting that preference predicting AIs be viewed as sociotechnical systems with distinctive life-cycles. We explore how both known and novel challenges map onto the different stages of development, highlighting interdisciplinary strategies for their resolution.",0
Effects of an interactive web-based support system via mobile phone on preference-based patient participation in patients living with hypertension - a randomized controlled trial in primary care.,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effects of an interactive web-based support system via mobile phone on preference-based patient participation in patients with hypertension treated in primary care (compared with standard hypertensive care only). DESIGN: A parallel group, non-blinded, randomized controlled trial, conducted October 2018-February 2021. Besides standard hypertensive care, the intervention group received eight weeks of support via mobile phone to facilitate self-monitoring and self-management, tentatively providing for augmented patient engagement. SETTING: 31 primary healthcare centers in Sweden. SUBJECTS: 949 patients treated for hypertension. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The effects on preference-based patient participation, that is, the match between a patient's preferences for and experiences of patient participation in their health and healthcare. This was measured with the 4Ps (Patient Preferences for Patient Participation) tool at baseline, after 8 weeks, and at 12 months. Data were registered electronically and analyzed with multilevel ordinal regression. RESULTS: At baseline, 43-51% had a complete match between their preferences for and experiences of patient participation. There was an indication of a positive effect by a higher match for 'managing treatment myself' at 8-weeks in the intervention group. Such preference-based participation in their health and healthcare was reversed at 12 months, and no further effects of the intervention on preference-based patient participation persisted after 12 months. CONCLUSION: The interactive web-based support system via mobile phone had a wavering effect on preference-based patient participation. There is a prevailing need to better understand how person-centered patient participation can be facilitated in primary care.",0
Cost effectiveness of using trastuzumab biosimilars compared to trastuzumab original drugs to treat breast cancer in a hospital setting.,"INTRODUCTION: Subcutaneous (SC) drug administration, such as the Herceptin® in an oncology day hospital reduces the administration time of trastuzumab. In the context of combination therapy administration, this time-saving may be called into question. The challenge posed by the deployment of much less expensive IV biosimilar forms raises questions about the cost-effectiveness of SC administration. METHODS: Using data from a french Diagnostic Related Groups regarding prescriptions of intravenous Herceptin® (HIV), Herceptin® biosimilar IV (BSIV), and Herceptin® subcutaneous (HSC), we conducted two simulations. This simulation involved replacing all HSC with BSIV in combination therapy administration (Simulation 1) and subsequently substituting IV forms with SC forms only when prescribed as monotherapy (Simulation 2). A cost-benefit analysis was conducted based on these two simulations, from the hospital's perspective, for Normandy's population over a 1-year timeframe. RESULTS: In Simulation 1, there was an average cost-saving of €12 per patient per year, but it resulted in a loss of 10140 min, equivalent to 10 min per patient per year when compared to the current situation. Simulation 2 yielded average cost-savings for the hospital amounting to €51 per patient per year, along with a time-saving of 67 min per patient per year compared to the current situation. CONCLUSIONS: The development of a program aimed at optimizing the prescription of Trastuzumab holds the potential to deliver significant cost-savings to hospitals while enhancing the quality of service provided to the patients. This optimization involves using H SC in monotherapy and BS IV in combination therapy administration.",0
Implementing Shared Decision-Making for Multiple Sclerosis: The MS-SUPPORT Tool.,"BACKGROUND: Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) offer opportunities to improve the course of multiple sclerosis (MS), but decisions about treatment are difficult. People with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) want more involvement in decisions about DMTs, but new approaches are needed to support shared decision-making (SDM) because of the number of treatment options and the range of outcomes affected by treatment. We designed a patient-centered tool, MS-SUPPORT, to facilitate SDM for pwMS. We sought to evaluate the feasibility and impact of MS-SUPPORT on decisions about disease modifying treatments (DMTs), SDM processes, and quality-of-life. METHODS: This multisite randomized controlled trial compared the SDM intervention (MS-SUPPORT) to control (usual care) over a 12-month period. English-speaking adults with relapsing MS were eligible if they had an upcoming MS appointment and an email address. To evaluate clinician perspectives, participants' MS clinicians were invited to participate. Patients were referred between November 11, 2019 and October 23, 2020 by their MS clinician or a patient advocacy organization (the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America). MS-SUPPORT is an online, interactive, evidence-based decision aid that was co-created with pwMS. It clarifies patient treatment goals and values and provides tailored information about MS, DMTs, and adherence. Viewed by patients before their clinic appointment, MS-SUPPORT generates a personalized summary of the patient's treatment goals and preferences, adherence, DMT use, and clinical situation to share with their MS clinician. Outcomes (DMT utilization, adherence, quality-of-life, and SDM) were assessed at enrollment, post-MS-SUPPORT, post-appointment, and quarterly for 1 year. RESULTS: Participants included 501 adults with MS from across the USA (84.6% female, 83% white) and 34 of their MS clinicians (47% neurologists, 41% Nurse Practitioners, 12% Physician Assistants). Among the 203 patients who completed MS-SUPPORT, most (88.2%) reported they would recommend it to others and that it helped them talk to their doctor (85.2%), understand their options (82.3%) and the importance of taking DMTs as prescribed (82.3%). Among non-users of DMTs at baseline, the probability ratio of current DMT use consistently trended higher over one-year follow-up in the MS-SUPPORT group (1.30 [0.86-1.96]), as did the cumulative probability of starting a DMT within 6-months, with shorter time-to-start (46 vs 90 days, p=0.24). Among the 222 responses from 34 participating clinicians, more clinicians in the MS-SUPPORT group (vs control) trended towards recommending their patient start a DMT (9 of 108 (8%) vs 5 of 109 (5%), respectively, p=0.26). Adherence (no missed doses) to daily-dosed DMTs was higher in the MS-SUPPORT group (81.25% vs 56.41%, p=.026). Fewer patients forgot their doses (p=.046). The MS-SUPPORT group (vs control) reported 1.7 fewer days/month of poor mental health (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: MS-SUPPORT was strongly endorsed by patients and is feasible to use in clinical settings. MS-SUPPORT increased the short-term probability of taking and adhering to a DMT, and improved long-term mental health. Study limitations include selection bias, response bias, social desirability bias, and recall bias. Exploring approaches to reinforcement and monitoring its implementation in real-world settings should provide further insights into the value and utility of this new SDM tool.",0
Efficacy of Telehealth for Movement-Evoked Pain in People With Chronic Achilles Tendinopathy: A Noninferiority Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of physical therapy delivered via an all telehealth or hybrid format with an all in-person format on movement-evoked pain for individuals with chronic Achilles tendinopathy (AT). METHODS: Sixty-six individuals with chronic AT participated (age, 43.4 [SD = 15.4] years; 56% female; body mass index, 29.9 [SD = 7.7] kg/m2). Participants completed all in-person visits from the initiation of recruitment in September 2019 to March 16, 2020 (in-person group). From March 17 to July 15, 2020, participants completed all telehealth visits (telehealth group). From July 16, 2020, to enrollment completion in December 2020, participants could complete visits all in-person, all telehealth, or a combination of in-person and telehealth (hybrid group) based on their preference. A physical therapist provided 6 to 7 visits, including an exercise program and patient education. Noninferiority analyses of the telehealth and hybrid groups compared with the in-person group were completed for the primary outcome of movement-evoked pain during single-limb heel raises. RESULTS: All groups demonstrated decreases in movement-evoked pain beyond the minimal clinically important difference from baseline to 8 weeks (2 out of 10 on a numeric pain rating scale). Lower bounds of the 95% CIs for mean differences between groups did not surpass the preestablished noninferiority margin (2 out of 10) for movement-evoked pain in both the telehealth and hybrid groups (telehealth vs in-person: 0.45 [-1.1 to 2.0]; hybrid vs in-person: 0.48 [-1.0 to 1.9]). CONCLUSION: Individuals with chronic AT who completed a tendon-loading program with patient education through a telehealth or hybrid format had no worse outcomes for pain than those who received the same intervention through in-person visits. IMPACT: Physical therapist-directed patient care delivered via telehealth may enhance accessibility to best practice AT rehabilitation, including exercise and education. Use of telehealth technology may also provide an opportunity to prioritize patient preference for physical therapy visit format. LAY SUMMARY: If you are a patient with chronic AT, physical therapist-directed patient care delivered via telehealth may improve your accessibility to best practice AT rehabilitation, including exercise and education. Use of telehealth technology may also prioritize your preferences regarding the format of the physical therapy visit.",0

"Patient preferences do matter: a discrete choice experiment conducted with breast cancer patients in six European countries, with latent class analysis.","OBJECTIVES: The evolution of breast cancer (BC) treatments has resulted in tailored therapies for the different types and stages of BC. Each treatment has a profile of benefits and adverse effects which are taken into consideration when planning a treatment pathway. This study examines whether patients' preferences are in line with what is considered important from decision makers viewpoint. METHODS: An online discrete choice experiment was conducted in six European countries (France, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Spain, UK) with BC patients. Six attributes were included: overall survival (OS), hyperglycemia, rash, pain, functional well-being (FWB), and out-of-pocket payment (OOP). Sixteen choice sets with two hypothetical treatments and a ""No treatment"" option were presented. Data were analyzed with the use of heteroscedastic conditional, mixed logistic, and latent class models. Marginal rate of substitution (MRS) were estimated for OOP versus the rest of attributes to establish the ranking of preferences for each attribute. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-seven patients with advanced or metastatic BC and 314 with early-stage BC responded. Forty-nine percent of patients were < 44 years old and 65 percent had completed university education. The MRS of the analysis demonstrated that ""severe pain"" is the highest dis-preferred attribute level, followed by ""severe impairment in FWB"" and OS. Four classes of patients as ""decision makers"" were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that there is heterogeneity in treatment preferences of BC patients depending on their sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics. In combination with clinical guidelines, patient preferences can support the selection and tailoring of treatment options.",1
Stakeholder Engagement in Designing Attributes for a Discrete Choice Experiment With Policy Implications: An Example of 2 Swiss Studies on Healthcare Delivery.,"OBJECTIVES: The use of discrete choice experiments (DCEs) has become increasingly popular in health policy development by involving and analyzing the preferences of target groups for different aspects of the policy intervention. In this article, we aim to contribute to the standardization of the process of attribute and attribute level development for DCEs with policy relevance. To do so, we propose and empirically illustrate a framework tool for the development and reporting of attributes and attribute levels, with the systematic engagement of relevant stakeholders. METHODS: The framework tool was kept general to allow its use as a standard reporting approach on the development process of a DCE, involving relevant stakeholders at each stage. The proposed 3-stage process consists of (1) collection, (2) selection, and (3) refinement of the DCE attributes and attribute levels. The application of the framework tool is illustrated by 2 projects, Health2040 and COCONUTS-both concerning the preferences of the Swiss population for the future organization of healthcare. RESULTS: By engaging stakeholders, we identified and included attributes and attribute levels that would not have been identified solely through the existing literature. In addition, including multiple stakeholders from different professional backgrounds ensured that the selected attributes and attribute levels were policy relevant, were applicable in practice, and reflected the opinions of multiple actors in healthcare. CONCLUSION: The proposed framework helps to strengthen the standardization of the reporting on attribute and attribute level development with stakeholder engagement and to guide future research teams designing a DCE with policy implications.",1
Trajectories of primary health care utilization: a 10-year follow-up after the Swedish Patient Choice Reform of primary health care.,"BACKGROUND: In January 2010, the choice reform was instituted in Swedish primary health care establishing free entry for private primary health care providers and enabling patients to choose freely among primary health care centers. The motivation behind the reform was to improve access to primary care and responsiveness to patient expectations. Reform effects on health care utilization have previously been investigated by using subgroup analyses assuming a pattern of homogeneous subgroups of the population. By using a different methodological approach, the aim of this study was to, from an equity perspective, investigate long term trends of primary health care utilization following the choice reform. METHOD: A closed cohort was created based on register data from Region Skåne, the third most populated region in Sweden, describing individuals' health care utilization between 2007-2017. Using a novel approach, utilization data, measured as primary health care visits, was matched with socioeconomic and geographic determinants, and analyzed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 659,298 individuals were included in the cohort. Sex differences in utilization were recorded to decrease in the older age group and to increase in the younger age group. Multivariable logistic regression showed increasing utilization in older men to be associated with higher socioeconomic position, while in women it was associated with lower socioeconomic position. Furthermore, groups of becoming high utilizers were all associated with lower socioeconomic position and with residence in urban areas. CONCLUSION: The impact of demographic, socioeconomic and geographic determinants on primary health care utilization varies in magnitude and direction between groups of the population. As a result, the increase in utilization as observed in the general population following the choice reform is unevenly distributed between different population groups.",0

"Effective growth hormone replacement with once-weekly somapacitan in Japanese children with growth hormone deficiency: Results from REAL4, a phase 3 clinical trial.","OBJECTIVE: Somapacitan is a long-acting growth hormone (GH) derivative developed for the treatment of GH deficiency (GHD). This study evaluates the efficacy and tolerability of somapacitan in Japanese children with GHD after 104 weeks of treatment and after switch from daily GH. DESIGN: Subanalysis on Japanese patients from a randomised, open-labelled, controlled parallel-group phase 3 trial (REAL4, NCT03811535). PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Thirty treatment-naïve patients were randomised 2:1 to somapacitan (0.16 mg/kg/week) or daily GH (0.034 mg/kg/day) up to Week 52, after which all patients received somapacitan. Height velocity (HV; cm/year) at Weeks 52 and 104 were the primary measurements. Additional assessments included HV SD score (SDS), height SDS, bone age, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) SDS, and observer-reported outcomes. RESULTS: At Week 52, observed mean HV was similar between treatment groups (10.3 vs. 9.8 cm/year for somapacitan and daily GH, respectively). Similar HVs between groups were also observed at Week 104: 7.4 cm/year after continuous somapacitan treatment (soma/soma) and 7.9 cm/year after 1-year somapacitan treatment following switch from daily GH (switch). Other height-related endpoints supported continuous growth. IGF-I SDS increased in both groups with mean IGF-I SDS within -2 and +2 during the study. Somapacitan was well tolerated, one mild injection site reaction was reported, with no reports of injection site pain. Patient preference questionnaires showed that most patients and their caregivers (90.9%) who switched treatment at Week 52 preferred once-weekly somapacitan over daily GH treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Somapacitan showed sustained efficacy in Japanese children with GHD over 104 weeks and for 52 weeks after switching from daily GH. Somapacitan was well tolerated and preferred over daily GH.",0
Evaluation of pharmacist impact on diabetes outcomes for telehealth and hybrid care delivery versus in-office visits.,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the effect of pharmacist-led telemanagement on diabetes outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: Assess for noninferiority for the absolute change in mean A1C between telehealth and hybrid groups versus the in-office group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objectives were to compare the percentage of patients achieving population health A1C goals and patient no-show rates between study groups. METHODS: A retrospective, noninferiority analysis was conducted for patients seen by a primary care pharmacist from November 1, 2020 to May 31, 2021 across 17 primary care clinics in the Northeast Ohio region of Cleveland Clinic. The noninferiority margin was prespecified at > 0.3% A1C reduction. Patients with a baseline A1C of 8% or greater were included. Patients were separated into 3 study groups (telehealth, in-office, and hybrid) based on the visit types that were conducted by the pharmacist during the study period. RESULTS: Hybrid care delivery (N = 366) was noninferior to in-office care delivery (N = 180), with regards to absolute change in mean A1C reduction (0.24% [95% CI: -0.13, 0.61], P = 0.002). Similar results were shown when comparing the telehealth group (N = 691) to the in-office group (0.04 [95% CI: -0.28, 0.36], P = 0.02). The mean A1C reduction in the in-office (1.36 ± 1.9), hybrid (1.60 ± 2.2), and telehealth (1.40 ± 2.0) groups were not significantly different (P = 0.23). Subgroup analyses showed that newly consulted patients had a larger reduction in A1C compared to the overall population, in all groups. No-show rates and percentage of patients achieving population health A1C goals were not significantly different based on visit type. CONCLUSION: Telehealth and hybrid visit types were noninferior to in-office visits with regards to mean change in A1C reduction. Results demonstrate the importance of primary care pharmacists continuing to offer diverse visit types based on patient preference.",0
Factors associated with the effectiveness of immersive virtual therapy in alleviating depressive symptoms during sub-acute post-stroke rehabilitation: a gender comparison.,"BACKGROUND: The large-scale digitalization of healthcare has induced shifts in patient preferences, prompting the introduction of therapies utilizing novel technologies. In this context, the targeted application of these interventions is deemed as crucial as assessing their overall effectiveness. The aim of this study was to characterize the patient profile who benefited most from immersive virtual reality (VR) therapy. METHODS: Based on the results from the previous randomized controlled trial study, we employed an exploratory study design to determine the factors associated with the most significant mental health improvement. A secondary analysis was conducted on a sample of 83 participants, with further analysis of participants with elevated depression symptoms, as indicated by a score of > 10 on the 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-30). Both groups participated in a similar post-stroke rehabilitation program; however, the experimental group also received additional VR therapy through an immersive VR garden intervention. The GDS-30 was used to assess mood and depressive symptoms, and sociodemographic, cognitive status as well as stroke-related variables were considered as potential factors. RESULTS: In both the experimental (mean change 5.3) and control groups (mean change 2.8), interventions significantly reduced depressive symptoms, with a more pronounced difference in the experimental group (p < 0.05). When examining gender differences, women exhibited greater improvement in the GDS, with mean between-group differences of 5.0 for the total sample and 6.0 for those with elevated depressive symptoms. Sociodemographic factors, cognitive status, and time from stroke were not found to be factors that alter the effectiveness of VR therapy. CONCLUSIONS: While VR therapy as an adjunctive treatment for post-stroke rehabilitation seems especially effective for women with elevated depressive symptoms, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the study's small experimental group size. Traditional methods showed reduced effectiveness in women compared to men; thus, developing technologically advanced and gender-specific approaches can lead to more tailored therapy.

The Role of Nurse on the Treatment Decision Support for Older People with Cancer: A Systematic Review.,"Background: The number of older adults with cancer is increasing worldwide. The role of nurses in supporting patients' decision-making is expanding, as this process is fraught with complexity and uncertainty due to comorbidities, frailty, cognitive decline, etc., in older adults with cancer. The aim of this review was to examine the contemporary roles of oncology nurses in the treatment decision-making process in older adults with cancer. Methods: A systematic review of PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Results: Of the 3029 articles screened, 56 full texts were assessed for eligibility, and 13 were included in the review. We identified three themes regarding nurses' roles in the decision-making process for older adults with cancer: accurate geriatric assessments, provision of available information, and advocacy. Nurses conduct geriatric assessments to identify geriatric syndromes, provide appropriate information, elicit patient preferences, and communicate efficiently with patients and caregivers, promoting physicians. Time constraints were cited as a barrier to fulfilling nurses' roles. Conclusions: The role of nurses is to elicit patients' broader health and social care needs to facilitate patient-centered decision-making, respecting their preferences and values. Further research focusing on the role of nurses that considers diverse cancer types and healthcare systems is needed.",0
Impact of Locus of Control on Patient-Provider Communication: A Systematic Review.,"Growing evidence shows there is heterogeneity in patient communication preferences and a need to tailor communication approaches accordingly. However, little is known about the psychosocial factors that influence communication preferences. Among them is locus of control (LOC), a belief about who or what determines outcomes, including health. Although LOC theory was developed over 60 years ago as a personality theory, its relevance in healthcare has increased over the past two decades. There is a paucity of empirical evidence on patient or provider LOC as it influences communication quality and outcomes in healthcare settings. We conducted a systematic review to collate the current state of the literature.We carried out a comprehensive search of PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Library databases to retrieve relevant peer-reviewed articles. A total of 1152 publications were identified. Our final review included 17 articles that underwent data extraction and quality assessment.The included studies found evidence of LOC associations with several patient and provider communication-related outcomes including satisfaction with care; medical decision-making and communication preferences; adherence; and patient-provider rapport. As opposed to generalized approaches to communication, assessing patient LOC may allow clinicians to tailor their approaches to match patients' LOC. Our findings provide a starting point and highlight the need for future studies.",0
Quality of Life in Oncology: Measuring What Matters for Cancer Patients and Survivors in Europe: The EUonQol Project.,"Cancer, in Europe, is the second cause of death. In addition, there is an unacceptable variability in terms of access to innovation, quality of care, and outcomes, within and between countries. The European Union has activated an unprecedented initiative to fight cancer by launching Europe's Beating Cancer Plan and the Cancer Mission. The goals are to reduce mortality, increase survival, and ameliorate quality of life by increasing knowledge, improving quality of care, and reducing inequalities through interventions on actionable determinants of variability. A competitive call was launched with the objective to develop and validate a set of quality of life and patient preference measures for cancer patients and survivors, to be used for routine data collection all over Europe. A consortium, the EUonQoL, was funded, including partners from 41 countries with 55 participants. It will start the activities on January 2023 and rresults are expected by December 2024.",0
Multimodal prehabilitation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing anatomical resection: protocol of a non-randomised feasibility study.,"BACKGROUND: The preoperative period can be used to enhance a patient's functional capacity with multimodal prehabilitation and consequently improve and fasten postoperative recovery. Especially, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) surgical patients may benefit from this intervention, since the affected and resected organ is an essential part of the cardiorespiratory fitness. Drafting a prehabilitation programme is challenging, since many disciplines are involved, and time between diagnosis of NSCLC and surgery is limited. We designed a multimodal prehabilitation programme prior to NSCLC surgery and aimed to conduct a study to assess feasibility and indicative evidence of efficacy of this programme. Publication of this protocol may help other healthcare facilities to implement such a programme. METHODS: The multimodal prehabilitation programme consists of an exercise programme, nutritional support, psychological support, smoking cessation, patient empowerment and respiratory optimisation. In two Dutch teaching hospitals, 40 adult patients with proven or suspected NSCLC will be included. In a non-randomised fashion, 20 patients follow the multimodal prehabilitation programme, and 20 will be assessed in the control group, according to patient preference. Assessments will take place at four time points: baseline, the week before surgery, 6 weeks postoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. Feasibility and indicative evidence of efficacy of the prehabilitation programme will be assessed as primary outcomes. DISCUSSION: Since the time between diagnosis of NSCLC and surgery is limited, it is a challenge to implement a prehabilitation programme. This study will assess whether this is feasible, and evidence of efficacy can be found. The non-randomised fashion of the study might result in a selection and confounding bias. However, the control group may help putting the results of the prehabilitation group in perspective. By publishing this protocol, we aim to facilitate others to evaluate and implement a multimodal prehabilitation programme for surgical NSCLC patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The current study is registered as NL8080 in the Netherlands Trial Register on the 10th of October 2019, https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/8080 .

The effect of geographic origin and destination on congenital heart disease outcomes: a retrospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a common and significant birth defect, frequently requiring surgical intervention. For beneficiaries of the Department of Defense, a new diagnosis of CHD may occur while living at rural duty stations. Choice of tertiary care center becomes a function of geography, referring provider recommendations, and patient preference. METHODS: Using billing data from the Military Health System over a 5-year period, outcomes for beneficiaries age < 10 years undergoing CHD surgery were compared by patient origin (rural versus urban residence) and the distance to treatment (patient's home and the treating tertiary care center). These beneficiaries include children of active duty, activated reserves, and federally activated National Guard service members. Analysis of the outcomes were adjusted for procedure complexity risk. Treatment centers were further stratified by annual case volume and whether they publicly reported results in the society of thoracic surgery (STS) outcomes database. RESULTS: While increasing distance was associated with the cost of admission, there was no associated risk of inpatient mortality, one year mortality, or increased length of stay. Likewise, rural origination was not significantly associated with target outcomes. Patients traveled farther for STS-reporting centers (STS-pr), particularly high-volume centers. Such high-volume centers (> 50 high complexity cases annually) demonstrated decreased one year mortality, but increased cost and length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings contribute to the national conversation of rural community medicine versus regionalized subspecialty care; separation of patients between rural areas and more urban locations for initial CHD surgical care does not increase their mortality risk. In fact, traveling to high volume centers may have an associated mortality benefit.",0
Preferences for onward health data use in the electronic age among maternity patients and providers in South Africa: a qualitative study.,"Despite the expanding digitisation of individual health data, informed consent for the collection and use of health data is seldom explicitly sought in public sector clinics in South Africa. This study aims to identify perceptions of informed consent practices for health data capture, access, and use in Gauteng and the Western Cape provinces of South Africa. Data collection from September to December 2021 included in-depth interviews with healthcare providers (n = 12) and women (n = 62) attending maternity services. Study findings suggest that most patients were not aware that their data were being used for purposes beyond the individualised provision of medical care. Understanding the concept of anonymised use of electronic health data was at times challenging for patients who understood their data in the limited context of paper-based folders and booklets. When asked about preferences for electronic data, patients overwhelmingly were in favour of digitisation. They viewed electronic access to their health data as facilitating rapid and continuous access to health information. Patients were additionally asked about preferences, including delivery of health information, onward health data use, and recontacting. Understanding of these use cases varied and was often challenging to convey to participants who understood their health data in the context of information inputted into their paper folders. Future systems need to be established to collect informed consent for onward health data use. In light of perceived ties to the care received, these systems need to ensure that patient preferences do not impede the content nor quality of care received.",0
Engaging Men of Diverse Racial and Ethnic Groups With Advanced Prostate Cancer in the Design of an mHealth Diet and Exercise Intervention: Focus Group Study.,"BACKGROUND: Healthy diet and exercise can improve quality of life and prognosis among men with prostate cancer. Understanding the perceived barriers to lifestyle change and patient preferences in a diverse cohort of men with prostate cancer is necessary to inform mobile health (mHealth) lifestyle interventions and increase health equity. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a multisite study to understand the preferences, attitudes, and health behaviors related to diet and lifestyle in this patient population. This report focuses on the qualitative findings from 4 web-based focus groups comprising a racially and ethnically diverse group of patients with advanced prostate cancer who are on androgen deprivation therapy. METHODS: We used grounded theory analyses including open, axial, and selective coding to generate codes. Qualitative data were analyzed as a whole rather than by focus group to optimize data saturation and the transferability of results. We present codes and themes that emerged for lifestyle intervention design and provide recommendations and considerations for future mHealth intervention studies. RESULTS: Overall, 14 men participated in 4 racially and ethnically concordant focus groups (African American or Black: 3/14, 21%; Asian American: 3/14, 21%; Hispanic or Latino: 3/14, 21%; and White: 5/14, 36%). Analyses converged on 7 interwoven categories: context (home environment, access, competing priorities, and lifestyle programs), motivation (accountability, discordance, feeling supported, fear, and temptation), preparedness (health literacy, technological literacy, technological preferences, trust, readiness to change, identity, adaptability, and clinical characteristics), data-driven design (education, psychosocial factors, and quality of life), program mechanics (communication, materials, customization, and being holistic), habits (eg, dietary habits), and intervention impressions. These results suggest actionable pathways to increase program intuitiveness. Recommendations for future mHealth intervention design and implementation include but are not limited to assessment at the individual, household, and neighborhood levels to support a tailored intervention; prioritization of information to disseminate based on individuals' major concerns and the delivery of information based on health and technological literacy and communication preferences; prescribing a personalized intervention based on individuals' baseline responses, home and neighborhood environment, and support network; and incorporating strategies to foster engagement (eg, responsive and relevant feedback systems) to aid participant decision-making and behavior change. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing a patient's social context, motivation, and preparedness is necessary when tailoring a program to each patient's needs in all racial and ethnic groups. Addressing the patients' contexts and motivation and preparedness related to diet and exercise including the household, access (to food and exercise), competing priorities, health and technological literacy, readiness to change, and clinical characteristics will help to customize the intervention to the participant. These data support a tailored approach leveraging the identified components and their interrelationships to ensure that mHealth lifestyle interventions will engage and be effective in racially and ethnically diverse patients with cancer.

Patient perspectives on repeated contrast-enhanced mammography and magnetic resonance during neoadjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND: The burden perceived by the patient of repeated imaging required for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) monitoring warrants attention due to the increased use of NAC and imaging. PURPOSE: To evaluate and compare the experienced burden associated with repeated contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during NAC for breast cancer from the patient perspective. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Approval from the ethics committee and written informed consent were obtained. In this prospective study, CEM and MRI were performed on 38 patients with breast cancer before, during, and after NAC in a tertiary cancer center. The experienced burden was evaluated with a self-reported questionnaire addressing duration, comfort, anxiety, positioning, and intravenous contrast administration, each measured on a 5-point Likert scale. The participants were asked their preference between CEM or MRI. Statistical comparisons were performed and P<0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Most participants (n = 29, 76%) preferred CEM over MRI (P = 0.0008). CEM was associated with a significantly shorter duration (P < 0.001), greater overall comfort (P < 0.01), more comfortable positioning (P = 0.01), and lower anxiety (P = 0.03). Intravenous contrast administration perception revealed no significant difference. Only 4 (10%) participants preferred MRI over CEM, due to the absence of breast compression. CONCLUSION: In the hypothetical scenario of equal diagnostic accuracy, most participants preferred CEM and compared CEM favorably to MRI in all investigated features at repeated imaging required for NAC response assessment. Our results indicate that repeated examinations with CEM is well tolerated and constitutes a patient-friendly alternative for NAC imaging monitoring in breast cancer.",0
