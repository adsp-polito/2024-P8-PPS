Cancer Survivor Preferences for Models of Breast Cancer Follow-Up Care: Selecting Attributes for Inclusion in a Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It is critical to evaluate cancer survivors' preferences when developing follow-up care models to better address the needs of cancer survivors. This study was conducted to understand the key attributes of breast cancer follow-up care for use in a future discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey. METHODS: Key attributes of breast cancer follow-up care models were generated using a multi-stage, mixed-methods approach. Focus group discussions were conducted with cancer survivors and clinicians to generate a range of attributes of current and ideal follow-up care. These attributes were then prioritised using an online survey with survivors and healthcare providers. The DCE attributes and levels were finalised via an expert panel discussion based on the outcomes of the previous stages. RESULTS: Four focus groups were held, two with breast cancer survivors (n = 7) and two with clinicians (n = 8). Focus groups generated sixteen attributes deemed important for breast cancer follow-up care models. The prioritisation exercise was conducted with 20 participants (14 breast cancer survivors and 6 clinicians). Finally, the expert panel selected five attributes for a future DCE survey tool to elicit cancer survivors' preferences on breast cancer follow-up care. The final attributes included: the care team, allied health and supportive care, survivorship care planning, travel for appointments, and out-of-pocket costs. CONCLUSIONS: Attributes identified can be used in future DCE studies to elicit cancer survivors' preferences for breast cancer follow-up care. This strengthens the design and implementation of follow-up care programs that best suit the needs and expectations of breast cancer survivors.",1
Expert Consensus for the Use of Outpatient Rehabilitation Visits After Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Delphi Study.,"OBJECTIVE: There is no consensus for how to use rehabilitation visits after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We sought to develop expert recommendations for outpatient rehabilitation visit usage after TKA. DESIGN: Delphi study. METHODS: First, we developed a broad list of preliminary visit usage recommendations, which were specific to patients' recovery status (ie, slow, typical, or fast recovery) and time since surgery. We then invited 49 TKA experts to participate on a Delphi panel. During round 1, we surveyed panelists regarding their level of agreement with each preliminary recommendation. We conducted additional Delphi rounds as needed to build consensus, which we defined using the RAND/UCLA method. We updated the survey each round based on panelist feedback and responses from the previous round. RESULTS: Thirty panelists agreed to participate, and 29 panelists completed 2 Delphi rounds. The panel reached consensus on recommendations related to visit frequency, visit timing, and the use of telerehabilitation. The panel recommended that outpatient rehabilitation should begin within 1 week after surgery at a frequency of 2 times per week for the first postoperative month regardless of recovery status. The panel recommended different visit frequencies depending on the patient's recovery status for postoperative months 2 to 3. The panel agreed that telerehabilitation can be recommended for most patients after TKA, but not for patients recovering slowly. CONCLUSION: We used the Delphi process to develop expert recommendations for the use of outpatient rehabilitation visits after TKA. We envision these recommendations could help patients decide how to use visits based on their own preferences. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2023;53(9):1-9.

Factors that influence intensive care admission decisions for older people: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: The population worldwide is rapidly ageing, and demand for intensive care is increasing. People aged 85 years and above, known as the oldest old, are particularly vulnerable to critical illness owing to the physiological effects of ageing. Evidence surrounding admission of the oldest old to the intensive care is limited. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to systematically and comprehensively review and synthesise the published research investigating factors that influence decisions to admit the oldest old to the intensive care unit. METHOD: This was a systematic review and narrative synthesis. Following a comprehensive search of CINAHL, Embase, and Medline databases, peer-reviewed primary research articles examining factors associated with admission or refusal to admit the oldest old to intensive care were selected. Data were extracted into tables and narratively synthesised. RESULTS: Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Three studies identified factors associated with admission such as greater premorbid self-sufficiency, patient preferences, alignment between patient and physicians' goals of treatment, age less than 85 years, and absence of cancer, or previous intensive care admission. Factors associated with refusal to admit were identified in all six studies and included limited or no bed availability, level of ICU physician experience, patients being deemed too ill or too well to benefit, and older age. CONCLUSIONS: Published research investigating decision-making about admission or refusal to admit the oldest old to the intensive care unit is scant. The ageing population and increasing demand for intensive care unit resources has amplified the need for greater understanding of factors that influence decisions to admit or refuse admission of the oldest old to the intensive care unit. Such knowledge may inform guidelines regarding complex practice decisions about admission of the oldest old to an intensive care unit. Such guidelines would ensure the specialty needs of this population are considered and would reduce admission decisions that might disadvantage older people.",0
Prospective Patient Preferences for Humor in Urologists Treating Erectile Dysfunction: A Survey Study.,"INTRODUCTION: Men seeking treatment for sexual dysfunction can experience embarrassment as a result of stigma. This research manuscript presents the findings of a survey conducted to investigate the influence of humor on prospective patients' preferences when selecting a specialist to address erectile dysfunction (ED). METHODS: The respondents were presented with five pairs of mock urology business cards: one professional and one humorous. A questionnaire was designed and distributed via an online survey platform. Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 29 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY) to evaluate age and race associations with card preference. RESULTS: Among the 997 participants, an average of 66.1% (a median of 71.2%) preferred professional cards. Humorous card selection rates ranged from 5.2% to 38.4% compared to 54.0% to 78.1% for professional cards. A statistically significant relationship between age and professional card choice existed in all except the fifth set of cards (p = 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, and 0.054). The relationship between race or ethnicity and business card preference was not reported due to an imbalance in demographics, with most participants identifying as Caucasian. DISCUSSION: A humor-centric approach may not resonate with all individuals seeking treatment for sensitive conditions such as ED. Limitations include the subjectivity of humor, the use of an online survey platform, and the hypothetical nature of this study. Real patients experiencing ED may face stigma and respond to humor differently. CONCLUSION: This study provides insights into patient preference for professionalism over humor from their urologist but leaves room for the exploration of humor in medical contexts. Future studies could examine the impacts of humor on patient choices in real-world healthcare settings.",0
Effect of protocol-based family visitation on physiological indicators in ICU patients: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) patients often experience significant physiological stress. This study evaluated the effect of a defined family visitation protocol on physiological responses in the ICU. METHODS: A randomized, block-randomized clinical trial was conducted on 78 ICU patients at Imam Reza Hospital between February 8, 2017, and August 8, 2017. The intervention group received protocol-based visits, and the control group continued with standard visitation. Block randomization was utilized for group assignments. The primary outcome was the measurement of physiological signs using designated monitoring devices. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22, employing independent t-tests, Mann-Whitney U test, repeated measures analysis, and Friedman's test. RESULTS: The results showed no significant differences in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, and arterial blood oxygen levels between the two groups. However, heart rate in the intervention group was significantly lower in three stages before, during, and after the meaningful visiting (P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Protocol-based scheduled family visits in the ICU may reduce physiological stress, as evidenced by a decrease in patients' heart rate. Implementing tailored visitation protocols sensitive to patient preferences and clinical contexts is advisable, suggesting the integration of family visits into standard care practices for enhanced patient outcomes.

"""I want to stay here"": Patient and staff perspectives on transitioning from a low-threshold buprenorphine program to clinic-based care.","BACKGROUND: The Project Connections At Re-Entry (PCARE) Van is a low-threshold buprenorphine program operating outside the Baltimore City Detention Center. Like other low-threshold programs, PCARE seeks to engage a vulnerable population in care, stabilize patients, then transition patients to longer-term care; however, <10% of patients transition to clinic-based buprenorphine treatment. Our goal was to better understand these low transition rates and center patient perspectives in discussion of broader low-threshold program design. METHODS: From December 2022 to June 2023, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 former and current PCARE patients and 6 staff members. We used deductive and inductive coding followed by thematic content analysis to identify themes around treatment experiences and care preferences. RESULTS: There were strong preferences among current and former patients for continuing buprenorphine treatment at the PCARE Van. Several themes emerged from the data that explained patient preferences, including both advantages to continuing care at the van (preference for continuity, feeling respected by the program's structure and philosophy) and disadvantages to transitioning to a clinic (perceived harms associated with rigid or punitive care models). Staff noted limited program capacity, and patients expressed that if needed, they would transition to a clinic for altruistic reasons. Staff expressed varied perspectives on low-threshold care, emphasizing both larger systems factors, as well as beliefs about individual patient responsibility. CONCLUSIONS: While many low-threshold care settings are designed as transitional bridge models, this research highlights patient preference for long-term care at low-threshold programs and supports efforts to adapt low-threshold models to be sustainable as longitudinal care.",0
"A Prospective, Randomized Single-Blind Crossover Study Comparing High-Frequency 10,000 Hz and Burst Spinal Cord Stimulation.","OBJECTIVES: Although both high-frequency and burst spinal cord stimulation (SCS) have shown improved efficacy and patient satisfaction compared with conventional tonic stimulation, there are limited data directly comparing the two. This study aimed to compare both high-frequency 10,000 Hz and burst SCS in the same patients in terms of pain relief and satisfaction in those with axial back pain with or without leg pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted at an outpatient pain clinic within an academic medical center. Participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups in which they trialed either burst or high-frequency 10,000 Hz SCS over five days, followed by a 24- to 48-hour washout period with no stimulation, and the alternative therapy over the remaining four days. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were collected immediately before and after both therapy trials. Secondary end points included percentage change in VAS score and patient preference. RESULTS: Of 25 participants, those receiving burst followed by high-frequency SCS (n = 11) had a mean VAS difference of 4.73 after the first trial period and 2.86 after the second. Of those receiving high-frequency followed by burst SCS (n = 14), mean VAS difference after the first trial period was 4.00 and 1.93 after the second trial period. Four participants were withdrawn owing to lead migration. Both therapies showed statistically significant differences in pre- minus post-VAS scores and percent relief. There were no significant differences in carryover or treatment effects between the two groups. There was a statistically significant association between trial sequence and stimulator type implanted because the first stimulator trialed was more likely to be chosen. CONCLUSIONS: There were no observed differences in VAS pain score decrease when comparing burst and high-frequency 10,000 Hz SCS programming therapies. Patient preference followed an order effect, favoring the first programming therapy in the trial sequence.",0
Evaluation of patient participation in relation to the implementation of a person-centered nursing shift handover.,"BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that nursing shift-to-shift handover should be a more team-based dialogue with and for the patient rather than about a patient. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate patient participation in relation to the implementation of the person-centered handover (PCH). METHOD: A pretest-posttest design was used without a comparison group, including patients from nine units in a university hospital at pretest (n = 228) and after implementing PCH (posttest, n = 253) per the framework integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services. The PCH is inspired by an Australian bedside handover model. The Patient Preferences for the Patient Participation tool was used to rate the preference for and experience of participation on 12 items, combined into three levels of preference-based participation (insufficient-fair-sufficient). RESULTS: There were no differences regarding experience or preference-based participation between patients at pretest-posttest; however, posttest patients experienced participation in the item Reciprocal communication to a lesser extent than the pretest patients. Only 49% of the posttest group received PCH; of those not receiving PCH, some would have wanted PCH (27%), while some would have declined (24%). Patients receiving PCH had sufficient participation (82%), to a greater extent, regarding the item Sharing one's symptoms with staff than patients at pretest (72%). Patients receiving PCH also had sufficient participation, to a greater extent, than patients at posttest who did not receive, but would have wanted PCH, regarding four items: (1) sharing one's symptoms with staff, (2) reciprocal communication, (3) being told what was done, and (4) taking part in planning. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Most patients want to be present at PCH. Therefore, nurses should ask for the patients' preferences regarding PCH and act accordingly. Not inviting patients who want PCH could contribute to insufficient patient participation. Further studies are needed to capture what assistance nurses would want in identifying and acting in alignment with patient preferences.",0
Understanding Patient Preferences Regarding the Important Determinants of Breast Cancer Treatment: A Narrative Scoping Review.,"OBJECTIVE: Conventionally, optimal treatment strategies for breast cancer have been largely determined by physicians, with a scant understanding of patients' treatment values and preferences. Incorporating patient preferences in the decision-making process for breast cancer treatment is gaining recognition and can potentially improve treatment outcomes and compliance. This scoping review aims to synthesize evidence on the key determinants that are most valued by breast cancer patients when deciding on their treatment options. METHODS: We searched three electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and CINAHL Plus) utilizing a systematic scoping review method. Two reviewers independently screened, applied inclusion criteria, reviewed, and synthesized findings. A mixed-method narrative approach combining the inductive thematic analysis and content analysis methodologies was used to synthesize and summarize the findings. RESULTS: The review included 22 studies, leading to the conceptualization of 5 overarching themes and 17 sub-themes. Among these, the most frequently cited theme was treatment benefits, followed by treatment-related process, treatment-related risk, quality of life, and cost of treatment. Women with breast cancer highly value treatments that offer good effectiveness, prolong survival, prevent recurrence, and maintain quality of life. Patient concerns include treatment-related side effects, safety, the risk of secondary cancer, and direct or indirect out-of-pocket costs. Additionally, patients also consider treatment duration, mode of administration, physician recommendation, and treatment availability and accessibility when deciding on their preferred treatment. CONCLUSION: The evidence synthesized in this review offers insights into refining breast cancer treatment strategies to align more closely with patient values. Recognizing and integrating patient perspectives in breast cancer care could potentially lead to improved treatment outcomes, enhanced patient compliance, and more personalized care. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to incorporate these key determinants in their treatment decision-making processes, aiming to deliver a patient-centered care that aligns with the unique preferences and values of each patient.",1
Report of consensus panel 2 from the 11th international workshop on Waldenström's macroglobulinemia on the management of relapsed or refractory WM patients.,"The consensus panel 2 (CP2) of the 11th International Workshop on Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (IWWM-11) has reviewed and incorporated current data to update the recommendations for treatment approaches in patients with relapsed or refractory WM (RRWM). The key recommendations from IWWM-11 CP2 include: (1) Chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) and/or a covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase (cBTKi) strategies are important options; their use should reflect the prior upfront strategy and are subject to their availability. (2) In selecting treatment, biological age, co-morbidities and fitness are important; nature of relapse, disease phenotype and WM-related complications, patient preferences and hematopoietic reserve are also critical factors while the composition of the BM disease and mutational status (MYD88, CXCR4, TP53) should also be noted. (3) The trigger for initiating treatment in RRWM should utilize knowledge of patients' prior disease characteristics to avoid unnecessary delays. (4) Risk factors for cBTKi related toxicities (cardiovascular dysfunction, bleeding risk and concurrent medication) should be addressed when choosing cBTKi. Mutational status (MYD88, CXCR4) may influence the cBTKi efficacy, and the role of TP53 disruptions requires further study) in the event of cBTKi failure dose intensity could be up titrated subject to toxicities. Options after BTKi failure include CIT with a non-cross-reactive regimen to one previously used CIT, addition of anti-CD20 antibody to BTKi, switching to a newer cBTKi or non-covalent BTKi, proteasome inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors, and new anti-CD20 combinations are additional options. Clinical trial participation should be encouraged for all patients with RRWM.",0
Evaluation of Preference and Utility Measures for Transoral Thyroidectomy.,"BACKGROUND: Traditional, trans-cervical thyroidectomy results in the presence of a neck scar, which has been shown to correlate with lower quality of life and lower patient satisfaction. Transoral thyroid surgery (TOTS) has been utilized as an alternative approach to avoid a cutaneous incision and scar by accessing the neck and thyroid through the oral cavity. This study was designed to evaluate patient preference through health-state utility scores for TOTS as compared to conventional trans-cervical thyroidectomy. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patient preferences were elicited for TOTS and trans-cervical thyroidectomy with the use of an online survey. Respondents were asked to consider 4 hypothetical health scenarios involving thyroid surgery with varying approaches. Health-state utility scores were elicited using visual analog scale and standard gamble exercises. RESULTS: Overall, 516 respondents completed the survey, of whom 261 (50.6%) were included for analysis, with a mean age of 41.5 years (SD 14.9 years), including 171 (65.5%) females. Health utility scores were similar for TOTS and conventional transcervical techniques. Statistically significant differences in the standard gamble utility score were noted for gender and ethnicity across all scenarios. Comparisons of visual analog score utilities were not statistically significant based on respondent demographics. CONCLUSION: Preferences for TOTS and trans-cervical thyroidectomy did not significantly differ in the current study. Females and white ethnicity indicated stronger preference for a TOTs approach compared to males and other ethnicities, respectively. Some literature suggests certain types of patients who might prefer minimally invasive thyroidectomy more so than other patients-in keeping with the current findings of this study.",1
Clinical documentation of patient identities in the electronic health record: Ethical principles to consider.,"The American Psychological Association's multicultural guidelines encourage psychologists to use language sensitive to the lived experiences of the individuals they serve. In organized care settings, psychologists have important decisions to make about the language they use in the electronic health record (EHR), which may be accessible to both the patient and other health care providers. Language about patient identities (including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation) is especially important, but little guidance exists for psychologists on how and when to document these identities in the EHR. Moreover, organizational mandates, patient preferences, fluid identities, and shifting language may suggest different documentation approaches, posing ethical dilemmas for psychologists to navigate. In this article, we review the purposes of documentation in organized care settings, review how each of the five American Psychological Association Code of Ethics' General Principles relates to identity language in EHR documentation, and propose a set of questions for psychologists to ask themselves and their patients when making choices about documenting identity variables in the EHR.

Patients' Expectations and Preferences for the Organizational Conditions of the Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme in Poland: A Qualitative Analysis.,"(1) Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a serious health problem in Poland as well as many European Union countries. The study aimed to describe factors that, from the patient's perspective, could increase the attendance rate and regularity of participation in the colorectal cancer screening programme (SP); (2) Methods: The qualitative approach was applied. The study involved six focus interviews conducted with 24 respondents (12 women and 12 men) aged 40-49, who had at least one first-degree family member diagnosed with CRC and persons aged 50-65, living in five selected voivodships (provinces) of Poland. The collected data were thematically coded. Further, a comparative analysis was conducted, and aggregated statements were formulated; (3) Results: The inclusion of primary care clinics within the CRC SP organization was reported as a key factor in improving the attendance rate and regularity of patient participation in the programme. Particularly important factors included an invitation in the form of a personal letter or a phone call made by staff from primary care clinics; (4) Conclusions: Patients were confirmed to have clear expectations and preferences for the organizational conditions of the CRC SP. Preferences nature allows them to be treated as one of the potential criteria for selecting critical parameters of CRC SPs.",0
Communication Preferences During Pregnancy Care Among Patients With Primary Spanish Language: A Scoping Review.,"BACKGROUND: Qualified language service providers (QLSPs)-professional interpreters or multilingual clinicians certified to provide care in another language-are critical to ensuring meaningful language access for patients. Designing patient-centered systems for language access could improve quality of pregnancy care. OBJECTIVE: We synthesized and identified gaps in knowledge about communication preferences during pregnancy care among patients with Spanish primary language. METHODS: We performed a scoping review of original research studies published between 2000 and 2022 that assessed communication preferences in Spanish-speaking populations during pregnancy care. Studies underwent title, abstract, and full-text review by three investigators. Data were extracted for synthesis and thematic analysis. RESULTS: We retrieved 1,539 studies. After title/abstract screening, 36 studies underwent full-text review, and 13 of them met inclusion criteria. Two additional studies were included after reference tracing. This yielded a total of 15 studies comprising qualitative (n = 7), quantitative (n = 4), and mixed-methods (n = 4) studies. Three communication preference themes were identified: language access through QLSPs (n = 7); interpersonal dynamics and perceptions of quality of care (n = 9); and information provision and shared decision-making (n = 8). Although seven studies reported a strong patient preference to receive prenatal care from Spanish-speaking clinicians, none of the included studies assessed clinician Spanish language proficiency or QLSP categorization. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have assessed communication preferences during pregnancy care among patients with primary Spanish language. Future studies to improve communication during pregnancy care for patients with primary Spanish language require intentional analysis of their communication preferences, including precision regarding language proficiency among clinicians.",0
Efficacy of different bowel preparation regimen volumes for colorectal cancer screening and compliance with European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy performance measures.,"BACKGROUND: Various volumes of bowel preparation are used in clinical practice. There is conflicting data on the effectiveness of individual regimens. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and compliance of currently used bowel preparations with the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) performance measures using data of the Dutch nationwide colorectal cancer screening (CRC) program. METHODS: In a prospective, multicenter endoscopy database, we identified all CRC screening colonoscopies performed in 15 Dutch endoscopy centers from 2016 to 2020. We excluded procedures without documented bowel preparation or the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) score. Bowel preparation regimens were categorized into three groups, that is, 4-L (polyethylene glycol (PEG)), 2-L (2-L PEG with ascorbic acid) and ≤1-L volumes (sodium picosulfate with magnesium citrate, 1L-PEG with sodium sulfate and ascorbic acid or oral sulfate solution). European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy performance measures included adequate BBPS score (≥6) (>90%), cecal intubation rate (CIR, >90%), adenoma detection rate (ADR, >25%) and polyp detection rate (PDR, >40%). Logistic regression was performed to identify predictive factors for adequate BBPS and patient discomfort. RESULTS: A total of 39,042 CRC screening colonoscopies were included. Boston Bowel Preparation Scale scores, CIR, ADR and PDR for 4L, 2L and ≤1L regimens all met the minimum ESGE performance measures standards. However, an adequate BBPS score was more frequently seen with 2L regimens (98.0%) as compared to 4L (97.1%) and ≤1L regimens (97.0%) (p < 0.001), respectively. In addition, CIR was higher for ≤1L (98.4%) versus 4L (97.7%) and 2L (97.9%) regimens (p = 0.001), ADR higher for lower volume (≤1L (60.0%) and 2L (61.2)) versus higher volume (4L (58.6%)) regimens (p < 0.001), and PDR higher for ≤1L (70.0%) and 2L (70.8%) versus 4L (67.2%) regimens (p < 0.001). Boston Bowel Preparation Scale for ≤1L regimens was higher when combined with bisacodyl (97.3%) than without (95.6%) (p < 0.001). Overall, bisacodyl use was independently associated with higher patient discomfort (odds ratios = 1.47, confidence intervals = 1.26-1.72). CONCLUSIONS: Despite variations in bowel preparation volumes, all regimens meet the minimum ESGE performance measures for bowel preparation and other quality parameters. Boston Bowel Preparation Scale can be further improved if ultra low volume regimens are combined with bisacodyl. The choice for either bowel preparation volume can therefore be based on volume-tolerance and patient preference.",0
SAMCEP Society consensus on the treatment of upper facial lines with botulinum neurotoxin type A: A tailored approach.,"BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNTA) treatments are well established, but injection techniques, target muscles, and toxin doses continue to evolve, with each refinement producing improvements in treatment outcomes. The recommendations in this consensus move away from standard templates and illustrate how to tailor treatments to individual patterns and strengths of muscle activity, and patient preferences. METHODS: Seventeen experts in the fields of plastic surgery, dermatology, ophthalmology, otorhinolaryngology, and neurology convened in 2022 to develop consensus-based recommendations for the use of botulinum toxin A for the treatment of horizontal forehead lines, glabellar frown lines, and crow's feet lines that reflect current clinical practice. The focus was on how to tailor injections to individual patients to optimize treatment outcomes. RESULTS: For each upper face indication, consensus members describe how to perform a dynamic assessment to optimize the dose and injection technique for each patient. A tailored treatment protocol is presented for commonly observed patterns of dynamic lines. Units of Inco are defined and the precise location of injection points, illustrated with the use of anatomical images. CONCLUSION: This consensus provides up-to-date recommendations on the tailored treatment of upper facial lines based on the latest research and collective clinical experience of the expert injectors. Optimal outcomes require thorough patient evaluation, both at rest and during animation, using both visual and tactile cues; detailed understanding of facial muscular anatomy and how opposing muscles interact; and use of a BoNTA with high precision to target identified zones of excess muscle activity.",0

Doctors' attitudes in the situation of delivering bad news: patients' experience and expectations.,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of our research was to find out patients' preferences concerning their doctors' attitudes and behaviour as they deliver bad news to them. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In national research conducted from February to October 2017 using the computer-assisted web interview (CAWI) technique, we studied the statements of 314 adult patients who had received bad medical news from their doctors. Seventy-nine per cent of them were women and 21% were men. Fifty-nine per cent had higher education and 33% had secondary education. A specially designed closed question survey was used as a tool to collect the data. RESULTS: Most of the patients (59.6%) expected a doctor-patient relationship based on partnership and collective decisions concerning further treatment. Patients wanted their doctors to be honest with them, to provide them with solid information and an opportunity to ask questions and discuss the suggested solutions. Less than 2 out of 10 patients expected ""an empathy specialist"". The patients who evaluated their doctors' behaviour and the way bad news was delivered to them negatively were more likely to change doctors or terminate their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The doctor-patient relationship when an unfavourable diagnosis is being communicated is an important aspect, which defines the way people who participate in this difficult situation behave and communicate. Doctors' behaviour during DBN should meet the patients' expectations. Such an attitude guarantees trust towards doctors and results in more positive evaluations on them. Most importantly, it translates directly into the patients' therapeutic behaviours and treatment effects.",0
A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol to Establish How Common Clinical Acupoint Stimulation-Related Therapies Should Be Used for Managing Insomnia.,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have now investigated the effects of common clinical acupoint stimulation-related therapies (ASRTs) following the meridian theory of traditional Chinese medicine for the management of insomnia. However, ASRT choice is currently based on personal clinical experience or patient preference. This study will review the common ASRTs reported in clinical trials and analyze their efficacy and safety for managing insomnia with or without co-morbidities. METHODS: English and Chinese databases will be thoroughly searched, and other potentially eligible trials will be obtained by reviewing reference lists of identified studies and previous reviews. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of common clinical ASRTs to manage insomnia published in peer-reviewed journals will be considered. Sleep quality questionnaires or indices will be considered as the main outcome, while the secondary outcomes will include sleep parameters, daytime dysfunction, quality of life, and adverse effects. Two reviewers will independently investigate eligible RCTs, extract information, analyze their methodological quality, and employ Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to evaluate the strength of the evidence. The treatment impact of various ASRTs will be calculated using meta-analysis techniques, and the degree of study heterogeneity will be assessed using Cochrane's Q and I-squared statistics. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be used to evaluate the reliability of the results. RESULTS: Our systematic review and meta-analysis will present up-to-date evidence on: 1) which common clinical ASRTs are beneficial for the management of insomnia; and 2) whether the effects of common clinical ASRTs on insomnia vary depending on clinical, participant, and treatment characteristics. CONCLUSION: The results of our review should help decision-makers make educated choices regarding evidence-based non-pharmacological management options for insomnia.

Study within a trial of electronic versus paper-based Patient-Reported oUtcomes CollEction (SPRUCE): study protocol for a partially randomised patient preference study.,"INTRODUCTION: Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) are currently collected from trial participants using paper questionnaires by the Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR-CTSU). Streamlining PRO collection using electronic questionnaires (ePRO) may improve data collection and patient experience. Here, we outline our protocol for a Study within a trial of electronic versus paper-based Patient-Reported oUtcomes CollEction (SPRUCE), which investigates the acceptability of ePRO in oncology clinical trials. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: SPRUCE was developed alongside patient and public contributors. SPRUCE runs in multiple host trials with a partially randomised patient preference design, allowing participants to be randomised or choose their preference of electronic or paper questionnaires. Questionnaires are scheduled in accordance with host trial follow-up. The primary objective will assess differences in return rates (compliance) between ePRO and paper PROs at the first timepoint post-host trial intervention in the randomised group. Paper PRO compliance is expected to be 90%. 244 randomised participants are required to exclude ≤80% compliance rates with ePRO (10% non-inferiority margin, with 80% power and one-sided alpha=0.05). SPRUCE aims to assess acceptability of ePRO in oncology clinical trials, establish whether ePRO is acceptable to ICR-CTSU trial participants and can capture complete PRO data, consistent with paper PROs. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The SPRUCE protocol (ICR-CTSU/2021/10074) was approved by the Coventry and Warwick Central Research Ethics Committee (21/WM/0223) on 21 October 2021. Results will be disseminated via presentations, publications and lay summaries. No participant identifiable data will be included. TRIAL REGISTRATION: SWAT169.",0
Do preferences differ based on respondent experience of a health issue and its treatment? A case study using a public health intervention.,"OBJECTIVES: Preference information is increasingly being elicited to support decision-making. Although discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are commonly used, little is known about how respondents' relative experience of a health issue, and its treatment, might impact the results of preference studies. The aim of this study was to explore how preferences differ between groups of individuals with varying levels of experience of a health issue and its treatment, using a weight loss maintenance (WLM) programme as a case study. METHODS: An online DCE survey was provided to four groups, each differing in their level of experience with weight loss and WLM programmes. One group was recruited from a randomised controlled trial of a WLM programme (ISRCTN14657176) and the other three from an online panel. Choice data were analysed using mixed logit models. Relative attribute importance scores and willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates were estimated to enable comparisons between groups. RESULTS: Preferences differed between the groups across different attributes. The largest differences related to the outcome (weight re-gain) and cost attributes, resulting in WTP estimates that were statistically significantly different. The most experienced group was willing to pay £0.35 (95% CI: £0.28, £0.42) to avoid a percentage point increase in weight re-gain, compared with £0.12 (95% CI: £0.08, £0.16) for the least experienced group. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence in a public health setting to suggest that preferences differ based on respondent experience of the health issue and its treatment. Health preference researchers should therefore carefully consider the appropriate composition of their study samples.",1
Effect of Utilizing Cheek Retractors on Patient Satisfaction and Trueness of Peripheral Borders in Maxillary Digital Scans for Totally Edentulous Patients: An In Vivo Study.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of cheek retractors on the accuracy of capturing peripheral borders in totally edentulous digital scans by comparing the conventional impression technique to digital scans made using two different cheek retractors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen edentulous maxillary impressions were made using three techniques: the conventional impression technique, using modeling thermoplastic compound and zinc oxide eugenol paste; the digital intraoral scanning technique using the DIO scan retractor (DIO); and using the Br.nemark lip retractor (BRAN). The control impressions of each patient were poured, scanned using a desktop scanner, then transferred into a three-dimensional analysis software. DIO and BRAN groups were scanned using an intraoral scanner, imported, and superimposed using best fit algorithm on the corresponding control. The root mean square for the whole surface and for particular interest regions were calculated to assess the degree of trueness. The patients' perceptions of the impression techniques were the secondary outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using the one sample T-test and Wilcoxon test (α=.05). RESULTS: Significant discrepancies were found for BRAN and DIO compared to the control. No significant discrepancies were found when comparing RMS of BRAN and DIO at different regions. Scan retractors had a significant impact on patient satisfaction, with patients preferring DIO. CONCLUSIONS: Edentulous intraoral scans made using cheek retractors had similar deviations when compared to each other but diverged from the conventional impression in edentulous maxilla. Patient preferences for intraoral scans over conventional impressions were confirmed. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The use of different retracting methods during intraoral scanning of totally edentulous maxillary arches does not affect the peripheral border registration.",0
Acromegaly: Pathophysiological Considerations and Treatment Options Including the Evolving Role of Oral Somatostatin Analogs.,"Acromegaly is a condition most commonly diagnosed in the fifth decade of life and has numerous treatment options. In this regard, Mycapssa(®) is the first FDA-approved oral octreotide capsule for treating acromegaly, combining the efficacy of the somatostatin receptor ligand, octreotide, with the ease of a twice-daily oral capsule. Where surgical treatment is not an option, somatostatin analogs, including octreotide, are the first line of medical treatment for acromegaly, requiring regular subcutaneous or intramuscular injections administered by a patient's healthcare provider. Octreotide capsules (Mycapssa(®)) provide an alternative to these somatostatin receptor ligand injections by combining octreotide with other excipients to produce a transient permeability enhancer technology that improves paracellular transport of octreotide across the gastrointestinal wall into the small intestine. Across multiple trials, including open-label (CH-ACM-01), double-blind placebo-controlled (CHIASMA OPTIMAL), and open-label extension of the trial period (CHIASMA OPTIMAL OLE), Mycapssa(®) octreotide capsules maintained a consistent biochemical normalization of IGF-1 and GH levels, safety profiles similar to injected somatostatin receptor ligands, and patient preference to continued treatment with octreotide capsules. While clinical trial data supports the use of octreotide capsules (Mycapssa(®)) in the pharmacological management of GH and IGF-1 levels, very little data exist regarding the drug's efficacy, tolerability, and use in female or pediatric-specific populations. A better understanding of the efficacy, application, and role of oral octreotide capsules in the long-term medical management of acromegaly in a diversity of populations is imperative to best determine the risks/benefits for the clinician.",0
A meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis comparing nonoperative versus operative management for uncomplicated appendicitis: a focus on randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to provide a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing conservative and surgical treatment in a population of adults with uncomplicated acute appendicitis. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL. We have exclusively incorporated randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies involving participants with complicated appendicitis or children were excluded. The variables considered are as follows: treatment complications, complication-free treatment success at index admission and at 1 year follow-up, length of hospital stay (LOS), quality of life (QoL) and costs. RESULTS: Eight RCTs involving 3213 participants (1615 antibiotics/1598 appendectomy) were included. There was no significant difference between the two treatments in terms of complication rates (RR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.61-1.04, P = 0.07, I(2) = 69%). Antibiotics had a reduced treatment efficacy compared with appendectomy (RR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.90, p < 0.00001, I(2) = 87%) and at 1 year was successful in 540 out of 837 (64.6%, RR = 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.77, p < 0.00001, I(2) = 81%) participants. There was no difference in LOS (mean difference - 0.58 days 95% confidence interval - 1.59 to 0.43, p = 0.26, I(2) = 99%). The trial sequential analysis has revealed that, concerning the three primary outcomes, it is improbable that forthcoming RCTs will significantly alter the existing body of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: As further large-scale trials have been conducted, antibiotic therapy proved to be safe, less expensive, but also less effective than surgical treatment. In order to ensure well-informed decisions, further research is needed to explore patient preferences and quality of life outcomes.",0
Patient Engagement in and Adaptations to Delivery of Outpatient Care for Opioid Use Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated adaptations to outpatient care delivery and changes in treatment demand and engagement among patients receiving medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in the months after the declaration of the COVID-19 public health emergency in 2020. METHODS: Data were collected through an online survey (June-November 2020) of outpatient MOUD prescribers. The survey obtained information on outpatient practices' adaptations to MOUD treatment and urine drug screening (UDS) and elicited provider views on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient demand for, and engagement in, treatment. Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine associations among practice characteristics, patient engagement, and service adaptations. RESULTS: Of 516 respondents, 74% reported adaptations to MOUD delivery during the pandemic. Most respondents implemented virtual visits for initial (67%) and follow-up (77%) contacts. Prescribers of buprenorphine were more likely than those who did not prescribe the medication to report MOUD adaptations. Among respondents reporting any MOUD adaptation, 77% made adaptations to their UDS practices. Among 513 respondents who answered COVID-19-related questions, 89% reported that the pandemic had affected the treatment and engagement of their patients. Of these respondents, 30% reported increased difficulty with patient engagement, and 45% reported that their patients preferred virtual visits during this period, whereas 18% endorsed patient preference for in-person visits. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth and federal regulatory easements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic enabled providers to continue treating patients for opioid use disorder in 2020. The results suggest that care adaptations and changes in patient demand and engagement were common in the practices surveyed.",0
Comparison between two patient-reported outcome measures for patients with cervical radiculopathy: A think-aloud study.,"BACKGROUND: The Cervical Radiculopathy Impact Scale (CRIS) and Patient Specific Functional Scale 2.0 (PSFS 2.0) are patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) used to assess activity limitations in patients with cervical radiculopathy (CR). This study a) compared the CRIS subscale 3 and the PSFS 2.0 in patients with CR with respect to completeness and patient preference, b) established the correlation between both PROMs in assessing the individual patient's level of functional limitations and c) assessed the frequency of reported functional limitations. METHODS: Participants with CR participated in semi-structured, individual, face-to-face interviews as part of a ""think-aloud"" process; verbalising their thoughts while completing both PROMs. Sessions were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were recruited. The most frequently reported functional limitation on the CRIS was: 'working at a computer' (n = 17) and overhead activities' (n = 10) for the PSFS 2.0. There was significant moderate positive correlation between the scores on the PSFS 2.0 and the CRIS (Spearman's r = 0.55, n = 22 p = .008). Most patients (n = 18; 82%) preferred the ability to present their own individual functional limitations of the PSFS 2.0. Eleven participants (50%) preferred the 11-point scale of the PSFS 2.0 over the 5-point Likert scale scoring option of the CRIS. CONCLUSION: Both easy to complete PROMs capture functional limitations in patients with CR. Most patients prefer the PSFS 2.0 over the CRIS. The wording and layout of both PROMs need refinement to enhance user-friendliness and avoid misinterpretation.",0
Impact of advance care planning and end-of-life conversations on patients with cancer: An integrative review of literature.,"PURPOSE: The purpose was to review published articles to examine the impact of advance care planning (ACP) and end-of-life (EOL) conversations on patients with cancer, and aimed to compare the findings for congruency with the goals of ACP. DESIGN AND METHOD: The study was guided by Whittemore and Knafl's integrative review methodology. Articles published between 2015 to 2020 were identified through electronic databases. The search included: Cumulative Index for Nursing Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, MEDLINE-Ovid, and MEDLINE full text, and using the MeSH terms. Two hundred and five (205) articles were identified and screened for eligibility, and 15 articles were appraised. FINDINGS: The fifteen (15) articles that met the inclusion criteria included five (5) qualitative, eight (8) quantitative, and two (2) mixed methods. The review analysis revealed six themes emerged in three categories: cancer patients' experience with advance care planning (1) patients' prognostic awareness, (2) decision making; cancer patients' perceived outcomes with advance care planning (3) patient-provider relationship, (4) concordance in care based on goals, and cancer patients' propositions related to advance care planning, (5) timings of advance care planning discussions, and (6) support during ACP and/or EOL conversations. CONCLUSION: ACP and EOL conversations play a critical role in cancer patients' awareness of their disease and prognosis and help them in making end-of-life care decisions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There exists a need for earlier ACP and EOL conversations with cancer patients with emotional support during these conversations.",0
Stroke survivors' preferences for post-stroke self-management programs: A discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Self-management programs enhance survival in stroke patients. However, they require patient-centered designs to be effective. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the type of post-stroke self-management programs that appeal to stroke survivors, and to estimate their willingness to participate in such programs. METHODS: A Discrete Choice Experiment was administered to patients who had either a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke within the past 3 years and were cognitively intact (i.e., stroke survivors). Stroke survivors were presented with eight choice tasks and asked to choose between 'No Program' and two hypothetical post-stroke management programs that varied by six attributes: Topics covered by the program; schedule of the program; frequency and duration of the sessions; number of participants; out-of-pocket registration fee for the whole program; and rewards for completing the program. RESULTS: The analysis involved 146 stroke survivors. Based on the mixed logit model, the predicted willingness to participate ranged from 53% to 76%. The most popular characteristics in a program were topics on health education and risk management, being scheduled during weekends as four sessions that are each 2 hours long and involve four participants, a registration fee of SGD50 (∼USD36), and SGD500 (∼USD359) reward for program completion. CONCLUSIONS: Interest in post-stroke self-management programs was high, with at least half of the sample showing interest in participating in these programs. Program features such as focusing on health education and risk management, charging a low registration fee, and offering incentives helped to increase the demand.",1
Conventional standard-sized bra with prosthesis or patient's bra with customized hand-knitted external prosthesis after mastectomy: Mixed-methods evaluation of patients' preferences.,"INTRODUCTION: In breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy without reconstruction, an external breast prosthesis could aid patients' recovery, improve body image and confidence by helping to regain a symmetrical chest appearance when dressed. However, external breast prosthesis preferences among Asian breast cancer patients were not widely studied. We aimed to compare patients' experience with the conventional commercially manufactured standard-sized (small, medium, large, extra-large) bra and prosthesis versus customized hand-knitted external breast prosthesis with patient's bra after unilateral mastectomy at a tertiary hospital. This is the first such study in Asian women, to our knowledge. METHODS: In this prospective study, participants used the conventional bra-prosthesis followed by the customized one consecutively, each for at least 3 months before they were administered an identical questionnaire at 3 and 6 months respectively. The questionnaire assessed the patients' experience with the prosthesis on the aspects of comfort, body image and satisfaction etc. Patients were also invited for in-depth interviews. RESULTS: Of 155 eligible patients, 148 patients participated with a response rate of 95.5%. 99 (67%) participants preferred the customized prosthesis, while 38 (25.7%) did not. 11 (7.4%) participants were undecided. Seventeen participants underwent in-depth interviews until data saturation on major qualitative themes was achieved. More patients experienced excessive sweating (p < 0.0001), greater discomfort (p = 0.0195) and higher rates of prosthesis dislodgement (p = 0.0269) with the conventional bra-prosthesis. CONCLUSION: Customized external breast prostheses could be an alternative to the conventional ones for breast cancer patients with mastectomy, with additional benefits of less sweating, more comfort and less dislodgement perceived.",0
Total Neoadjuvant Therapy (TNT) with Full Dose Concurrent Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Adenocarcinoma Including Signet Ring and Mucinous Cancers.,"PURPOSE: Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) with pre-operative chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy results in improved survival and is becoming the new standard of care in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). We describe our experience with TNT consisting of induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy using full dose 5FU without oxaliplatin. METHODS: Adults with biopsy-proven, newly diagnosed LARC with high-risk characteristics on pelvic MRI (T4a or T4b, extramural vascular invasion, N2, mesorectal fascia involvement, enlargement/tumor deposits on lateral lymph nodes) were included. The TNT protocol comprised of six biweekly courses of modified FOLFOX6 followed by pelvic RT with four concurrent cycles of biweekly 5-FU 2600 mg/m2 + LV 200 mg/m2 without oxaliplatin to complete 20 uninterrupted weeks of full dose 5FU. Surgery was planned 11-13 weeks after completing chemoradiotherapy. RESULTS: Eighty-four LARC patients, including 26% with signet-ring cell carcinoma, with high-risk MRI characteristics were treated with the TNT protocol with a 96% completion rate. Significant (> grade 3) toxicities included neutropenia (23.8%), diarrhea (14.2%) anemia (10.7%), and two deaths. The median DFS at 2 years was 22.5 months with better survival noted for those who underwent surgery or had cCR (with NOM) compared to those who did not undergo surgery (due to progression, inadequate regression, or patient preference despite residual disease) -mDFS 27.7 months versus 11.4 months, p =  < 0.0001 and mOS 29.2 months versus 15 months p =  < 0.0001. CONCLUSION: The hybrid TNT regimen was administered without significant dose delays or interruptions. Toxicity was manageable but with two treatment-related deaths. Ability to undergo surgery after TNT predicted for improved DFS and OS.",0
Outcome measures for young people with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: A qualitative exploration of healthcare professionals' perceptions and practices.,"BACKGROUND: Limited knowledge exists on current use of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) and performance measures for adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), as well as health care professionals' (HCPs) perceived barriers and facilitators towards their use. This study's objectives were: 1) to explore current practice of HCPs when assessing outcomes for AIS 2) to understand perceived barriers and facilitators of HCPs to use PROMs 3) to understand perceived barriers and facilitators of HCPs to use performance measures. METHODS: A qualitative study recruited a purposive sample of HCPs from a tertiary hospital in the United Kingdom. Mean years of experience managing individuals with AIS was 11.8 years; and included surgeons, physiotherapists and nurses, educated at Bachelor, Masters and Doctoral level. Consent to participate and demographic information were collected in advance of the interviews. In-depth, virtual semi-structured interviews were informed by a topic guide based on current evidence. Interviews of approximately 45 minutes were audio and video recorded and transcribed verbatim alongside written field notes. Data were coded and analysed using inductive thematic analysis, involving researchers with topic and methodological expertise and input from a patient representative. RESULTS: Two themes emerged regarding current practice of using PROMs routine practice and personal evaluations. Four themes emerged as barriers to using PROMs for individuals with AIS: priority and support (e.g., HCPs focus on providing care), practical challenges (e.g., inadequate PROMs), patient-related challenges (e.g., patient preferences) and knowledge, education, and perceived value. Two themes emerged as facilitators: quality existing measure (e.g., sufficient psychometric properties), and priority and support (e.g., research department/culture). Themes for barriers to use performance measures were practicality (e.g., need physical space) and perceived value and knowledge (e.g., PROMs are more important), while the one theme for facilitators was practical consideration (e.g., acceptability). CONCLUSIONS: Although HCPs perceived the value of using outcome measures, current practice indicates limited use for individuals with AIS. The findings revealed different barriers and facilitators to implement PROMs in practice. Adopting performance measure are limited due to lack of knowledge and perceived value alongside the practicality, while considering practical factors can improve the use of these measures in practice.",0
Visual-Olfactory Training and Patient Preference in Treatment of COVID-19 Olfactory Loss-How Salient Stimuli Might Support Recovery of Smell-Reply.,.,0
"""A disembodied voice over the telephone"": a qualitative study of healthcare practitioners' experiences in geriatric medicine.","OBJECTIVES: This study explored the experience of delivering care remotely among practitioners in a UK geriatric medicine clinic. METHODS: Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with consultants (n = 5), nurses (n = 2), a speech and language and an occupational therapist, and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Four themes developed; Challenges of remote consultations; Perceived advantages of remote consultations; Disruption of involvement of family members; Impact on care staff. Participants felt that rapport and trust had been more feasible to develop remotely than they had anticipated, although this was more challenging for new patients and those with cognitive or sensory impairments. While practitioners identified advantages of remote consultations, including involving relatives, saving time, and reducing anxiety, they also experienced disadvantages such as consultations feeling like a 'production line', missing visual cues and reduced privacy. Some participants felt their professional identity was threatened by the lack of face-to-face contact, linked to feeling that remote consultations are not suitable for frail older adults or those with cognitive deficits. DISCUSSION: Staff perceived barriers to remote consultations that went beyond practical concerns, and suggest support for building rapport, involving families, and protecting clinician identity and job satisfaction may be warranted.",0
"Family Members' Engagement in Symptom Communication, Assessment, and Management in the Intensive Care Unit: A Qualitative Study.","BACKGROUND: Opportunities for communication and participation in decision making are limited for critically ill patients, but family members serving as surrogates enable empowerment of these patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore family members' engagement in symptom communication in the intensive care unit. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design using fieldwork methodology with triangulation of participant observation and individual interviews was conducted. Nine mechanically ventilated patients were observed in interaction with family members and clinicians in the intensive care unit. Six of the observed patients, 6 family members, and 9 clinicians were interviewed after participant observation. Field notes and transcripts were analyzed using Braun and Clarke's method of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Family members engaged actively in symptom communication, assessment, and management, and there were barriers and facilitators to family engagement. Three main themes and 9 subthemes describing family engagement emerged: (1) intermediary role (recognize and report symptoms, provide patient information, and assist in communication), (2) independent role (provide familiarity, manage symptoms, and promote patient communication), and (3) conditions for family engagement (intensive care unit environment, relationship with the patient, and patient preferences). DISCUSSION: Family members have unique knowledge of the patient that differs from and complement the competence of the staff, and might contribute to improved symptom communication. Future research should examine how family members can contribute to symptom communication, assessment, and management.",0
ACTivity as medicine In Oncology for Head and Neck (ACTIOHN): Protocol for a feasibility study investigating a patient-centred approach to exercise for people with head and neck cancer.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Attempts at personalisation of exercise programmes in head and neck cancer (HaNC) have been limited. The main aim of the present study is to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of introducing a remotely delivered, fully personalised, collaborative, and flexible approach to prescribing and delivering exercise programmes into the HaNC usual care pathway. METHODS: This is a single arm, feasibility study. Seventy patients diagnosed with HaNC will be recruited from two regional HaNC centres in the United Kingdom. Patients will undertake an 8-week exercise programme designed and delivered by cancer exercise specialists. The exercise programme will start any time between the time of diagnosis and up to 8 weeks after completing treatment, depending on patient preference. The content of the exercise programme will be primarily based on patient needs, preferences, and goals, but guided by current physical activity guidelines for people with cancer. The primary outcome measure is retention to the study. Secondary quantitative outcomes are uptake to the exercise programme, different measures of exercise adherence, pre- and post-intervention assessments of fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form), quality of life (SF-36), physical activity levels (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form), and various components of physical fitness. The outcomes of the nested qualitative study are acceptability and feasibility of the intervention evaluated via interviews with patients, health care professionals, and the cancer exercise specialists. Intervention and participant fidelity will be determined using checklists and scrutiny of each patient's logbook and the cancer exercise specialists' meeting notes. Analysis of quantitative data will be via standard summary statistics. Qualitative data will be analysed using thematic analysis. EXPECTED RESULTS: This feasibility study will inform the design and conduct of a future randomised controlled trial. Success will be defined according to a traffic light system for identifying the appropriateness of progression to a randomised controlled trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry (ISRCTN82505455).",0
A Discrete Choice Analysis Comparing COVID-19 Vaccination Decisions for Children and Adults.,"IMPORTANCE: COVID-19 vaccination rates in the US remain below optimal levels. Patient preferences for different attributes of vaccine products and the vaccination experience can be important in determining vaccine uptake decisions. OBJECTIVE: To assess preferences for attributes of adult and pediatric COVID-19 vaccination among US adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An online survey of a national panel of 1040 US adults was conducted in May and June 2021. A discrete choice analysis was used to measure the relative value of each attribute in the decision to choose a COVID-19 vaccination option for adults or children. Six attributes were used to described hypothetical vaccination options: vaccine effectiveness, mild side effects, rare adverse events, number of doses, time required for vaccination, and regulatory approval. Respondents chose between hypothetical vaccination profiles or no vaccination. Additional survey questions asked about vaccination beliefs, COVID-19 illness experience, COVID-19 risk factors, vaccination status, and opinions about the risk of COVID-19. EXPOSURES: Respondents chose which vaccine profile they would prefer to receive for themselves (or no vaccination). Respondents then considered an identical set of profiles for a hypothetical child aged 0 to 17 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Relative value of vaccination-related attributes were estimated using Bayesian logit regression. Preference profiles for subgroups were estimated using latent class analyses. RESULTS: A total of 1040 adults (610 [59%] female; 379 participants [36%] with an age of 55 years and older years) responded to the survey. When asked about vaccination choices for themselves, participants indicated that vaccine effectiveness (95% vs 60%) was a significant attribute (β, 9.59 [95% CrI, 9.20-10.00] vs β, 0.41 [95% CrI, 0-0.80]). Respondents also preferred fewer rare adverse events (β, 6.35 [95% CrI, 5.74-6.86), fewer mild side effects (β, 5.49; 95% CrI, 5.12-5.87), 1 dose (β, 5.41; 95% CrI, 5.04-5.78), FDA approval (β, 6.01; 95% CrI, 5.64-6.41), and shorter waiting times (β, 5.67; 95% CrI, 4.87-6.48). Results were very similar when framing the question as adult or child vaccination, with slightly stronger preference for fewer rare adverse events for children. Latent class analysis revealed 4 groups of respondents: (1) individuals sensitive to safety and regulatory status, (2) individuals sensitive to convenience, (3) individuals who carefully considered all attributes in making their choices, and (4) individuals who rejected the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of US adults, the identification of 4 distinct preference groups provides new information to guide communications to support vaccine decision making. In particular, the group that prioritize convenience (less time required for vaccination and fewer doses) may present an opportunity to create actionable strategies to increase vaccination uptake for both adult and pediatric populations.",1
A Careful Consideration of the Effect of a Decision Aid on Agreement Between Patient Preferences and Repair Type for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.,.,0
A multi- and mixed-method adaptation study of a patient-centered perioperative mental health intervention bundle.,"BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression are common among older adults and can intensify during perioperative periods, but few mental health interventions are designed for older surgical patients' unique needs. As part of the feasibility trial, we developed and adapted a perioperative mental health (PMH) bundle for older patients comprised of behavioral activation (BA) and medication optimization (MO) to ameliorate anxiety and depressive symptoms before, during, and after cardiac, orthopedic, and oncologic surgery. METHODS: We used mixed-methods including workshop studios with patients, caregivers, clinicians, researchers, and interventionists; intervention refinement and reflection meetings; patient case review meetings; intervention session audio-recordings and documentation forms; and patient and caregiver semi-structured interviews. We used the results to refine our PMH bundle. We used multiple analytical approaches to report the nature of adaptations, including hybrid thematic analysis and content analysis informed by the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications - Expanded. RESULTS: Adaptations were categorized by content (intervention components), context (how the intervention is delivered, based on the study, target population, intervention format, intervention delivery mode, study setting, study personnel), training, and evaluation. Of 51 adaptations, 43.1% involved content, 41.2% involved context, and 15.7% involved training and evaluation. Several key adaptations were noted: (1) Intervention content was tailored to patient preferences and needs (e.g., rewording elements to prevent stigmatization of mental health needs; adjusting BA techniques and documentation forms to improve patient buy-in and motivation). (2) Cohort-specific adaptations were recommended based on differing patient needs. (3) Compassion was identified by patients as the most important element. CONCLUSIONS: We identified evidence-based mental health intervention components from other settings and adapted them to the perioperative setting for older adults. Informed by mixed-methods, we created an innovative and pragmatic patient-centered intervention bundle that is acceptable, feasible, and responsive to the needs of older surgical populations. This approach allowed us to identify implementation strategies to improve the reach, scalability, and sustainability of our bundle, and can guide future patient-centered intervention adaptations.

"A ""Patient Preference"" Model of Recruitment for Research from Primary-Care-Based Memory Clinics: A Promising New Approach.","Recruiting persons with dementia for clinical trials can be challenging. Building on a guide initially developed to assist primary-care-based memory clinics in their efforts to support research, a key stakeholder working group meeting was held to develop a standardized research recruitment process, with input from patients, care partners, researchers, and clinicians. Discussions in this half-day facilitated meeting focused on the wishes and needs of patients and care partners, policy and procedures for researchers, information provided to patients, and considerations for memory clinics. Patients and care partners valued the opportunity to contribute to science and provided important insights on how to best facilitate recruitment. Discussions regarding proposed processes and procedures for research recruitment highlighted the need for a new, patient-driven approach. Accordingly, a key stakeholder co-designed ""Memory Clinic Research Match"" program was developed that has the potential to overcome existing barriers and to increase recruitment for dementia-related research.",0
"Clozapine once- versus multiple-daily dosing: a two-center cross-sectional study, systematic review and meta-analysis.","Evidence regarding effectiveness and safety of clozapine once- vs. multiple-daily dosing is limited. We compared demographic and clinical parameters between patients with once- vs. multiple-daily dosing in the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Regensburg, Germany (AGATE dataset), and the Department of Psychiatry, Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland, using non-parametric tests. Effectiveness and safety outcomes were available in the AGATE dataset. We performed a systematic review in PubMed/Embase until February 2022, meta-analyzing studies comparing clozapine once- vs. multiple-daily-dosing. We estimated a pooled odds ratio for adverse drug-induced reactions (ADRs) and meta-analyzed differences regarding clinical symptom severity, age, percentage males, smokers, clozapine dose, and co-medications between patients receiving once- vs. multiple-daily dosing. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale. Of 1494 and 174 patients included in AGATE and Lausanne datasets, clozapine was prescribed multiple-daily in 74.8% and 67.8%, respectively. In the AGATE cohort, no differences were reported for the clinical symptoms severity or ADR rate (p > 0.05). Meta-analyzing eight cohorts with a total of 2810 clozapine-treated individuals, we found more severe clinical symptoms (p = 0.036), increased ADR risk (p = 0.01), higher clozapine doses (p < 0.001), more frequent co-medication with other antipsychotics (p < 0.001), benzodiazepines (p < 0.001), anticholinergics (p = 0.039), and laxatives (p < 0.001) in patients on multiple- vs. once-daily dosing. Of six studies, five were rated as good, and one as poor quality. Patients responding less well to clozapine may be prescribed higher doses multiple-daily, also treated with polypharmacy, potentially underlying worse safety outcomes. Patient preferences and adherence should be considered during regimen selection.",0
Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy European Patient Survey: Assessing Patient Reported Disease Burden and Preferences in Clinical Trial Participation.,"BACKGROUND: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness leading to permanent disability. There are no curative treatments, however, there are several upcoming clinical trials testing new therapies in FSHD. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the disease burden and patient preferences of people with FSHD to ensure that clinical trials can be designed to include outcome measures that are relevant and important to patients. METHODS: A survey was developed with a steering committee clinicians and physiotherapists with relevant experience in the disease, patient representatives, a registry expert and industry consultants. Themes of the survey included; participant demographics, disease progression and impact on function, factors encouraging or discouraging clinical trial participation, and positive outcomes of a clinical trial. RESULTS: 1147 participants responded to the online survey, representing 26 countries across Europe and a range of disease severities. The study highlighted the key symptoms causing concern for FSHD patients - muscle weakness and mobility issues - reflecting what participants want targeted for future therapies. The need for clear information and communication throughout clinical trials was emphasised. Factors most encouraging trial participation included access to new investigational therapies, access to trial results and benefits for the FSHD community. Factors most discouraging trial participation included travel related issues and fear of side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study identify the patient reported burden of FSHD and should provide researchers and industry with areas of therapeutic research that would be meaningful to patients, as well as supporting the development of patient centric outcome measures in clinical trials.",0
Individual Patient Factors Associated with the Use of Physical or Digital Primary Care in Sweden.,"Introduction: Little is known about factors that influence patients' choice to use physical or digital primary care. This study aimed to compare self-rated health, internet habits, and what patients deem important when choosing health care between users of physical and digital primary health care. Methods: We recruited 2,716 adults visiting one of six physical or four digital primary health care providers in Stockholm, Sweden, October 2020 to May 2021. Participants answered a questionnaire with questions about sociodemography, self-rated health, internet habits, and what they considered important when seeking care. We used logistic regression and estimated odds ratios (ORs) for choosing digital care. Results: Digital users considered themselves healthier and used the internet more, compared with physical users (p < 0.001). Competence of health care staff was the most important factor when seeking care to both physical and digital users (90% and 78%, respectively). Patients considering it important to avoid leaving home were more likely to seek digital care (OR 29.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.65-69.06), while patients valuing continuity were more likely to seek physical care (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.19-0.32). These factors were significant also when adjusting for self-rated health and sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusion: What patients considered important when seeking health care was associated with what type of care they sought. Patient preferences should be considered when planning health care to optimize resource allocation.",0
Current evidence for dietary therapies in irritable bowel syndrome.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet appears to trigger symptoms in the majority of individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and is associated with a reduced quality of life. There has been a recent focus on the role of dietary therapies to manage individuals with IBS. The aim of this review is to discuss the utility of traditional dietary advice (TDA), low-FODMAP diet (LFD) and gluten-free diet (GFD) in IBS. RECENT FINDINGS: Several recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published demonstrating the efficacy of the LFD and GFD in IBS, with the evidence base for TDA being predominantly based on clinical experience, with emerging RCTs evaluating TDA. Only one RCT has been published to date comparing TDA, LFD and GFD head to head, with no difference noted between diets in terms of efficacy. However, TDA has been noted to be more patient-friendly and is commonly implemented as a first-line dietary therapy. SUMMARY: Dietary therapies have been demonstrated to improve symptoms in patients with IBS. In view of insufficient evidence to recommend one diet over another currently, specialist dietetic input in conjunction with patient preference is required to determine implementation of dietary therapies. Novel methods of dietetic delivery are required in view of the lack of dietetic provision to deliver these therapies.",0
Knee Cartilage Lesion Management-Current Trends in Clinical Practice.,"Many patients, particularly those aged above 40, experience knee joint pain, which hampers both sports activities and daily living. Treating isolated chondral and osteochondral defects in the knee poses a significant clinical challenge, particularly in younger patients who are not typically recommended partial or total knee arthroplasty as alternatives. Several surgical approaches have been developed to address focal cartilage defects. The treatment strategies are characterized as palliation (e.g., chondroplasty and debridement), repair (e.g., drilling and microfracture), or restoration (e.g., autologous chondrocyte implantation, osteochondral autograft, and osteochondral allograft). This review offers an overview of the commonly employed clinical methods for treating articular cartilage defects, with a specific focus on the clinical trials conducted in the last decade. Our study reveals that, currently, no single technology fully meets the essential requirements for effective cartilage healing while remaining easily applicable during surgical procedures. Nevertheless, numerous methods are available, and the choice of treatment should consider factors such as the location and size of the cartilage lesion, patient preferences, and whether it is chondral or osteochondral in nature. Promising directions for the future include tissue engineering, stem cell therapies, and the development of pre-formed scaffolds from hyaline cartilage, offering hope for improved outcomes.",0
Patients' perspectives and preferences toward telemedicine versus in-person visits: a mixed-methods study on 1226 patients.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the fact that telemedicine can eliminate geographical and time limitations and offer the possibility of diagnosing, treating, and preventing diseases by sharing reliable information, many individuals still prefer to visit medical centers for in-person consultations. The aim of this study was to determine the level of acceptance of telemedicine compared to in-person visits, identify the perceived advantages of telemedicine over in-person visits, and to explore the reasons why patients choose either of these two types of visits. METHODS: We developed a questionnaire using the rational method. The questionnaire consisted of multiple-choice questions and one open-ended question. A total of 2059 patients were invited to participate in the study. Chi-square tests and descriptive statistics were employed for data analysis. To analyze the data from the open-ended question, we conducted qualitative content analysis using MAXQDA 18. RESULTS: Out of the 1226 participants who completed the questionnaire, 865 (71%) preferred in-person visits, while 361 (29%) preferred telemedicine. Factors such as education level, specific health conditions, and prior experience with telemedicine influenced the preference for telemedicine. The participants provided a total of 183 different reasons for choosing either telemedicine (108 reasons) or in-person visits (75 reasons). Avoiding infectious diseases, saving cost, and eliminating and overcoming geographical distance barriers were three primary telemedicine benefits. The primary reasons for selecting an in-person visit were: more accurate diagnosis of the disease, more accurate and better examination of the patient by the physician, and more accurate and better treatment of the disease. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that despite the numerous benefits offered by telemedicine, the majority of patients still exhibit a preference for in-person visits. In order to promote broader acceptance of telemedicine, it becomes crucial for telemedicine services to address patient preferences and concerns effectively. Employing effective change management strategies can aid in overcoming resistance and facilitating the widespread adoption of telemedicine within the population.",0
Treatment preferences among Japanese patients and physicians for epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence is limited on preferences of Japanese patients and physicians in treatment for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several oral or intravenous novel agents for EGFR exon 20 insertions are under development. The aim of our study was to investigate which attributes of novel treatments influenced selection of oral or intravenous agents among treated patients and treating physicians in Japan. METHODS: The study was designed by board-certified oncologists, patient representatives, and analytics specialists. Eligible participants completed an online survey with a discrete choice experiment presenting two treatment profiles described by attributes: mode of administration (oral or intravenous); frequency of administration; overall response rate (ORR); average progression-free survival (PFS); chance of experiencing severe side effects (SEs); mild-moderate gastrointestinal SEs; mild-moderate skin-related SEs; and patient out-of-pocket costs. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (all self-reported EGFR-mutant) and 74 physicians participated from December 2021 to August 2022. All attributes being equal, there was greater preference for oral administration. However, there was greater preference for intravenous over oral, when ORR and PFS improved by 10% and 1 month, and severe SEs reduced by 10%. Physicians exhibited greater preference for PFS compared to patients (p < 0.01). Ranked order of attribute importance was as follows: (1) PFS; (2) ORR; (3) severe SEs, expressed by patients and physicians alike. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed Japanese physician and patient preferences in treatment options for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Compared to the strong preference for a more efficacious drug, the preference of oral versus intravenous revealed a smaller impact.",1
Driving factors in treatment decision-making of patients seeking medical assistance for infertility: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: ART differs in effectiveness, side-effects, administration, and costs. To improve the decision-making process, we need to understand what factors patients consider to be most important. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: We conducted this systematic review to assess which aspects of ART treatment (effectiveness, safety, burden, costs, patient-centeredness, and genetic parenthood) are most important in the decision-making of patients with an unfulfilled wish to have a child. SEARCH METHODS: We searched studies indexed in Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL prior to November 2023. Discrete choice experiments (DCEs), surveys, interviews, and conjoint analyses (CAs) about ART were included. Studies were included if they described two or more of the following attributes: effectiveness, safety, burden, costs, patient-centeredness, and genetic parenthood.Participants were men and women with an unfulfilled wish to have a child. From each DCE/CA study, we extracted the beta-coefficients and calculated the relative importance of treatment attributes or, in case of survey studies, extracted results. We assessed the risk of bias using the rating developed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group. Attributes were classified into effectiveness, safety, burden, costs, patient-centeredness, genetic parenthood, and others. OUTCOMES: The search identified 938 studies of which 20 were included: 13 DCEs, three survey studies, three interview studies, and one conjoint analysis, with a total of 12 452 patients. Per study, 47-100% of the participants were women. Studies were assessed as having moderate to high risk of bias (critical: six studies, serious: four studies, moderate: nine studies, low: one study). The main limitation was the heterogeneity in the questionnaires and methodology utilized. Studies varied in the number and types of assessed attributes. Patients' treatment decision-making was mostly driven by effectiveness, followed by safety, burden, costs, and patient-centeredness. Effectiveness was rated as the first or second most important factor in 10 of the 12 DCE studies (83%) and the relative importance of effectiveness varied between 17% and 63%, with a median of 34% (moderate certainty of evidence). Of eight studies evaluating safety, five studies valued safety as the first or second most important factor (63%), and the relative importance ranged from 8% to 35% (median 23%) (moderate certainty of evidence). Cost was rated as first or second most important in five of 10 studies, and the importance relative to the other attributes varied between 5% and 47% (median 23%) (moderate certainty of evidence). Burden was rated as first or second by three of 10 studies (30%) and the relative importance varied between 1% and 43% (median 13%) (low certainty of evidence). Patient-centeredness was second most important in one of five studies (20%) and had a relative importance between 7% and 24% (median 14%) (low certainty of evidence). Results suggest that patients are prepared to trade-off some effectiveness for more safety, or less burden and patient-centeredness. When safety was evaluated, the safety of the child was considered more important than the mother's safety. Greater burden (cycle cancellations, number of injections, number of hospital visits, time) was more likely to be accepted by patients if they gained effectiveness, safety, or lower costs. Concerning patient-centeredness, information provision and physician attitude were considered most important, followed by involvement in decision-making, and treatment continuity by the same medical professional. Non-genetic parenthood did not have a clear impact on decision-making. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The findings of this review can be used in future preference studies and can help healthcare professionals in guiding patients' decision-making and enable a more patient-centered approach.",1
Preferences of patients with diabetes mellitus for primary healthcare institutions: a discrete choice experiment in China.,"OBJECTIVES: To quantify the preference of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) for primary healthcare (PHC) institutions in China to redirect the patient flow and improve health outcomes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. Discrete choice experiment (DCE) surveys asked patients with DM to choose between hypothetical institutions that differed in the medical service capacity, out-of-pocket (OOP) medical costs per month, travel time, the attitude of medical staff and the availability of diabetes drugs. SETTING: Shandong province, China. PARTICIPANTS: The participants were 887 patients with DM from 36 urban communities and 36 rural villages in Shandong province. One participant did not provide any DCE answers and a further 57 patients failed the internal consistency test. 829 fully completed surveys were included in the final data analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A mixed logit model was used to calculate the willingness to pay and predict choice probabilities for PHC institution attributes. Preference heterogeneity was also investigated. RESULTS: All five attributes were associated with the preferences of patients with DM. The OOP medical costs and the medical service capacity were the most influential attributes. Improvements simultaneously in the attitude of medical staff, drug availability and travel time increased the likelihood of a patient's PHC institution choice. Preferences differed by region, annual household income and duration of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient preference data may help policymakers improve health services and increase acceptance of choosing PHC institutions. The OOP medical costs and medical service capacity should be regarded as a priority in decision-making.",1
[Integrative medicine: what's new in 2023].,"To illustrate the news of 2023 in integrative medicine, the authors summarized four particularly relevant studies. The first highlights one of the foundational principles of integrative medicine, describing the importance of respecting patient preference in the choice of a therapeutic approach, promoting their «empowerment». The second article proposes methodological recommendations to improve the scientific value of studies assessing the efficacy and mechanisms of non-pharmacological approaches. Finally, the last two articles are randomized studies designed to either demonstrate the feasibility and effect of hypnosis in geriatrics, or evaluate the efficacy of a several combined complementary approaches for cancer-related fatigue.",0
Spinal Versus General Anesthesia for Outpatient Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty in the Ambulatory Surgery Center: A Matched-Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: Spinal anesthesia is the predominant regimen in outpatient total joint arthroplasty (TJA), but induction often is unsuccessful, unobtainable, or against patient preference. We compared outcomes of same-day discharge (SDD) TJA with spinal versus general anesthesia in a free-standing ambulatory surgery center (ASC). METHODS: We took 105 general anesthesia TJA and one-to-one nearest-neighbor matched them to 105 spinal anesthesia TJA over 7 years at 1 ASC. The rate of successful SDD, minutes to discharge, postoperative pain and nausea, and 90-day complications were compared. Postanesthesia care unit outcomes were additionally stratified by spinal anesthetic (mepivacaine versus bupivacaine). RESULTS: All spinal anesthetic patients underwent SDD compared with 103 (98%) general anesthetic patients (P = .498). Mepivacaine spinal anesthesia patients spent the fewest minutes in postanesthesia care unit prior to discharge from the facility (206), followed by general anesthesia (227), and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia (291; P < .001). General anesthesia patients had the highest levels of pain at 1 hour (5.2 versus 1.5 versus 1.5) and 2 hours (3.2 versus 2.0 versus 1.3) postoperatively, and rates of nausea (48 versus 22 versus 28%) compared with mepivacaine and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia, respectively. The 90-day complications (6 versus 7), admissions (1 versus 3), and reoperations (5 versus 2) were similar among spinal and general anesthesia, respectively (P ≥ .445). CONCLUSIONS: Both spinal and general anesthesia led to reliable SDD with similar 90-day complication rates. General anesthesia facilitated faster discharge from the ASC compared with bupivacaine spinal anesthesia but led to higher levels of pain and incidence of nausea postoperatively. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3, Retrospective Cohort Comparison.",0
Associations between Present-on-Admission Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders and Short-Term Outcomes in Patients with Pneumonia.,"OBJECTIVES: Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders are used to express patient preferences for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This study examined whether early DNR orders are associated with differences in treatments and outcomes among patients hospitalized with pneumonia. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 768,015 adult patients hospitalized with pneumonia from 2010 to 2015 in 646 US hospitals. The exposure was DNR orders present on admission. Secondary analyses stratified patients by predicted in-hospital mortality. Main outcomes included in-hospital mortality, length of stay, cost, intensive care admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, noninvasive ventilation, vasopressors, and dialysis initiation. RESULTS: Of 768,015 patients, 94,155 (12.3%) had an early DNR order. Compared with those without, patients with DNR orders were older (mean age 80.1 ± 10.6 years vs 67.8 ± 16.4 years), with higher comorbidity burden, intensive care use (31.6% vs 30.6%), and in-hospital mortality (28.2% vs 8.5%). After adjustment via propensity score weighting, these patients had higher mortality (odds ratio [OR] 2.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.33-2.45) and lower use of intensive therapies such as vasopressors (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.81-0.85) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.66-0.70). Although there was little relationship between predicted mortality and DNR orders, among those with highest predicted mortality, DNR orders were associated with lower intensive care use compared with those without (66.7% vs 80.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with early DNR orders have higher in-hospital mortality rates than those without, but often receive intensive care. These orders have the most impact on the care of patients with the highest mortality risk.",0
Preferences of people living with HIV for injectable and oral antiretroviral treatment in the Netherlands: a discrete choice experiment.,"ABSTRACTInjectable antiretroviral treatment (ART) represents a new effective and potentially more convenient alternative to oral ART for people living with HIV (PLWH). This study assessed preferences of PLWH for long-acting injectable compared with oral ART in the Netherlands. A labelled discrete choice experiment presented 12 choice sets of long-acting injectable and oral ART. PLWH were asked to select their preferred ART, described by six attributes: location of administration, dosing frequency, risk of short-term side effects, drug-drug interaction, forgivability, and food and mealtime restrictions. Random parameters logit and latent class models were used to estimate preferences of PLWH. 98.6% of 76 respondents were experienced oral ART users that had taken ART for a median of 12 years (Q1-Q3: 7.0-20.0). 30 (39.5%) respondents chose long-acting injectable ART in all choice tasks and 22 (28.9%) always chose oral ART. The random parameter model showed that, on average, respondents significantly favoured long-acting injectable ART over oral ART, preferred administration of the long-acting injectable ART at home, and a less frequent regimen. The latent class model confirmed one class strongly preferring long-acting injectable ART and one class slightly preferring oral ART. This study highlights the value for both long-acting injectable and oral ART.",1
Chaplain reported plans for end-of-life care conversations: Role clarity for the spiritual care specialists.,"The present study examined chaplain reported plans for patient conversations regarding end-of-life (EOL) care through the lens of multiple goals. Chaplains (n = 69) were asked to curate a plan for engaging with a patient about EOL treatment options, including how they would engage in the conversation and what they would plan to discuss. Findings indicated that plans primarily consisted of relational and identity goals, with a majority navigating multiple goal orientations. Content overwhelmingly involved developing rapport with patients, eliciting patient preferences for care, and serving as a patient liaison. The current study addresses the paucity of research around the role a chaplain plays on the interdisciplinary team and their respective approach to EOL conversations. Examination of curated plans affords insight to what content is prioritized and which conversational goals are present. Integration of multiple goals offers preliminary evidence for conversational quality. Awareness of goal approach and content prioritized affords clarity on how chaplains can be called upon to support members of the interdisciplinary care team.",0
Arteriovenous fistula aneurysmorrhaphy is associated with improved patency and decreased vascular access abandonment.,"BACKGROUND: Upper extremity hemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) can become aneurysmal over time due to repeated cannulation and/or outflow steno-occlusive disease. The optimal surgical management of aneurysmal AVFs (aneurysmorrhaphy vs interposition graft) has remained unclear. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review in which current procedural terminology codes were used to screen for patients who had undergone surgical treatment of aneurysmal AVFs between 2016 and 2021 at a single hospital system. The patients were included after a review of the operative reports. The cases were divided by surgical procedure (aneurysmorrhaphy vs interposition graft placement). The patients who had undergone primary AVF ligation or other types of repair were excluded. The primary outcomes were primary assisted and secondary patency, and the secondary outcome was dialysis access abandonment. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to test the association between the type of AVF aneurysm repair and the primary and secondary outcomes. RESULTS: From 2016 to 2021, 6951 patients had undergone 16,190 dialysis access procedures. Of these procedures, 381 (2.4%) were related to surgical treatment of an aneurysmal AVF. We excluded 58 primary AVF ligation cases and 20 cases involving other types of repair, leaving 303 cases for analysis. These were divided into two groups: aneurysmorrhaphy (n = 123; 41%) and interposition graft (n = 180; 59%). No differences were found between the groups in male gender (68% vs 63%), hypertension (98% vs 98%), or central stenosis (14% vs 22%). The patients who had undergone aneurysmorrhaphy were younger (median age, 54 years vs 59 years); had had a lower rate of diabetes (41% vs 59%), coronary artery disease (41% vs 58%), and congestive heart failure (41% vs 55%); and were less likely to have undergone upper arm access (72% vs 92%). The median follow-up was 11.1 months (interquartile range, 3.6-25.2 months). No differences were found in the incidence of 30-day wound complications (1% vs 3%) or surgical site infections (4% vs 6%). On multivariable Cox regression, interposition graft placement was associated with the loss of primary assisted patency (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-4.95), loss of secondary patency (aHR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.21-7.94), and abandonment of dialysis access (aHR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.61-5.87; P < .05 for all) at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: AVF aneurysmorrhaphy was associated with improved primary assisted and secondary patency and decreased abandonment of dialysis access. We suggest using aneurysmorrhaphy when AVF aneurysms are indicated for repair. However, individual factors such as patient comorbidities, AVF anatomy, remaining dialysis access options, and patient preference should be considered when planning the surgical approach.",0
Peri-procedural and mid-term follow-up age-related differences in leadless pacemaker implantation: Insights from a multicenter European registry.,"BACKGROUND: Age-related differences on leadless pacemaker (LP) are poorly described. Aim of this study was to compare clinical indications, periprocedural and mid-term device-associated outcomes in a large real-world cohort of LP patients, stratified by age at implantation. METHODS: Two cohorts of younger and older patients (≤50 and > 50 years old) were retrieved from the iLEAPER registry. The primary outcome was to compare the underlying indication why a LP was preferred over a transvenous PM across the two cohorts. Rates of peri-procedural and mid-term follow-up major complications as well as LP electrical performance were deemed secondary outcomes. RESULTS: 1154 patients were enrolled, with younger patients representing 6.2% of the entire cohort. Infective and vascular concerns were the most frequent characteristics that led to a LP implantation in the older cohort (45.8% vs 67.7%, p < 0.001; 4.2% vs 16.4%, p = 0.006), while patient preference was the leading cause to choose a LP in the younger (47.2% vs 5.6%, p < 0.001). Median overall procedural (52 [40-70] vs 50 [40-65] mins) and fluoroscopy time were similar in both groups. 4.3% of patients experienced periprocedural complications, without differences among groups. Threshold values were higher in the younger, both at discharge and at last follow-up (0.63 [0.5-0.9] vs 0.5 [0.38-0-7] V, p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: When considering LP indications, patient preference was more common in younger, while infective and vascular concerns were more frequent in the older cohort. Rates of device-related complications did not differ significantly. Younger patients tended to have a slightly higher pacing threshold at mid-term follow-up.",0
Real-World Effectiveness of Dolutegravir/Lamivudine in People With HIV-1 in Test-and-Treat Settings or With High Baseline Viral Loads: TANDEM Study Subgroup Analyses.,"INTRODUCTION: Dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC) was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019 for the treatment of antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive people with HIV-1 based on results from the pivotal GEMINI-1/GEMINI-2 trials. Around that time, immediate initiation of treatment upon diagnosis was recommended in the US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines. Here we report results from 126 treatment-naive people with HIV-1 who initiated DTG/3TC as part of a test-and-treat strategy (n = 61) or with high baseline viral loads (HIV-1 RNA ≥ 100,000 copies/ml; n = 16) from the TANDEM study. METHODS: TANDEM was a US-based, retrospective chart review study that included a cohort of 126 individuals aged ≥ 18 years with no prior history of ART who initiated DTG/3TC before September 30, 2020, and had ≥ 6 months of follow-up. Test-and-treat was defined as ART initiation shortly after diagnosis without available viral load, CD4 + cell count, or HIV-1 resistance data. Outcomes included virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml; overall and by baseline viral load) and discontinuations. Analyses were descriptive. RESULTS: Among 61 individuals who initiated DTG/3TC in a test-and-treat setting (median [interquartile range (IQR)] treatment duration, 1.3 [0.9-1.7] years), 57 (93%) achieved virologic suppression, and 51 (84%) remained suppressed; 1 (< 1%) individual discontinued DTG/3TC due to persistent low-level viremia. The most common healthcare provider (HCP)-reported reason for initiating DTG/3TC was avoidance of long-term toxicities among individuals in the test-and-treat subgroup. Of 16 treatment-naive individuals with high baseline viral loads (median [IQR] treatment duration, 100,000-250,000 copies/ml: 1.2 [0.8-1.8] years; > 250,000 copies/ml: 1.0 [0.7-1.1] years), 14 (88%) achieved virologic suppression, 13 (81%) remained suppressed, and none discontinued DTG/3TC. Patient preference was the most common HCP-reported reason for initiating DTG/3TC in this subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate real-world effectiveness of DTG/3TC, with few discontinuations, in people with HIV-1 in test-and-treat settings or with high baseline viral loads.",0
Preferences for Genetic Testing to Predict the Risk of Developing Hereditary Cancer: A Systematic Review of Discrete Choice Experiments.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding service user preferences is key to effective health care decision making and efficient resource allocation. It is of particular importance in the management of high-risk patients in whom predictive genetic testing can alter health outcomes. PURPOSE: This review aims to identify the relative importance and willingness to pay for attributes of genetic testing in hereditary cancer syndromes. DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, HMIC, Web of Science, and EconLit using discrete choice experiment (DCE) terms combined with terms related to hereditary cancer syndromes, malignancy synonyms, and genetic testing. STUDY SELECTION: Following independent screening by 3 reviewers, 7 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, being a DCE investigating patient or public preferences related to predictive genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes. DATA EXTRACTION: Extracted data included study and respondent characteristics, DCE attributes and levels, methods of data analysis and interpretation, and key study findings. DATA SYNTHESIS: Studies covered colorectal, breast, and ovarian cancer syndromes. Results were summarized in a narrative synthesis and the quality assessed using the Lancsar and Louviere framework. LIMITATIONS: This review focuses only on DCE design and testing for hereditary cancer syndromes rather than other complex diseases. Challenges also arose from heterogeneity in attributes and levels. CONCLUSIONS: Test effectiveness and detection rates were consistently important to respondents and thus should be prioritized by policy makers. Accuracy, cost, and wait time, while also important, showed variation between studies, although overall reduction in cost may improve uptake. Patients and the public would be willing to pay for improved detection and clinician over insurance provider involvement. Future studies should seek to contextualize findings by considering the impact of sociodemographic characteristics, health system coverage, and insurance policies on preferences. HIGHLIGHTS: Test effectiveness and detection rates are consistently important to respondents in genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes.Reducing the cost of genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes may improve uptake.Individuals are most willing to pay for a test that improves detection rates, identifies multiple cancers, and for which results are shared with a doctor rather than with an insurance provider.",1
Cost-Utility Analysis of the Port Delivery System with Ranibizumab for Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"PURPOSE: To quantify the cost-utility ratio of the ranibizumab Port Delivery System (PDS; SUSVIMO) versus intravitreal ranibizumab injections for treating neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) based upon Archway Phase 3 Trial data. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. SUBJECTS: Archway Phase 3 Clinical Trial nAMD participants previously responsive to anti-VEGF therapy were randomized 3:2. Two hundred forty received PDS refills q 24 weeks and 162 received ranibizumab injections. METHODS: Ophthalmic patient, time tradeoff utilities, direct medical and societal cost perspectives, 12-year, 1-year, and 5-year timelines, United States 2022 real dollars, and a 3% annual discount rate were employed. Utilities were adjusted for nAMD conversion in fellow eyes during the 12-year, mean participant life expectancy. Premature death associated with severe vision loss was integrated as per the population-based Salisbury Eye Evaluation Study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) accruals, costs, and incremental and average cost-utility ratios in $/QALY (dollars expended per QALY gained). RESULTS: Versus no therapy, the 1-year PDS QALY gain was 0.0156 (6.8%) versus 0.0063 (0.82%) for intravitreal injections (P < 0.001), whereas the respective 12-year QALY gains were 1.714 (28%) and 1.639 (26.8%) (P = 0.99). One-year direct PDS ophthalmic costs totaled $21 825 with 2 ranibizumab fills, whereas ranibizumab injection therapy totaled $18 405 with 11.8 injections. The 1-year incremental PDS $/QALY versus injections was cost effective at $75 497/QALY. Five-year PDS therapy was not incrementally cost effective at $304 108/QALY, nor was the 12-year therapy at $761 646/QALY. Average 12-year cost-utility ratios were $78 773/QALY for the PDS and $47 917/QALY for injection therapy. Adding -$476 442 12-year offsetting societal costs netted $314 521 to society per PDS participant versus $370 958 per participant for injection therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ranibizumab PDS therapy was not incrementally cost effective versus ranibizumab injection therapy at 12 or 5 years but was at 1 year. Injection therapy had a more favorable 12-year average cost-utility ratio. Vision gain was the major determinant of participant value gain and was the same for both interventions. Both interventions were highly cost effective utilizing average cost-utility analysis with the societal cost perspective.

"Shared Decision-Making in the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis: Results of a Cross-Sectional, Real-World Survey in Europe and the United States.","INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive deterioration of cognitive and physical functioning, reducing activities of daily living and quality of life (QoL). Several treatments are available that modify the course of the disease and reduce the frequency of relapses. Although effective, all treatment options are accompanied by adverse events, and this study aimed to assess the extent to which patients were involved in the choice of treatment. METHODS: Data were drawn from the Adelphi Multiple Sclerosis Disease Specific Program (DSP)™, a cross-sectional survey of healthcare practitioners (HCP) and their patients with MS in real-world clinical settings in Europe and the United States (US) between December 2020 and July 2021. HCPs reported patient demographics, clinical characteristics, current and previous treatment, and treatment outcomes. Patients voluntarily completed questionnaires reporting the physical and psychological impact of their MS and its treatment. Regression analysis with inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to compare treatment outcomes in patients actively involved in their current treatment choice with those who were not. RESULTS: Of a total of 692 patients, median age 40 years and 64% female, mostly diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS, those who were involved in shared decision-making tended to choose oral therapies such as dimethyl fumarate more often than HCPs. MS had greater impact on physical and psychological functioning in patients whose HCP made treatment decisions solely. Patients involved in decision-making reported greater satisfaction with their treatment and a better QoL. DISCUSSION: Because no single optimal therapy exists for patients with MS, treatments should be individualized with consideration of patients' preferences. Our study shows that shared decision-making is under-utilized in the management of MS and supports the benefits of patient involvement. CONCLUSION: Patients who have an active role in treatment decision-making show improved wellbeing and QoL, and overall treatment satisfaction.",0
Cutaneous Sarcoidosis.,"Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease that most commonly affects the lungs, lymphatic system, eyes, and skin but any organ may be involved. Cutaneous sarcoidosis most commonly presents as pink-red to red-brown papules and plaques that commonly affect the head and neck. With the skin being readily accessible for evaluation and biopsy, when sarcoidosis is suspected, dermatologic evaluation may be helpful for establishing a definitive diagnosis. Treatment strategy depends on the severity and distribution of skin lesions and should incorporate patient preference and treatment considerations for other organs that may be involved.",0
Comparison of the Novel Digital Multi-dimension Botong Score with the Brief Pain Inventory for Evaluating Cancer-Related Pain: A Randomized Crossover Trial.,"INTRODUCTION: Pain is a common symptom in patients with cancer, and comprehensive assessments of pain are crucial for decision-making of treatment regimens. This study aimed to compare the practicality of the novel digital multi-dimension Botong score (BTS) and the brief pain inventory (BPI) for evaluating cancer-related pain. METHODS: This randomized crossover trial enrolled patients with cancer-related pain at the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Shandong First Medical University between July and December 2022. The participants were randomized 1:1 to BTS evaluation followed by BPI or vice versa. The consistency of BTS and BPI was analyzed, including pain score and the impact of pain on emotions and sleep. The convenience, patient preference, and the filling time of the two tools were compared. The accuracy of BTS in detecting breakthrough pain and neuropathic pain was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 308 patients with cancer-related pain were screened and 233 were finally included in the analysis. The Pearson correlation coefficients of pain score for BTS and BPI (4 relevant questions) were 0.583 for the worst pain score within 24 h, 0.394 for the mildest pain score within 24 h, 0.551 for the average pain score within 24 h, and 0.511 for the current pain score, respectively (all P < 0.01), indicating a positive correlation between the BTS and BPI pain scores. BTS was superior to BPI for filling time, convenience, and patient preference (191.03 vs. 256.76, 7.70 vs. 6.78, 7.58 vs. 6.70; all P < 0.01). The accuracy of BTS in detecting breakthrough pain and neuropathic pain was 98.28% and 97.42%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pain scores evaluated by BTS have a positive correlation with those evaluated by BPI. BTS reduces the filling time, is more convenient to use, and is more favored by patients. In addition, BTS could help identify breakthrough pain and neuropathic pain. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chictr.org.cn, identifier: ChiCTR220062624.",0
Experience with the US health care system for Black and White patients with advanced prostate cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess differences in reported information about treatment, integration into care, and respect by self-identified Black and White individuals with advanced prostate cancer in the United States. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 701 participants (20% identifying as Black) enrolled in the International Registry for Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer at 37 US sites from 2017 to 2022. Participants were asked six questions from the Cancer Australia National Cancer Control Indicators about their experience with care at study enrollment. Prevalence differences by self-reported race were estimated using marginal standardization of logistic-normal mixed effects models (adjusted for age at enrollment and disease state at enrollment), and 95% CIs were estimated using parametric bootstrapping. RESULTS: Most participants reported a high quality of care for each question. Black participants generally reported higher care quality compared with White participants. Black participants reported more frequently that they were offered a written assessment and care plan (71%) compared with White participants (58%; adjusted difference, 13 percentage points; 95% CI, 4-23). Black participants also reported more frequently being given the name of nonphysician personnel who would support them (64%) than White participants (52%; adjusted difference, 10; 95% CI, 1-20). Prevalence differences did not differ by disease state at enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: Black participants generally reported a higher quality of care compared with White participants. This study calls attention to the need to study potential mediating factors and interpersonal aspects of care in this population to improve survivorship.",0
Pharmacological and Non-pharmacological Approaches for the Management of Neuropathic Pain in Multiple Sclerosis.,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the central nervous system and can cause various types of pain including ongoing extremity pain, Lhermitte's phenomenon, trigeminal neuralgia, and mixed pain. Neuropathic pain is a major concern for individuals with multiple sclerosis as it is directly linked to myelin damage in the central nervous system and the management of neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis is challenging as the options available have limited efficacy and can cause unpleasant side effects. The literature search was conducted across two databases, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Eligible studies included clinical trials, observational studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and narrative reviews. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of literature on pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies employed in the management of neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis. Pharmacological options include cannabinoids, muscle relaxants (tizanidine, baclofen, dantrolene), anticonvulsants (benzodiazepines, gabapentin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine), antidepressants (duloxetine, venlafaxine, tricyclic antidepressants), opioids (naltrexone), and botulinum toxin variants, which have evidence from various clinical trials. Non-pharmacological approaches for trigeminal neuralgia may include neurosurgical methods. Non-invasive methods, physical therapy, and psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction) may be recommended for patients with neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis. The choice of treatment depends on the severity and type of pain as well as other factors, such as patient preferences and comorbidities. There is a pressing need for healthcare professionals and researchers to prioritize the development of better strategies for managing multiple sclerosis-induced neuropathic pain.",0
Burden and prognostic impact of cardiovascular disease in patients with cancer.,"The number of patients at the intersection of cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increasing, reflecting ageing global populations, rising burden of shared cardiometabolic risk factors, and improved cancer survival. Many cancer treatments carry a risk of cardiotoxicity. Baseline cardiovascular risk assessment is recommended in all patients with cancer and requires consideration of individual patient risk and the cardiotoxicity profile of proposed anticancer therapies. Patients with pre-existing CVD are potentially at high or very high risk of cancer-therapy related cardiovascular toxicity. The detection of pre-existing CVD should prompt cardiac optimisation and planning of surveillance during cancer treatment. In patients with severe CVD, the risk of certain cancer therapies may be prohibitively high. Such decisions require multidisciplinary discussion with consideration of alternative anti-cancer therapies, risk-benefit assessment, and patient preference. Current practice is primarily guided by expert opinion and data from select clinical cohorts. There is need for development of a stronger evidence base to guide clinical practice in cardio-oncology. The establishment of multicentre international registries and national-level healthcare data linkage projects are important steps towards facilitating enrichment of cardio-oncology research programmes. In this narrative review, we consider epidemiological trends of cancer and CVD comorbidities and the impact of their co-occurrence on clinical outcomes, current approach to supporting cancer patients with pre-existing CVD and gaps in existing knowledge.",0
Use of Acellular Biologic Matrix Envelope for Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Placement to Correct Migration into Submuscular Breast Implant Pocket.,"Breast implants whether used for cosmetic or reconstructive purposes can be placed in pockets either above or below the pectoralis major muscle, depending on clinical circumstances such as subcutaneous tissue volume, history of radiation, and patient preference. Likewise, cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) can be placed above or below the pectoralis major muscle. When a patient has both devices, knowledge of the pocket location is important for procedural planning and for durability of device placement and performance. Here, we report a patient who previously failed subcutaneous CIED placement due to incision manipulation with prior threatened device exposure requiring plane change to subpectoral pocket. Her course was complicated by submuscular migration of the CIED into her breast implant periprosthetic pocket. With subcutaneous plane change being inadvisable due to patient noncompliance, soft tissue support of subpectoral CIED placement with an acellular biologic matrix (ABM) was performed. Similar to soft tissue support used for breast implants, submuscular CIED neo-pocket creation with ABM was performed with durable CIED device positioning confirmed at 9 months postprocedure.",0
Primary Care Team Perspectives on the Suitability of Telehealth Modality (Phone vs Video) at the Veterans Health Administration.,"INTRODUCTION: Telehealth has the potential to improve access and timeliness of care, enabling primary care teams to deliver hybrid (virtual/in-person) services that will likely extend beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. To optimize its use and sustainability, it is imperative to understand how primary care teams perceive the suitability of telehealth services, including appropriate choice of mode (telephone or video). However, there is limited research on providers' decision-making processes surrounding telehealth use in primary care, including whether to use telephone or video, which this VA-focused study addresses. We examined how primary care (PC) team members determine whether to use telehealth and the mode of delivery, in the care of patients. METHODS: Qualitative case study that included 15 semi-structured interviews with employees who provided or supported telehealth care at primary care clinics at the Veterans Health Administration. We used a team-based rapid analysis approach to identify experiences using telehealth soon after COVID-19's emergence, consisting of the creation of structured summaries of each transcribed interview. The lead author then identified and compiled themes and sub-themes related to the suitability of telehealth in primary care, as well as associated quotes from transcripts. Resulting themes and quotes were reviewed and validated by 2 members of the project team. RESULTS: Primary care team members considered several factors when assessing both the suitability of telehealth for appointments, and mode of use. They were largely guided by patient-related factors including patient preferences, specific health issues, and access to technology. Additional considerations centered on team members' personal preferences and factors that supported the wellbeing of the team, such as the flexibility to work from home (work-life balance) and protection from infection. Generally, participants viewed the option of both telephone and video telehealth modalities as useful tools in the care of patients although a few respondents emphasized its inferiority to in-person care. CONCLUSIONS: Determining the suitability of telehealth services, including appropriate choice of mode is complex. Its suitability is tied to a variety of factors related to multilevel resources, preferences, and timing. When appropriate, telehealth should be considered a useful tool in the care of patients and for employee well-being.",0
Patients accept therapy using embryonic stem cells for Parkinson's disease: a discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: New disease-modifying ways to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) may soon become a reality with intracerebral transplantation of cell products produced from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The aim of this study was to assess what factors influence preferences of patients with PD regarding stem-cell based therapies to treat PD in the future. METHODS: Patients with PD were invited to complete a web-based discrete choice experiment to assess the importance of the following attributes: (i) type of treatment, (ii) aim of treatment, (iii) available knowledge of the different types of treatments, (iv) effect on symptoms, and (v) risk for severe side effects. Latent class conditional logistic regression models were used to determine preference estimates and heterogeneity in respondents' preferences. RESULTS: A substantial difference in respondents' preferences was observed in three latent preference patterns (classes). ""Effect on symptoms"" was the most important attribute in class 1, closely followed by ""type of treatment,"" with medications as preferred to other treatment alternatives. Effect on symptoms was also the most important attribute in class 2, with treatment with hESCs preferred over other treatment alternatives. Likewise for class 3, that mainly focused on ""type of treatment"" in the decision-making. Respondents' class membership was influenced by their experience in treatment, side effects, and advanced treatment therapy as well as religious beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the respondents would accept a treatment with products emanating from hESCs, regardless of views on the moral status of embryos. Preferences of patients with PD may provide guidance in clinical decision-making regarding treatments deriving from stem cells.",1
Acceptability and Feasibility of a Patient-Oriented Music Intervention to Reduce Pain in the Intensive Care Unit: Protocol for a Crossover Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Many patients experience pain in the intensive care unit (ICU) despite receiving pain medication. Research has shown that music can help reduce pain. Music interventions studied so far have not used music streaming to generate playlists based on patient preferences while incorporating recommended tempo and duration. Previous research has focused on postoperative ICU patients able to self-report, which is underrepresentative of the ICU population that might benefit from a music intervention for pain management. We developed a new patient-oriented music intervention (POMI) that incorporates features based on theoretical, empirical, and experiential data intended to be used in the ICU. Such a music intervention should consider the expertise of ICU patients, family members, and nursing staff, as well as the practicality of the intervention when used in practice. OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this study are to (1) evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the POMI to reduce pain in ICU patients and (2) evaluate the feasibility of conducting a crossover pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) for intervention testing in the ICU. A secondary objective is to examine the preliminary efficacy of the POMI to reduce pain in ICU patients. METHODS: A single-blind 2×2 crossover pilot RCT will be conducted. Patients will undergo 1 sequence of 2 interventions: the POMI which delivers music based on patients' preferences via headphones or music pillow for 20-30 minutes and the control intervention (headphones or pillow without music). The sequence of the interventions will be inverted with a 4-hour washout period. Timing of the interventions will be before a planned bed turning procedure. Each patient will undergo 1 session of music. Twenty-four patients will be recruited. Patients able to self-report (n=12), family members of patients unable to self-report (n=12), and nursing staff (n=12) involved in the bed turning procedure will be invited to complete a short questionnaire on the POMI acceptability. Data will be collected on the feasibility of the intervention delivery (ie, time spent creating a playlist, any issue related to headphones/pillow or music delivery, environmental noises, and intervention interruptions) and research methods (ie, number of patients screened, recruited, randomized, and included in the analysis). Pain scores will be obtained before and after intervention delivery. RESULTS: Recruitment and data collection began in March 2022. As of July 5, 2022, in total, 22 patients, 12 family members, and 11 nurses were recruited. CONCLUSIONS: Methodological limitations and strengths are discussed. Study limitations include the lack of blinding for patients able to self-report. Strengths include collecting data from various sources, getting a comprehensive evaluation of the intervention, and using a crossover pilot RCT design, where participants act as their own control, thus reducing confounding factors.

Is there a role for biomarkers in asymptomatic severe chronic primary mitral regurgitation?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common heart valve disease with a rising prevalence with the aging populations worldwide. The timing of surgical intervention in patients who have severe MR but remain asymptomatic is often debated. Herein we synthesize the latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and European Society of Cardiology/ European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (ESC/EACTS) heart valve guidelines in such patients and illustrate how circulating and/or imaging biomarkers can be used to help refine decision making algorithms. RECENT FINDINGS: The approach to decision making and strength of guideline recommendations in patients with asymptomatic stage C1 (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] > 60% and left ventricular end systolic dimension [LVESD] < 40 mm) and stage C2 disease (LVEF ≤ 60% and/or LVESD ≥ 40 mm) are reviewed. While surgical intervention is clearly indicated in patients with stage C2 disease, a multifaceted approach that integrates repairability, expertise, sub-clinical evidence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and patient preferences is required to identify the optimal approach to surveillance vs. surgery. The role of imaging (3D echocardiography, contrast echocardiography, left ventricular global longitudinal strain, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging [CMR]) and circulating (natriuretic peptides) biomarkers in decision making is also reviewed. SUMMARY: The decision making around timing of intervention in chronic primary MR requires a personalized approach that is based on accurate assessments of severity of MR, LV dimensions, LV function, valve morphology/repairability, surgeon and center expertise, and patient wishes. Biomarkers hold promise in refining decision making.",0
Effect of neridronate on axial involvement in patients with spondyloarthritis when biologics are not possible. Results of a monocentric study.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aims to examine the potential effectiveness of intravenous neridronate (IVNer) on axial involvement in patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA) refractory to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) but not eligible for biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). METHOD: Patients with active SpA (BASDAI score ≥ 4) and active sacroiliitis (SI) on MRI (according to ASAS MRI definition), who were NSAID-insufficient responder/intolerant but not eligible for bDMARDs, were retrospectively recruited in a tertiary rheumatology centre between September 2015 and December 2021. IVNer (100 mg) was administered to the patients on days 1, 4, 7, and 10. Responses were evaluated 60 days after the last infusion as the median changes from the baseline of BASDAI and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain and there are improvements on MRI signs. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients (26 axial SpA, 3 enteropathic arthritis, and 9 axial psoriatic arthritis) were included [66% women, mean age ± SD: 38.0 ± 14.1 years, mean disease duration: 30.5 ± 49.5 months (range 1.0-298), 47% HLAB27+]. The reason for bDMARD ineligibility was concurrent solid tumors (n = 6) or hematological (n = 1) malignancy, comorbidities (n = 11), or patient preference (n = 20). Both median BASDAI [5.83 (4.2-8.33) versus 3.66 (1.1-6.85), p < 0.001] and VAS pain [7 (5.75-8.0) versus 3 (1.0-7.0), p < 0.0001] significantly decreased after IVNer. Of 28 available MRI at follow-up, we observed a complete (36%) or partial (39%) resolution of sacroiliitis or a persistent activity (25%). DISCUSSION: IVNer was effective in improving axial involvement in patients with SpA refractory to NSAIDs but not eligible for bDMARDs. IVNer can be considered as a potential alternative therapeutic option in selected settings.",0
"Short-term anti-TNF therapy with surgical closure versus anti-TNF therapy alone for Crohn's perianal fistulas (PISA-II): long-term outcomes of an international, multicentre patient preference, randomised controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: The PISA-II trial showed that short-term anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy followed by surgical closure induces radiological healing of perianal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease more frequently than anti-TNF therapy alone after 18 months. This study aimed to compare long-term outcomes of both treatment arms. METHODS: Follow-up data were collected from patients who participated in the PISA-II trial, an international patient preference randomised controlled trial. This multicentre trial was performed in nine hospitals in the Netherlands and one hospital in Italy. Patients with Crohn's disease above the age of 18 years with an active high perianal fistula and a single internal opening were asked to participate. Patients were allocated to anti-TNF therapy (intravenous infliximab, or subcutaneous adalimumab, at the discretion of the gastroenterologist) for one year, or surgical closure combined with 4-months anti-TNF therapy. Patients without a treatment preference were randomised (1:1) using random block randomisation (block sizes of six without stratification), and patients with a treatment preference were treated according to their preferred treatment arm. For the current follow-up study, data were collected until May 2022. Primary outcome was radiological healing on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including all participants with a MRI made less than 6 months ago at the time of data collection. Analysis was based on observed data. FINDINGS: Between September 14, 2013, and December 7, 2019, 94 patients were enrolled in the trial. Long-term follow-up data were available in 91 patients (36/38 (95%) anti-TNF + surgical closure, 55/56 (98%) anti-TNF). A total of 14/36 (39%) patients in the surgical closure arm were randomly assigned, which was not significantly different in the anti-TNF treatment arm (16/55 (29%) randomly assigned). Median follow-up was 5.7 years (interquartile range (IQR) 5-7). Radiological healing occurred significantly more often after anti-TNF + surgical closure (15/36 = 42% versus 10/55 = 18%; P = 0.014). Clinical closure was comparable (26/36 = 72% versus 34/55 = 62%; P = 0.18) in both groups. However, clinical closure in the surgical group was achieved with less re-interventions 4/26 (= 15%) versus 18/34 (= 53%), including (redo-)surgical closure procedures. Recurrences occurred in 0/25 (0%) patients with radiological healing versus 27/76 (36%) patients with clinical closure, sometime during follow-up. Anti-TNF trough levels were higher in patients with long-term clinical closure in both groups (P = 0.031 and P = 0.014). In 6/11 (55%) patients in the anti-TNF group with available trough levels, recurrences were diagnosed within three months of a drop under 3.5ug/ml. 36 patients stopped anti-TNF, after which 0/14 (0%) patients with radiological healing developed a recurrence and 9/22 (41%) with clinical closure. Self-rated (in)continence was comparable between groups, and 79% (60/76) of patients indicated comparable/improved continence after treatment. Decision-regret analysis showed that all (30/30) anti-TNF + surgical closure patients agreed or strongly agreed that surgery was the right decision versus 78% (36/46) in the anti-TNF arm. All surgical closure patients would go for the same treatment again, whereas this was 89% (41/46) in the anti-TNF arm. INTERPRETATION: This study confirmed that surgical closure should be considered in amenable patients with perianal fistulas and Crohn's disease as long-term outcomes were favourable, and that radiological healing should be the aim of treatment as recurrences only occurred in patients without radiological healing. In patients with complete MRI closure, anti-TNF could be safely stopped. FUNDING: None.",0
Cancer treatments touch a wide range of values that count for patients and other stakeholders: What are the implications for decision-making?,"BACKGROUND: Cancer rates and expenditures are increasing, resulting in debates on the exact value of this care. Perspectives on what exactly constitutes worthwhile values differ. This study aims to explore all values-elements regarding new oncological treatments for patients with cancer and all stakeholders involved and to assess their implications in different decision-making procedures. METHOD: Thirty-one individual in-depth interviews were conducted with different stakeholders to identify values within oncology. A focus group with seven experts was performed to explore its possible implications in decision-making procedures. RESULTS: The overarching themes of values identified were impact on daily life and future, costs for patients and loved ones, quality of life, impact on loved ones, societal impact and quality of treatments. The expert panel revealed that the extended exploration of values that matter to patients is deemed useful in patient-level decision-making, information provision, patient empowerment and support during and after treatment. For national reimbursement decisions, implications for the broad range of values seems less clear. CONCLUSION: Clinical values are not the only ones that matter to oncological patients and the stakeholders in the field. We found a much broader range of values. Proper recognition of values that count might add to patient-level decision-making, but implications for reimbursement decisions are less clear. The results could be useful to guide clinicians and policymakers when it comes to decision-making in oncology. Making more explicit which values counts for whom guarantees a more systematic approach to decision-making on all levels.",0
"Effectiveness of group arts therapies (art therapy, dance movement therapy and music therapy) compared to group counselling for diagnostically heterogeneous psychiatric community patients: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial in mental health ","BACKGROUND: Arts therapies are widely but inconsistently provided in community mental health. Whilst they are appealing to patients, evidence for their effectiveness is mixed. Trials to date have been limited to one art-form or diagnosis. Patients may hold strong preferences for or against an art-form whilst group therapies rely on heterogeneity to provide a range of learning experiences. This study will test whether manualised group arts therapies (art therapy, dance movement therapy and music therapy) are effective in reducing psychological distress for diagnostically heterogeneous patients in community mental health compared to active group counselling control. METHODS: A pragmatic multi-centre 2-arm randomised controlled superiority trial with health economic evaluation and nested process evaluation. Adults aged ≥ 18, living in the community with a primary diagnosis of psychosis, mood, or anxiety disorder will be invited to participate and provide written informed consent. Participants are eligible if they score ≥ 1.65 on the Global Severity Index of the Brief Symptom Inventory. Those eligible will view videos of arts therapies and be asked for their preference. Participants are randomised to either their preferred type of group arts therapy or counselling. Groups will run twice per week in a community venue for 20 weeks. Our primary outcome is symptom distress at the end of intervention. Secondary outcomes include observer-rated symptoms, social situation and quality of life. Data will be collected at baseline, post-intervention and 6 and 12 months post-intervention. Outcome assessors and trial statisticians will be blinded. Analysis will be intention-to-treat. Economic evaluation will assess the cost-effectiveness of group arts therapies. A nested process evaluation will consist of treatment fidelity analysis, exploratory analysis of group process measures and qualitative interviews with participants and therapists. DISCUSSION: This will be the first trial to account for patient preferences and diagnostic heterogeneity in group arts therapies. As with all group therapies, there are a number of logistical challenges to which we have had to further adapt due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the study will provide evidence as to whether there is an additive benefit or not to the use of the arts in group therapy in community mental health care.

Interpretation services used for non-English language speaking patients with head and neck cancer: Findings from a tertiary London cancer centre.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment for head and neck cancer (HNC) can lead to profound changes in swallowing function and nutrition. UK HNC standards recommend informational counselling is provided pre-treatment by the dietitian and speech and language therapist (SLT). Non-english speaking patients treated in English speaking countries have poorer treatment outcomes. UK guidance recommends all patients should have access to interpretation services where required. This audit aimed to investigate the language needs and utilisation of interpretation services for patients with HNC attending pre-treatment clinics. METHODS: A retrospective casenote audit over two-years (2021-2023) of all patients attending pre-treatment clinics in a centralised London cancer centre. Information was collected from electronic hospital records on demographics, disease/treatment characteristics, first language; categorised as English primary language (EPL), non-English primary language (NEPL) and interpretation requirements; formal (professional interpreters) or informal (patients friends/relatives). Data was processed and collated using Microsoft Excel (Version 2308). Descriptive statistics were conducted using Excel Analysis ToolPak. RESULTS: 408 patients were included. Most patients were male (67%), aged 61 ± 13 years. 18% (n = 74) had NEPL; 58 required interpretation services. Formal interpretation service was provided in 43% (n = 25), informal services in 33% (n = 19), and no service in 24% (n = 14). Non-adherence to formal services included lack of/inaccurate documentation of language needs, patient preference and lack of available interpreters. CONCLUSION: This audit indicated that barriers exist in utilising formal interpretation services. Future research should investigate how this can be optimised to ensure necessary language support is provided consistent with guidelines that promote equality, diversity, and inclusion.",0
No obvious effect on mortality from a patient choice reform expanding access to opioid disorder treatment - results from a natural experiment of policy change in Sweden.,"BACKGROUND: Opioid-related overdose deaths remain a common cause of death in many settings, and opioid maintenance treatment is evidence-based for the treatment of opioid use disorders. However, access to such treatment varies and is limited in many settings. METHODS: The present study examines the longitudinal effects of a regional patient choice reform which substantially increased availability to opioid maintenance treatment in one Swedish county, starting from 2014. A previous follow-up, limited in time, indicated a possible effect on mortality from this intervention, demonstrating a lower increase in overdose deaths than in counties without this reform. The present study follows overdose deaths through 2021, and compares the intervention county to the remaining parts in the country, using death certificate statistics from the national causes of death register. RESULTS: The present study does not demonstrate any significant difference in the development of overdose mortality in the county where this reform substantially expanded treatment access, compared to other counties in the country. CONCLUSIONS: The study underlines the importance to maintain extensive efforts against overdose deaths over and above the treatment of opioid use disorders, such as low-threshold provision of opioid antidotes or other interventions specifically addressing overdose risk behaviors.",0
Creating space to talk about patients' personal goals: experiences from primary care stakeholders.,"BACKGROUND: To address the many challenges health systems and communities face, primary care is constantly searching for new strategies to improve quality of care. One of the strategies is to focus on patients' personal goals to direct the care process. To adopt an explicit focus on patients' personal goals, actions at different levels are required. As a first step in this process, this study aims to explore the experiences of primary care stakeholders (i.e., scholars, primary care providers, and policy makers) and develop a comprehensive understanding on the idea 'putting patients' goals first'. This will help to formulate suggestions about what these actions should include. METHOD: In this study, 41 primary care stakeholders participating in six focus groups between January 2020 and September 2020, were recruited via maximal variation purposive sampling. Data collection was done through an open-ended semi-structured interview guide. Focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed following a phenomenological-hermeneutical philosophy of Lindseth and Norberg. RESULTS: All participants expressed a strong fundamental belief for putting patients' personal goals first. The primary care providers shared that they created space for patients' personal goals by letting them talk about their values and stories. They reported to integrate their medical expertise with patients' personal goals in order to develop a balanced relationship. In this context, they also talked about the importance of taking into account the perspectives of patients' significant others. Primary care providers also talked about how they used patients' personal goals as a guide in interprofessional collaboration. Scholars denoted that (future) care providers need more training to acquire competencies to discuss patients' personal goals. The providers and policy makers talked about organizational limitations in terms of time restrictions and the lack of registration systems to support a workflow oriented towards patients' personal goals. CONCLUSIONS: This study can be used to support the coherence of the development of different actions and strategies to get primary care stakeholders fully on board to support the adoption of patients' personal goals in care delivery at different levels. However, models of practice and policy plans are needed to work towards a person-centered integrated system.",0
Practice patterns in management of differentiated thyroid cancer since the 2014 British Thyroid Association (BTA) guidelines.,"BACKGROUND: The updated 2014 BTA guidelines emphasised a more conservative, risk adapted model for the management of low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). In comparison to historical approach of total thyroidectomy combined with radioactive iodine, treatment de-escalation is increasingly supported. AIMS: To evaluate the impact of the updated BTA guidelines on the management of DTC cases at regional UK centre. METHODS: All DTC patients were retrospectively identified from regional thyroid MDT database between Jan2009-Dec2020. Oncological treatment and clinico-pathological characteristics were analysed. RESULTS: 623 DTC cases were identified; 312 (247 female: 65 male) between 2009 and 2014 and 311 (225 female: 86 male) between 2015 and 2020. Median age is 48 years (range 16-85). By comparing pre- and post-2015 cohorts, there was a significant drop in total thyroidectomy (87.1% vs 76.8%, p = 0.001) and the use of radioactive iodine (RAI) (73.1% vs 62.1%, p = 0.003) in our post-2015 cohort. When histological adverse features were analysed, extra-thyroidal extension (4.2% vs 17.0%, p=< 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (31.4% vs 50.5%, p=<0.001) and multi-centricity (26.9% vs 43.4%, p = 0.001) were significantly increased in the post 2015 cohort. Nonetheless, total thyroidectomy (TT) remains the treatment choice for low risk T1/2 N0 M0 disease in 65.3% (124/190) in post-2015 cohort for several reasons. Reasons include adverse histological features (50.8%), benign indications (32.5%), contralateral nodules (11.7%), patient preference (2.5%), and diagnostic uncertainty (2.5%). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms a move towards a more conservative approach to patients with low-risk DTC in the UK, which is in keeping with the BTA 2014 guideline and international trends, but total thyroidectomy remains prevalent for low risk T1/2 N0 M0 disease for other reasons.",0
"Two Methods, One Story? Comparing Results of a Choice Experiment and Multidimensional Thresholding From a Clinician Preference Study in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.","OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of methods are used to elicit health preference information. It is unclear whether different elicitation methods produce similar results and policy advice. Here, we compared the results from a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and multidimensional thresholding (MDT) that were conducted in the same sample. METHODS: Clinicians (N = 350) completed a DCE and MDT to elicit their preferences for 4 attributes related to the medical management of subarachnoid hemorrhage after aneurysm repair. Preference weights were compared between the DCE and MDT using a complete combinatorial convolution test. Additionally, data from the DCE and MDT were used to compute preference-based net treatment values for 16 hypothetical treatment profiles versus 1000 simulated comparators. The implied treatment recommendations were compared between the DCE and MDT. RESULTS: Preference weight distributions and median weights did not differ significantly between the DCE and MDT for any attribute: likelihood of delayed cerebral ischemia (medians 0.48 vs 0.40; P = .41), risk of lung complications (medians 0.27 vs 0.30; P = .52), risk of hypotension (medians 0.10 vs 0.11; P = .55), and risk of anemia (medians 0.07 vs 0.07; P = .50). The DCE and MDT produced similar treatment net value distributions (P > .05) and implied the same treatment recommendations in 82.3% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The DCE and MDT elicited similar preference distributions and produced the same treatment recommendations for most tested cases. However, the share of people supporting the average treatment recommendation differed. More research is needed to determine how these findings would compare with those in other populations (in particular, patients) and applications.",0
"Employees' preferences on organisational aspects of psychotherapeutic consultation at work by occupational area, company size, requirement levels and supervisor function - a cross-sectional study in Germany.","BACKGROUND: Common mental disorders affect a significant proportion of the population worldwide at any given time. Psychotherapeutic consultation at work offers employees with mental distress short-term and low-threshold access to psychotherapeutic treatment. However, this offer is only accepted by one to two percent of the employees to whom it is offered. Taking into account employees ' preferences regarding organisational aspects might increase the use of psychotherapeutic consultation at work. This study therefore aimed to identify preferences on organisational aspects of psychotherapeutic consultation at work among employees of diverse occupational areas, company sizes, supervisor functions and job requirement levels. METHODS: A total of 755 employees were recruited via advertisements on social media (Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn). Participants rated on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to different implementation options of psychotherapeutic consultation at work: type (in-person/video/telephone), location (on/outside company premises), time (within/outside working hours), scope (diagnostic/diagnostic + treatment) and purpose (private/occupational). Additionally, the maximum accepted distance to the location of consultation was assessed. Various analyses of variances (ANOVA) were conducted to determine differences in agreement to implementation options within each organisational aspect and to analyse differences between occupational areas, company sizes, requirement levels and between employees with and without supervisor function. RESULTS: Participants indicated a preference for in-person psychotherapeutic consultation that takes places outside company premises and outside working hours. Furthermore, they preferred offers including diagnostic and treatment sessions compared to offers including diagnostic sessions only. Even though participants agreed that consultation should be offered for all purposes, agreement for occupational issues was stronger than for private issues. For some implementation options, the level of agreement varied according to occupational field, company size, supervisor function and level of requirement. However, these differences did not affect the key findings mentioned above. CONCLUSION: Those findings give practical indications on the organisational design of psychotherapeutic consultation at work. The results suggest that in-person consultation outside company premises and working hours combining diagnostic and treatment sessions will be accepted by employees regardless of their occupational area, company size, supervisor function and requirement level.",0
Comparison of a full and partial choice set design in a labeled discrete choice experiment.,"Labeled discrete choice experiments (DCEs) commonly present all alternatives using a full choice set design (FCSD), which could impose a high cognitive burden on respondents. In the setting of employment preferences, this study explored if a partial choice set design (PCSD) reduced cognitive burden whilst maintaining convergent validity compared with a FCSD. Respondents' preferences between the two designs were investigated. In the experimental design, labeled utility functions were rewritten into a single generic utility function using label dummy variables to generate an efficient PCSD with 3 alternatives shown in each choice task (out of 6). The DCE was embedded in a nationwide survey of 790 Australian pharmacy degree holders where respondents were presented with both a block of FCSD and PCSD tasks in random order. The PCSD's impact on error variances was investigated using a heteroscedastic conditional logit model. The convergent validity of PCSD was based on the equality of willingness-to-forgo-expected-salary estimates from Willingness-to-pay-space mixed logit models. A nested logit model was used combined with respondents' qualitative responses to understand respondents' design preferences. We show a promising future use of PCSD by providing evidence that PCSD can reduce cognitive burden while satisfying convergent validity compared to FCSD.",1
"A cross-sectional study on factors influencing patient participation in undergraduate medical education in a public and private hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa.","BACKGROUND: The active involvement of patients in medical education is a common practice globally. Despite this, there is a global paucity of data on patients' views on their role in medical education. As such this study aimed to identify factors that influence patient participation in undergraduate medical education in public and private hospitals in Johannesburg. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted, using a 23-question, self-designed, paper questionnaire to collect data on patients' perceptions of student involvement in their care - with regard to consent, confidentiality, ethics, and patient preferences. Participants were recruited on a voluntary basis in the Departments of Medicine, Surgery, and Gynaecology, at selected hospital sites. Fisher's Exact and Chi-Square statistical tests were used where appropriate. RESULTS: Two hundred and one adult patients, comprised of 150 public sector patients and 51 private sector patients, completed the questionnaire. One hundred and sixty-nine patients (84,1%) were willing to participate in undergraduate medical education and no notable difference between these sectors was demonstrated (p = 0,41). The results further demonstrated that the main factors influencing patient participation in undergraduate medical education across both sectors were (1) the presence of a supervising professional, (2) the perceived degree of invasiveness of a procedure, and (3) the perceived expertise of the student. In addition, data across other key themes such as consent, confidentiality, ethics, and patient preferences and perceptions were elucidated. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the majority of inpatients across the public and private sectors are willing to participate in undergraduate medical education to facilitate the development of healthcare professionals. It also demonstrated that most patients have a positive experience. However, more measures of quality informed consent need to be instituted to optimise the current role of the South African public health sector, whilst facilitating the development of a similar role for the South African private sector in future clinical education. In addition, further research is necessary to evaluate these findings in a South African context.",0
Comparative efficacy of treatments for molluscum contagiosum: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Various interventions have been applied to treat molluscum contagiosum, but benefits and efficacy remain unclear. To assess the comparative efficacy and safety of interventions for molluscum contagiosum, a network meta-analysis was performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library were searched for articles published between January 1, 1990, and November 31, 2020. Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of interventions in immunocompetent children and adults with genital/non-genital molluscum contagiosum lesions. RESULTS: Twelve interventions from 25 RCTs including 2,123 participants were assessed. Compared with the placebo, ingenol mebutate had the most significant effect on complete clearance (odds ratio [OR] 117.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.37-2164.88), followed by cryotherapy (OR 16.81, 95% CI 4.13-68.54), podophyllotoxin (OR 10.24, 95% CI 3.36-31.21), and potassium hydroxide (KOH) (OR 10.02, 95% CI 4.64-21.64). Data on adverse effects were too scarce for quantitative synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Ingenol mebutate, cryotherapy, podophyllotoxin, and KOH were more effective than the other interventions in achieving complete clearance, but safety concerns regarding ingenol mebutate have recently been reported. Due to the possibility of spontaneous resolution, observation is also justified for asymptomatic infection. Factors including adverse effects, cost, patient preference, and medical accessibility should be considered.",0
Exercise Preferences in Young Adults with Cancer-The YOUEX Study.,"(1) Background: Strong evidence supports the persuasive positive effects of exercise for cancer patients and survivors. Different approaches of exercise programs have been established; however, the special interests of young adults (YAs) with cancer have rarely been considered in exercise interventions. Therefore, the study YOUng EXercisers (YOUEX) aimed to investigate exercise preferences in YAs. (2) Methods: YOUEX was a three-arm, patient preference-based non-randomized, longitudinal, pre-post exercise intervention, offering three different exercise modules to YAs during or after acute therapy (Module 1: online supervised group-based (M1); Module 2: online unsupervised (M2); Module 3: in-person supervised (M3)). The intervention period was 12 weeks with another 12-week follow-up period, the modules could be changed or amended after 6 and 12 weeks. (3) Results: 92 YAs were allocated to the study. At baseline, 50 YAs (54%) chose M2, 32 YAs (35%) M1 and 10 YAs (11%) M3. The analysis revealed high acceptability and feasibility of the online exercise programs (M1, M2). There was a high impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the execution of M3. YAs showed diverse preferences in module selection due to differences in, e.g., cancer therapy status or favored level of supervision. (4) Conclusions: YAs need personalized exercise programs that consider their individual interests and needs. Online exercise programs can be a promising addition to existing exercise opportunities. They are an effective way to increase physical activity levels in YAs.",0
"""It's Important to Work with People that Look Like Me"": Black Patients' Preferences for Patient-Provider Race Concordance.","A compelling body of research supports the race concordance hypothesis, which asserts that racially minoritized patients who share the same race and ethnicity with their provider have improved communication, better perceptions of care, and better health outcomes. Using a mixed methods approach, this study examined (1) the association between racial identity and patients' preference for race-concordant patient-provider dyads and (2) Black patients' subjective experiences of race concordance. Data were gathered from 47 Black caregivers who completed both a survey and participated in a focus group. Quantitative analyses revealed that the majority (83%) of caregivers reported that it is important to have a mental health provider of the same race and ethnicity. Greater racial centrality, but not private or public regard, was associated with a stronger race concordance preference. Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed six themes related to race-concordant preferences: aspects related to the patient care experience, cultural humility, relatability, diversity in cultural experiences, role models for children, and intersecting identities. Patients with a race concordance preference felt more comfortable with their provider, perceived that it was easier to build a rapport with their provider, and emphasized the value of representation for themselves and their children. Patients who were neutral in their race concordance preference emphasized professionalism over race, valued diverse perspectives, and appreciated their providers' cultural awareness and willingness to self-educate. The integration of these findings will help to elucidate a more nuanced understanding of the factors that build the therapeutic relationship and cultivate a framework of comfort and understanding in the clinical setting.",0
Women's perceptions of body mass graphics and their preferences for weight counselling.,"Health care providers may lack data-driven guidance about best practises for discussing weight. We assessed women's self-perception of body mass index (BMI) and preferences for weight counselling by provider characteristics and the initiating question. A voluntary, anonymous survey was completed by 756 women (age ≥ 19 year) at our tertiary care obstetrics and gynaecology clinics in autumn 2021. The respondents' height and weight were collected before respondents selected graphics from a validated Body Image Scale that they felt best represented their current body size and which graphs should prompt weight loss or gain recommendations. Respondents were asked their preferences about provider characteristics for discussion about weight and to identify which of six initiating questions from a provider was most and least preferred. Blank responses were allowed. In 708 responses, 366 women (52%) selected the most accurate graphic that corresponded to their BMI; the selected graphic represented a lower than actual BMI in 268 women (38%) and higher in 74 women (10%). In 648 responses, 374 women (58%) preferred a female provider, but provider body shape, ethnicity/race and age were not important to most women. The most preferred question to initiate a discussion about weight was ""A lot of women have trouble achieving or maintaining a healthy weight; is that something we can discuss?"" in 181 of 555 women (33%), and the least preferred question was ""Do you feel like you are at an appropriate weight?"" in 172 of 554 women (31%). Provider knowledge about patient preferences regarding questions may facilitate the discussion about weight.",0

Sleep Disorders and Aging in Women.,"Women of advancing age can suffer from an array of sleep disorders. We review the changes in sleep architecture, the impact of hormonal changes on sleep, and the various sleep disorders in women of advancing age. A focused history in this population should include the temporal relation to menopause and comorbid conditions. Treatment options should involve patient preference and review of current medications and comorbid conditions to optimize sleep in this population.",0
Addressing Patient Requests to Add Dietary Supplements to Their Cancer Care-A Suggested Approach.,"Dietary supplements are widely utilized by cancer patients as part of a complementary and integrative approach to their healthcare. However, a significant portion of patients refrain from discussing their supplement use with their physicians, often due to the perceived indifference or negativity of their healthcare providers. This communication gap exposes patients to unreliable information sources and potential risks associated with uninformed supplementation. As the healthcare landscape evolves, there is an increasing recognition of the pivotal role that physicians play in guiding patients' healthcare decisions. A patient-centered perspective prioritizes the provision of evidence-based information tailored to the individual's needs. It advocates for open discussions about potential risks and fosters shared decision making, respecting patient autonomy. Additionally, this approach involves offering alternative options, documenting patient preferences, and ensuring ongoing support while coordinating with the healthcare team. To address these evolving needs, healthcare providers must adopt a transformative perspective, becoming expert guides who engage with their patients as informed and empowered participants. This revised approach emphasizes an open dialogue that balances presenting facts and acknowledging uncertainties surrounding dietary supplement use. Our narrative review of the literature underscores the importance of a practical approach, centered on transparent discussions and respect for patient autonomy. By following this approach, healthcare providers can empower patients to navigate the complexities of dietary supplement use within the context of cancer care, thereby safeguarding patient safety and overall well-being. Notably, our proposed tool highlights the utilization of reliable sources, the risk stratification of supplements, specific recommendations, and subsequent monitoring, providing a structured framework for informed decision making.",0
Mothers' and birthing parents' experiences with 1-day cognitive behavioural therapy-based workshops for postpartum depression: A descriptive qualitative study.,"WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SUBJECT?: One in five mothers and birthing parents are affected by postpartum depression (PPD), yet only a small proportion of those with PPD receive treatment. Given cost and accessibility barriers to treatment, brief therapies (e.g. 1 day) could help address PPD on a large scale, though understanding participants' unique experiences with this novel treatment will help guide its refinement and use. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This paper describes the experiences, perspectives and satisfaction of participants who attended a 1-day workshop for PPD. Participants appreciate being taught practical techniques and the receipt of social support from facilitators and other attendees in the group setting, while some recommended further 'booster sessions' to enhance effectiveness. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: One-day CBT-based workshops may be an effective, low-intensity treatment option that provides helpful skills and builds social networks for individuals with PPD. Additional post-workshop booster sessions may enhance participant satisfaction with this new treatment by providing a reinforcement of their learning and an opportunity to re-connect with other birthing parents. ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Postpartum depression (PPD) affects up to one in five mothers and birthing parents. Understanding their perceptions of therapeutic interventions is key to their effectiveness and scalability. AIM: The aim of the study was to understand participants' experiences attending an in-person or online 1-day cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based workshop for PPD and compare their experiences participating in either modality. METHOD: This descriptive qualitative study was embedded in two separate randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of 1-day CBT-based workshops for PPD delivered in-person or online. Responses were provided by 94 in-person and 95 online participants about their experiences. Content analysis was used to code and categorize the data. RESULTS: Participants appreciated learning skills to improve PPD symptoms and joining a community of individuals with shared experiences. Integrating practical coping techniques after the workshop was reported to be most useful, though some wanted additional post-workshop support. Online participants identified additional barriers to workshop engagement. DISCUSSION: Participants who attended either workshop found them to be valuable and effective. Participants valued psychoeducation, social connections and applying practical CBT techniques. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: One-day CBT-based workshops may be an accessible treatment option for individuals with PPD, providing new skills and social support, though some prefer to receive additional post-workshop support.",0
Patient Preferences for Pharmacy Services: A Systematic Review of Studies Based on Discrete Choice Experiments.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In recent years, the mission of pharmacists has evolved and the model of the caregiver-patient relationship has been challenged by a new patient-centered approach. A challenge to providing personalized care is the assessment of patient preferences. We aimed to systematically identify published discrete choice experiments related to patient preferences for pharmacy services and to assess the quality of the selected articles. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted in two databases (PubMed and Embase, until March 2023) according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. The quality of the selected articles was assessed according to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research conjoint analysis checklist. RESULTS: Among the 421 articles identified, 16 published studies were included and analyzed. They were mostly published in pharmaceutical (n = 6), economic (n = 4), and public health (n = 4) journals. Only two articles concerned the field of hospital pharmacy. Only five presented the specific pharmacy service studied: filling of prescriptions, management of symptoms, treatment delivery, and components of pharmacist counseling. Five articles focused on pharmacy services related to a specific disease. None fully fulfilled the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research checklist, only partially fulfilled. CONCLUSIONS: According to the identified studies, cost, time, logistics (organizational criteria), and pharmacists' courtesy and skills were consistently cited as factors influencing patient preferences for pharmacy services. The disclosure of patient preferences is a complex and under-researched topic, especially in the field of pharmacy, but interest is growing. As the mission of pharmacists evolves to bring them closer to patients, the better understanding of patient preferences in pharmacy services will allow for better targeting and better integration of patient profiles in patient management.",1
Exploring Patient Adherence to Post-Surgical Follow-Up in Pelvic Endometriosis.,"Endometriosis is a significant cause of disability that affects 5-10% of reproductive-aged women. Laparoscopy with histological confirmation is the gold standard in establishing the diagnosis as therapeutic management surgery is addressed to a certain category of patients. The objective of this study was to assess patient adherence to follow-up after surgery for endometriosis as the primary endpoint, pain symptoms, quality of life, mental health, and fertility as the secondary endpoints. We have analyzed patients' adherence to follow-up after surgery for endometriosis after 1, 3, 5, and 7 years. Out of the 2538 total number of surgeries, 453 patients replied just to the first questionnaire (group A), 528 to the first and second (group B), and only 356 carried out the entire follow-up schedule. General health was significantly lower for group A (46.6 vs. 56.4) but with no statistical difference in the post-surgical improvement in both groups. Pain level score improvement was lower for group A (10.5 vs. 18.8), which is statistically significant. In this light, laparoscopy still remains the gold standard in diagnosis only. Furthermore, no malignancy was discovered. The mental component was improved by laparoscopy based on SF-36 in group B. Studies on patient preference for surgery versus alternative treatment are needed.",0
Treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism in patients under palliative care.,"Many patients with cancer require palliative care at some stage and the vast majority of people followed in palliative care are cancer patients. Patients with cancer are at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and this is particularly true during the advanced palliative phase when mobility is limited or absent. Patients with cancer in palliative cancer are at higher bleeding risk compared to non-cancer patients. Decisions to treat VTE or withhold anticoagulation for these patients have proven to be difficult and depend largely on an individual clinician's judgment. For this reason, we have developed a consensus proposal for appropriate management of cancer-associated thromboembolism (CAT) in patients in palliative care, which is presented in this article. The proposal was informed by the recent scientific literature retrieved through a systematic literature review. In cancer patients in advanced palliative care, the benefit-risk ratio of anticoagulation seems unfavourable with a higher haemorrhagic risk than the benefit associated with prevention of CAT recurrence and, above all, in the absence of any benefit on quality of life. For this reason, we recommend that patients should be prescribed anticoagulants on a case-by-case basis. The choice of whether to treat, and with which type of treatment, should take into account anticipated life expectancy and patient preferences, as well as clinical factors such as the estimated bleeding risk, the type of VTE experienced and the time since the VTE event.",0
Treatment patterns and outcomes among adults with immune thrombocytopenia receiving pharmaceutical second-line therapies: a retrospective cohort study using administrative claims data.,"OBJECTIVES: To describe and compare real-world treatment patterns and clinical outcomes among individuals with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) receiving second-line therapies (rituximab, romiplostim, or eltrombopag). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a large administrative claims database (January 2013-May 2020) among continuously enrolled patients ≥18 years prescribed second-line ITP therapies. The index date was the date of the first claim of the study medications. Treatment patterns and outcomes were measured during the 12-month follow-up period. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to balance covariates across treatment groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare treatment patterns and bleeding risk outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 695 patients were included (rituximab, N = 285; romiplostim, N = 212; eltrombopag, N = 198). After IPTW, all baseline covariates were balanced. Compared to eltrombopag, patients in the rituximab cohort were 57% more likely to receive other ITP therapies (systematic corticosteroids or third-line therapies) during the follow-up period (odds ratio [OR] = 1.571, p = .030). There was no significant difference in the odds of receiving a different second-line therapy or experiencing a bleeding-related episode among three groups (p > .050). Patients in the romiplostim cohort were 69% more likely to receive rescue therapy compared to those in the rituximab cohort (OR = 1.688, p = .025). CONCLUSION: Patients with ITP receiving rituximab were more likely to need other ITP therapies but did not experience higher risk of bleeding compared to those receiving eltrombopag or romiplostim. Benefits, risks, cost-effectiveness, and patient preference should all be considered in optimizing second-line therapy for ITP.",0
Self-administered stretching exercises are as effective as motor control exercises for people with chronic non-specific low back pain: a randomised trial.,"QUESTION: In people with chronic non-specific low back pain, what is the effect of self-administered stretching exercises relative to motor control exercises on pain intensity, disability, fear avoidance, global perceived effect and flexibility? DESIGN: Randomised trial with concealed allocation, intention-to-treat analysis and blinding of assessors. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred people with chronic non-specific low back pain. INTERVENTIONS: The self-stretching exercise group performed 6 stretches in 40-minute sessions. The motor control exercise group performed trunk stabilising exercises in 40-minute sessions. Both groups performed weekly supervised sessions for 8 weeks with one or more home sessions/week. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were pain intensity (0 to 10 scale) and disability (Oswestry Disability Index). The secondary outcomes were the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, global perceived effect, and the fingertip-to-floor test. Measures were taken at baseline and at 8, 13 and 26 weeks. RESULTS: On the 0 to 10 scale, the between-group difference in pain intensity was negligible, with a mean difference of roughly 0 (95% CI -1 to 1) at each time point. Similarly, the between-group difference on the 100-point disability scale was negligible: MD -1 (95% CI -3 to 1) at week 8, MD 1 (95% CI -1 to 3) at week 13 and MD 0 (95% CI -1 to 2) at week 26. The two interventions also had similar effects on the secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: In people with chronic non-specific low back pain, self-stretching exercises had very similar effects to motor control exercises on pain intensity, disability, fear avoidance, global perceived effect and flexibility up to 18 weeks beyond the end of an 8-week program. Given the established effectiveness of motor control exercises, either intervention could be recommended to people with chronic low back pain. The choice of intervention might be directed by patient preference. REGISTRATION: NCT03128801.",0
QALY-type preference and willingness-to-pay among end-of-life patients with cancer treatments: a pilot study using discrete choice experiment.,"PURPOSE: Quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a dominant measurement of health gain in economic evaluations for pricing drugs. However, end-of-life (EoL) patients' preference for QALY gains in life expectancy (LE) and quality of life (QoL) during different disease stages remains unknown and is seldom involved in decision-making. This study aims to measure preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) towards different types of QALY gain among EoL cancer patients. METHODS: We attributed QALY gain to four types, gain in LE and QoL, respectively, and during both progression-free survival (PFS) and post-progression survival (PPS). A discrete choice experiment including five attributes (the four QALY attributes and one cost attribute) with three levels each was developed and conducted with 85 Chinese advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients in 2022. All levels were set with QALY gain/cost synthesised from research on anti-lung cancer drugs recently listed by Chinese National Healthcare Security Administration. Each respondent answered six choice tasks in a face-to-face interview. The data were analysed using mixed logit models. RESULTS: Patients valued LE-related QALY gain in PFS most, with a relative importance of 81.8% and a WTP of $43,160 [95% CI 26,751 ~ 59,569] per QALY gain. Respondents consistently preferred LE-related to QoL-related QALY gain regardless of disease stage. Patients with higher income or lower education levels tended to pay more for QoL-related QALY gain. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a prioritised resource allocation to EoL-prolonging health technologies. Given the small sample size and large individual heterogeneity, a full-scale study is needed to provide more robust results.",1
MK-0616: an oral PCSK9 inhibitor for hypercholesterolemia treatment.,"INTRODUCTION: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lowering LDL-cholesterol, by lifestyle modification or therapeutically, reduces the risk of ASCVD. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a protein which binds to the LDL-receptor and induces degradation, is a clinically validated target to lower LDL-cholesterol. Injectable PCSK9 inhibitor therapies have demonstrated substantial reductions in LDL-cholesterol with associated decreased risk of ASCVD events. AREAS COVERED: MK-0616 is an orally bioavailable, renally excreted, macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of PCSK9. The article provides an understanding of the chemistry and development, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of MK-0616 and insight into its clinical efficacy and safety. In clinical trials, MK-0616 produced dose-dependent reductions in LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein (apo) B levels. Furthermore, MK-0616 modestly lowered lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)]. EXPERT OPINION: MK-0616 is a potent, oral macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of PCSK9 that is not only able to reduce LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol, and apoB, but can also lower Lp(a). Safety and tolerability studies reported to date are promising. MK-0616 may offer advantages over injectable anti-PCSK9 therapies in terms of ease of dosing, patient preference and cost. The results from phase III trials of MK-0616 on cardiovascular outcomes are awaited with interest.",0
"Immunotherapy, Chemotherapy, or Both: Options for First-Line Therapy for Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.","The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice.The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the management of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). The landmark KEYNOTE-048 clinical trial established the programmed death-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab with and without chemotherapy as a new standard first-line treatment for patients with platinum-sensitive R/M HNSCC. Nonetheless, clinical decision making can be challenging when considering the significant morbidity associated with rapidly progressive disease in high-risk locations, patient fitness, and programmed death-ligand 1 expression. Both planned and unplanned subgroup analyses from KEYNOTE-048 provide valuable insights into how therapy for untreated R/M HNSCC may be optimized for individual patients. Given differences in the toxicity profile of pembrolizumab alone versus in combination with chemotherapy, prioritizing patient preference is paramount in this palliative treatment setting. Here, the case of a patient presenting with de novo metastatic HNSCC is discussed to highlight the practical application of KEYNOTE-048 data in clinical practice.",0
Studying How Patient Engagement Influences Research: A Mixed Methods Study.,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence supporting the value of patient engagement (PE) in research to patients and researchers. However, there is little research evidence on the influence of PE throughout the entire research process as well as the outcomes of research engagement. The purpose of our study is to add to this evidence. METHODS: We used a convergent mixed method design to guide the integration of our survey data and observation data to assess the influence of PE in two groups, comprising patient research partners (PRPs), clinicians, and researchers. A PRP led one group (PLG) and an academic researcher led the other (RLG). Both groups were given the same research question and tasked to design and conduct an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related patient preference study. We administered validated evaluation tools at three points and observed PE in the two groups conducting the IBD study. RESULTS: PRPs in both groups took on many operational roles and influenced all stages of the IBD-related qualitative study: launch, design, implementation, and knowledge translation. PRPs provided more clarity on the study design, target population, inclusion-exclusion criteria, data collection approach, and the results. PRPs helped operationalize the project question, develop study material and data collection instruments, collect data, and present the data in a relevant and understandable manner to the patient community. The synergy of collaborative partnership resulted in two projects that were patient-centered, meaningful, understandable, legitimate, rigorous, adaptable, feasible, ethical and transparent, timely, and sustainable. CONCLUSION: Collaborative and meaningful engagement of patients and researchers can influence all stages of qualitative research including design and approach, and outputs.",0
A Narrative Synthesis of Literature on the Barriers to Timely Diagnosis and Treatment of Cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa.,"Poor cancer survival outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have been linked to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Here we present a detailed overview of the qualitative literature evaluating the barriers to receiving timely diagnosis and treatment of cancer in SSA. The PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO databases were searched to identify qualitative studies reporting on barriers to timely diagnosis of cancer in SSA published between 1995 and 2020. A systematic review methodology was applied, including quality assessment and narrative data synthesis. We identified 39 studies, of which 24 focused on breast or cervical cancer. Only one study focused on prostate cancer and one on lung cancer. When exploring factors contributing to delays, six key themes emerged from the data. The first theme was health service barriers, which included: (i) inadequate numbers of trained specialists; (ii) limited knowledge of cancer among healthcare providers; (iii) poor co-ordination of care; (iv) inadequately resourced health facilities; (v) negative attitudes of healthcare providers towards patients; (vi) high cost of diagnostic and treatment services. The second key theme was patient preference for complementary and alternative medicine; the third was the limited understanding of cancer among the population. The fourth barrier was a patient's personal and family obligations; the fifth was the perceived impact of cancer and its treatment on sexuality, body image and relationships. Finally, the sixth was the stigma and discrimination faced by patients following a diagnosis of cancer. In conclusion, health system, patient level and societal factors all influence the likelihood of timely diagnosis and treatment for cancer in SSA. The results provide a focus for targeting health system interventions, particular with regards to awareness and understanding of cancer in the region.",0
Insomnia and related mental health conditions: Essential neurobiological underpinnings towards reduced polypharmacy utilization rates.,"Insomnia represents a significant public health burden, with a 10% prevalence in the general population. Reduced sleep affects social and working functioning, productivity, and patient's quality of life, leading to a total of $100 billion per year in direct and indirect healthcare costs. Primary insomnia is unrelated to any other mental or medical illness; secondary insomnia co-occurs with other underlying medical, iatrogenic, or mental conditions. Epidemiological studies found a 40-50% comorbidity prevalence between insomnia and psychiatric disorders, suggesting a high relevance of mental health in insomniacs. Sleep disturbances also worsen the outcomes of several psychiatric disorders, leading to more severe psychopathology and incomplete remission, plausibly contributing to treatment-resistant conditions. Insomnia and psychiatric disorder coexistence can lead to polypharmacy, namely, the concurrent use of two or more medications in the same patient, regardless of their purpose or rationale. Polypharmacy increases the risk of using unnecessary drugs, the likelihood of drug interactions and adverse events, and reduces the patient's compliance due to regimen complexity. The workup of insomnia must consider the patient's sleep habits and inquire about any medical and mental concurrent conditions that must be handled to allow insomnia to be remitted adequately. Monotherapy or limited polypharmacy should be preferred, especially in case of multiple comorbidities, promoting multipurpose molecules with sedative properties and with bedtime administration. Also, non-pharmacological interventions for insomnia, such as sleep hygiene, relaxation training and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy may be useful in secondary insomnia to confront behaviors and thoughts contributing to insomnia and help optimizing the pharmacotherapy. However, insomnia therapy should always be patient-tailored, considering drug indications, contraindications, and pharmacokinetics, besides insomnia phenotype, clinical picture, patient preferences, and side effect profile.",0
A Quantitative Framework for Medication Non-Adherence: Integrating Patient Treatment Expectations and Preferences.,"INTRODUCTION: Medication non-adherence remains a significant challenge in healthcare, impacting treatment outcomes and the overall effectiveness of medical interventions. This article introduces a novel approach to understanding and predicting medication non-adherence by integrating patient beliefs, efficacy expectations, and perceived costs. Existing theoretical models often fall short in quantifying the impact of barrier removal on medication adherence and struggle to address cases where patients consciously choose not to follow prescribed medication regimens. In response to these limitations, this study presents an empirical framework that seeks to provide a quantifiable model for both individual and population-level prediction of non-adherence under different scenarios. METHODS: We present an empirical framework that includes a health production function, specifically applied to antihypertensive medications nonadherence. Data collection involved a pilot study that utilized a double-bound contingent-belief (DBCB) questionnaire. Through this questionnaire, participants could express how efficacy and side effects were affected by controlled levels of non-adherence, allowing for the estimation of sensitivity in health outcomes and costs. RESULTS: Parameters derived from the DBCB questionnaire revealed that on average, patients with hypertension anticipated that treatment efficacy was less sensitive to non-adherence than side effects. Our derived health production function suggests that patients may strategically manage adherence to minimize side effects, without compromising efficacy. Patients' inclination to manage medication intake is closely linked to the relative importance they assign to treatment efficacy and side effects. Model outcomes indicate that patients opt for full adherence when efficacy outweighs side effects. Our findings also indicated an association between income and patient expectations regarding the health of antihypertensive medications. CONCLUSION: Our framework represents a pioneering effort to quantitatively link non-adherence to patient preferences. Preliminary results from our pilot study of patients with hypertension suggest that the framework offers a viable alternative for evaluating the potential impact of interventions on treatment adherence.",0
Post-operative Surveillance Following Curative Resection of Colorectal Cancer in the Elderly Population in the United Kingdom: An Observational Study.,"Background Colorectal cancer most commonly affects the elderly population. Post-colorectal cancer surveillance aims to reduce cancer incidence and mortality, but its necessity and effectiveness are debated, especially in the elderly population. This study explores the relevance of computer tomography (CT) and colonoscopy surveillance in patients aged 75 and over who have undergone curative resection for colorectal cancer. Methods A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted on patients aged 75 and over who had undergone surgical resection of colorectal cancer between November 2014 and August 2021. Data on demographics, treatment, survival, and surveillance were gathered from electronic patient records. The primary outcome was adherence to follow-up colonoscopy and CT-scan surveillance following surgery. Results A total of 417 patients underwent colorectal cancer surgery, with 334 included for analysis. The cohort had an average age of 81 years, with the majority receiving laparoscopic surgery and primary anastomosis. Twelve-month CT surveillance showed normal results in 281 patients (91.8%), while 24-month CT surveillance demonstrated normal findings in 244 patients (88.7%). Only 175 patients (52.4%) had colonoscopy follow-up, with 94 (53.7%) showing normal results, 74 (42.3%) demonstrating benign polyps, and two patients (1.1%) having histologically proven cancer. Reasons for not undergoing colonoscopy included declining invitations (30 patients, 19.1%) and being too frail (45 patients, 28.7%). Conclusion This study reinforces the notion that colonoscopy surveillance for patients over the age of 75 may have limited benefits. In an ageing population, the benefits of surveillance in terms of early detection of recurrence must be balanced against the risks of harm from the procedure, the availability of further management, cost-effectiveness, and patient preferences. An individualised approach should be adopted, potentially with colonoscopy surveillance only recommended in patients of higher risk (extramural venous invasion (EMVI)) and a low frailty score with a life expectancy over 10 years.",0
Long-term outcomes after plaque excision grafting for Peyronie's disease and subanalysis of patients who undergo the procedure despite preoperative counseling against it.,"BACKGROUND: Plaque excision and grafting (PEG) has been recommended for patients with Peyronie's disease (PD) with >60° curvature and/or hinge effect and strong preoperative erections, while placement of an inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) is recommended when rigidity is suboptimal. Nevertheless, many patients counseled to undergo an IPP decline and insist on proceeding with PEG due to personal preference or desire to avoid an implant. AIM: We aim to review long-term outcomes in patients who underwent PEG for PD at our institution and investigate whether there is any difference in long-term outcomes in patients who undergo PEG despite a recommendation to undergo IPP. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review from 2007 to 2021 on PEG surgery performed at a single tertiary care institution in patients ≥18 years old who had >3 months of follow-up. OUTCOMES: Postoperative information was gathered from the electronic medical record, including postoperative erectile function, patient satisfaction, and the ability to engage in penetrative sexual intercourse. RESULTS: An overall 251 patients underwent PEG with a median follow-up of 12 months (IQR, 6-54). Among these, 54 (22%) were initially advised to undergo IPP but elected for PEG. Patients who underwent PEG despite counseling to undergo IPP reported lower postoperative ability to engage in intercourse (51% vs 76%). Seven (13%) patients initially advised to undergo IPP eventually received an IPP, relative to 7 (4%) initially advised to undergo PEG. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Thorough preoperative assessment of erectile function and penile deformity can guide clinician counseling and manage patient expectations during decision making between PEG surgery and IPP implantation for PD. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature, high attrition to follow-up, and risk of recall and selection bias. This is a large study with a median follow-up of 12 months, with a high-volume single surgeon who treats patients in a specialized population of complex cases. CONCLUSION: Patients who were initially counseled to undergo IPP due to suboptimal erectile rigidity but elected for PEG had worse postoperative ability to engage in penetrative intercourse, and a higher proportion of these patients eventually received an IPP.",0
"Latinx attitudes, barriers, and experiences with genetic counseling and testing: A systematic review.","As genetics is increasingly used across clinical settings, there is a need to understand the impact and experiences of diverse patients. This review systematically examined research literature on Latinx experiences with genetic counseling and genetic testing (GC/GT) in the United States, synthesizing key themes and knowledge gaps pertaining to both patient experience and hypothetical scenarios. Findings were based on a systematic search, inclusion, and thematic analysis of 81 empirical peer-reviewed articles published from January 1990 to July 2019 pertaining to Latinx populations and GC/GT. Studies most commonly addressed Latinas' perspectives on GC/GT in prenatal settings or for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Costs, referrals, and communication were significant barriers to accessing genetic services for many Latinx patients, particularly those with low English proficiency (LEP). Studies highlighted difficulties accessing and communicating in healthcare settings, and how medical context and prior experience with healthcare workers and institutions influenced GC/GT decision-making. Providers' implicit biases about Latinx patients negatively impacted their care and impeded communication. Despite low awareness of cancer GT, Latinx patients often reported interest in learning more about GC/GT or unmet needs for GT discussion and provider involvement. This systematic review identified areas where providers can take action to improve Latinx experiences with GC/GT. Clinicians should elicit and respond to patient preferences about shared decision-making. For patients with low numeracy or LEP, providers should consider tailored educational and communication techniques. Most studies focused on HBOC and prenatal testing, and Latinx patients are heterogeneous, leaving many research questions about Latinx experience with GT/GC in other clinical areas.",0
Understanding depression treatment and perinatal service preferences of Kenyan pregnant adolescents: A discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding mental health treatment preferences of adolescents and youth is particularly important for interventions to be acceptable and successful. Person-centered care mandates empowering individuals to take charge of their own health rather than being passive recipients of services. METHODS: We conducted a discrete choice experiment to quantitatively measure adolescent treatment preferences for different care characteristics and explore tradeoffs between these. A total of 153 pregnant adolescents were recruited from two primary healthcare facilities in the informal urban settlement of Nairobi. We selected eight attributes of depression treatment option models drawn from literature review and previous qualitative work. Bayesian d-efficient design was used to identify main effects. A total of ten choice tasks were solicited per respondent. We evaluated mean preferences using mixed logit models to adjust for within subject correlation and account for unobserved heterogeneity. RESULTS: Respondents showed a positive preference that caregivers be provided with information sheets, as opposed to co-participation with caregivers. With regards to treatment options, the respondents showed a positive preference for 8 sessions as compared to 4 sessions. With regards to intervention delivery agents, the respondents had a positive preference for facility nurses as compared to community health volunteers. In terms of support, the respondents showed positive preference for parenting skills as compared to peer support. Our respondents expressed negative preferences of ANC service combined with older mothers as compared to adolescent friendly services and of being offered refreshments alone. A positive preference was revealed for combined refreshments and travel allowance over travel allowance or refreshments alone. A number of these suggestions were about enhancing their experience of maternity clinical care experience. CONCLUSION: This study highlights unique needs of this population. Pregnant adolescents' value responsive maternity and depression care services offered by nurses. Participants shared preference for longer psychotherapy sessions and their preference was to have adolescent centered maternal mental health and child health services within primary care.",1
"A Randomized, Open-label, Cross-over Phase 2 Trial of Darolutamide and Enzalutamide in Men with Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic Metastatic Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer: Patient Preference and Cognitive Function in ODENZA.","BACKGROUND: Darolutamide and enzalutamide are second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors with activity in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and different toxicity profiles. OBJECTIVE: ODENZA is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, cross-over, phase 2 trial designed to assess preference between darolutamide and enzalutamide in men with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC (mCRPC). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either darolutamide 1200 mg/d for 12 wk followed by enzalutamide 160 mg/d for 12 wk or enzalutamide followed by darolutamide. In both arms, the second treatment was given in absence of cancer progression. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was patient preference between the two drugs, as assessed by a preference questionnaire (p value calculated with the Prescott test). After week 24, patients entered an extension period during which they received their preferred treatment until progression or toxicity. The main secondary objectives included reasons for patient preference, response at week 12, tolerance of each drug, and measurement compared with baseline of cognitive outcomes assessed using tablet questionnaires. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 249 patients, with a median age of 72 yr, were randomized. Among the 200 patients who fulfilled the preplanned criteria for the evaluation of the primary endpoint of preference, 97 (49% [41; 56]), 80 (40% [33; 47]), and 23 (12% [7; 16]) chose darolutamide, chose enzalutamide, and had no preference, respectively (p = 0.92). Reduced fatigue, easier administration, and better quality of life were the main criteria that influenced patient choice. A moderate benefit in episodic memory from darolutamide was observed for the acquisition of new information (least square [LS] means difference = 2.2, effect size = 0.5) and for the recall of that information after a brief delay (LS means difference = 0.7, effect size = 0.3). Using the Brief Fatigue Inventory questionnaire, patients reported greater fatigue with enzalutamide (3.3 [3.0; 3.6]) than with darolutamide (2.7 [2.4; 3.0]). There was no difference in terms of depression, seizures, and falls. CONCLUSIONS: The study did not show a difference in preference between the two treatments. In men with mCRPC, darolutamide was associated with a clinically meaningful benefit in episodic memory and less fatigue compared with enzalutamide. PATIENT SUMMARY: Preference between darolutamide and enzalutamide was well balanced in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Darolutamide was associated with a significant benefit in verbal learning and less fatigue compared with enzalutamide.",0
Interrelationship between dental clinicians and laboratory technicians: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Effective communication among members of the dental team is essential for the delivery of high-quality dental care. However, an in-depth understanding of issues concerning the interrelationship between dental clinicians and laboratory technicians has not been previously undertaken. Therefore, the aim of the study was to explore factors influencing the interrelationship between dental clinicians and laboratory technicians. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with dental clinicians and laboratory technicians using purposeful snowball sampling. Two trained researchers conducted the interviews based on a pre-piloted topic guide. The interviews were conducted via video conferencing platform, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Field notes were taken during the interviews. Framework Methodology was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 20 dental clinicians and laboratory technicians were interviewed. The average interview duration was 37 min. Participants mainly reported negative encounters and highlighted the importance of training and exposure, collaborative learning, and alignment of expectations of both parties in terms of cost of laboratory work, turnaround time, and patient preferences. The relationship between dental clinicians and laboratory technicians depends largely on effective teamwork dynamics and open communication channels. Increased workload, workforce shortage, availability of digital systems, management policies, and financial challenges were emphasized as organizational factors affecting the interrelationship between both groups. Participants highlighted the importance of shadowing, mentorship, education courses, joint discussions, patient-technician rapport, and adoption of digital technology for fostering collaborative practices between the professions. CONCLUSIONS: A multitude of factors influencing the dental clinician-laboratory interrelationship at individual, interpersonal and organizational levels were identified. This study highlights the need to build a transformative relationship underpinned by mutual trust and respect. Such a collaborative relationship will facilitate optimal patient care and successful treatment outcomes. The outcome of this study can help stakeholders identify solutions for enhancing the interrelationship among the dental team, to ultimately improve patient care and efficiency of dental services.",0
Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of active Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy in persons with diabetes mellitus (IWGDF 2023).,"The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence-based guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease since 1999. This is the first guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of active Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy in persons with diabetes published by the IWGDF. We followed the GRADE Methodology to devise clinical questions in the PACO (Population, Assessment, Comparison, Outcome) and PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) format, conducted a systematic review of the medical literature, and developed recommendations with the rationale. The recommendations are based on the evidence from our systematic review, expert opinion when evidence was not available, and also taking into account weighing of the benefits and harms, patient preferences, feasibility and applicability, and costs related to an intervention. We here present the 2023 Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of active Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy in persons with diabetes mellitus and also suggest key future topics of research.",0
Association of Open Reduction and Internal Fixation With Volar Locking Plate for Distal Radius Fractures With Patient-Reported Outcomes in Older Adults: A Network Meta-analysis.,"IMPORTANCE: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have reported inconsistent conclusions regarding optimal distal radius fracture (DRF) treatment in older adults and are limited due to the inclusion of cohort studies with small sample sizes. A network meta-analysis (NMA) addresses these limitations by only synthesizing direct and indirect evidence from RCTs and may clarify optimal DRF treatment in older adults. OBJECTIVE: To examine DRF treatment results in optimal short-term and intermediate-term patient-reported outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were conducted for RCTs that investigated DRF treatment outcomes in older adults between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2022. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials including patients with a mean age of 50 years or older that compared the following DRF treatments were eligible for inclusion: casting, open reduction and internal fixation with volar lock plating (ORIF), external fixation, percutaneous pinning, and nail fixation. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently completed all data extraction. An NMA aggregated all direct and indirect evidence among DRF treatments. Treatments were ranked by surface under the cumulative ranking curve score. Data are reported as standard mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was short-term (≤3 months) and intermediate-term (>3 months to 1 year) Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire scores. Secondary outcomes included Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) scores and 1-year complication rates. RESULTS: In this NMA, 23 RCTs consisting of 3054 participants (2495 women [81.7%]) with a mean (SD) age of 66 (7.8) years were included. At 3 months, DASH scores were significantly lower for nail fixation (SMD, -18.28; 95% CI, -29.93 to -6.63) and ORIF (SMD, -9.28; 95% CI, -13.90 to -4.66) compared with casting. The PRWE scores were also significantly lower for ORIF (SMD, -9.55; 95% CI, -15.31 to -3.79) at 3 months. In the intermediate term, ORIF was associated with lowered DASH (SMD, -3.35; 95% CI, -5.90 to -0.80) and PRWE (SMD, -2.90; 95% CI, -4.86 to -0.94) scores. One-year complication rates were comparable among all treatments. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this NMA suggest that ORIF may be associated with clinically significant improvements in short-term recovery compared with casting for multiple patient-reported outcomes measures with no increase in 1-year complication rates. Shared decision-making with patients may be useful to identify patient preferences regarding recovery to determine optimal treatment.",0
Rapid implementation of remote digital primary care in Stockholm and implications for further system-wide implementation: practitioner's and manager's experience of the Always Open mobile application.,"OBJECTIVE: To contribute actionable knowledge how to increase appropriate use of digital technologies in primary care by understanding clinical managers experiences with a digital connection system, Always Open, during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: The overall design was a qualitative study with directed content analysis method. Data were collected from documents and focus group (n = 12) interviews with clinical managers (n = 99) of primary care. The seven domains of the Non-adoption, Abandonment, and challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) framework was used to understand the implementation process, as described by the clinical managers. RESULTS: Focus group participants reported that their units made their own local decisions to make more use of the technology provided by the health system. Most participants considered that the technology was ready to use, despite some limitations, that included individual clinician's and patient preferences, and how ready their unit was for making changes to practice and organization. Some raised concerns about how standardizing some aspects possibly conflicted with the decentralized management model of the organization. The overall experience was reported to be positive, with an intention to sustain the achievements. CONCLUSION: Focus group interviews found that clinical unit managers reported that they and their staff were positive about the digital technology system for remote care. For the future, they wanted changes to be made at different levels of the health system to better combine digital and physical care. Possibilities to use digital technology to integrate primary and hospital health care were identified.",0
ECCO Topical Review on Biological Treatment Cycles in Crohn's Disease.,"There are now a growing number of licensed biological therapies for patients with Crohn's disease. However, there can be significant costs associated with long-term maintenance treatment, as well as some concerns about potential side-effects. As a result, there has been increasing interest in elective biological treatment discontinuation in selected patients, after a sustained period of remission. Following discontinuation, in cases of relapse, evidence to date has suggested that remission may often be regained by re-treatment with the same biological agent. Therefore, a concept has emerged in which cycles of biological therapy might be used. If this treatment strategy were to be applied in a subgroup of patients at low risk of relapse, cycling might allow a substantial number of patients to have a lower, overall therapeutic burden-ensuring decreased exposure to biological therapy but still enabling appropriate disease control. Currently, there remains uncertainty about the benefit-risk balance for using cycles of biological treatment for patients with Crohn's disease. Accordingly, an expert panel was convened by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [ECCO] to review the published literature and agree a series of consensus practice points. The panel aimed to provide evidence-based guidance on multiple aspects of biological treatment discontinuation and cycling, including the risk of relapse after elective treatment discontinuation, predictors of probable relapse or remission, safety, patient preferences, and pharmacoeconomic aspects. Crucially, discussions about biological treatment discontinuation and cycling should be individualized, to enable shared decision-making by patients with their clinicians.",0
Incorporating Prior Data in Quantitative Benefit-Risk Assessments: Case Study of a Bayesian Method.,"BACKGROUND: Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) in their current implementation cannot incorporate prior or external information on benefits and risks. We demonstrate how to incorporate prior data using a Bayesian mixture model approach while conducting quantitative benefit-risk assessments (qBRA) for medical products. METHODS: We implemented MCDA and SMAA in a Bayesian framework. To incorporate information from a prior study, we use mixture priors on each benefit and risk attribute that mixes information from a previous study with a vague prior distribution. The degree of borrowing is varied using a mixing proportion parameter. RESULTS: A demonstration case study for qBRA using the supplementary New Drug Application (sNDA) filing for Rivaroxaban for the indication of reduction in the risk of major thrombotic vascular events in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) was used to illustrate the method. Net utility scores, obtained from the randomized controlled trial data to support the sNDA, from the MCDA for Rivaraxoban and comparator were 0.48 and 0.56, respectively, with Rivaroxaban being the preferred alternative only 33% of the time. We show that with only 30% borrowing from a previous RCT, the MCDA and SMAA results are favorable for Rivaroxaban, accounting for the seemingly aberrant results on all-cause death in the trial data used to support the sNDA. CONCLUSION: Our method to formally incorporate prior data in MCDA and SMAA is easy to use and interpret. Software in the form of an RShiny App is available here: https://sai-dharmarajan.shinyapps.io/BayesianMCDA_SMAA/ .",1
Factors influencing gender preference towards surgeons among Jordanian adults: an investigation of healthcare bias.,"Studies investigating gender bias against female surgeons yielded conflicting results ranging from neutrality to a clear preference towards male surgeons. Yet, such bias remains understudied within Middle Eastern nations. We aimed to assess preferences of surgeons' gender among Jordanians and explore reasons for possible gender bias across different surgical specialties. A total of 1708 respondents were examined using a cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire to evaluate the gender preferences of surgeons, characteristics associated with preferred surgeon's gender, and surgeon's preference in certain specialties. Nearly 52.0% of participants had no gender preference for surgeons. Among those with a preference, 75.7% preferred male surgeons while 24.3% preferred female surgeons. Reputation, knowledge, and experience were the most important factors when choosing a surgeon. Male surgeons were viewed as more trustworthy, knowledgeable, experienced, and communicative. Female surgeons were dominantly perceived as more compassionate, cooperative, and prone to listen. Male respondents were 5 times more likely to choose a surgeon of similar gender (OR 5.687; CI 3.791-8.531). Male surgeons were favored for cardiovascular and orthopedic surgeries. Similarly, female surgeons were favored in gynecological and obstetric surgeries, plastic surgeries, and breast surgeries. Female gender (OR 6.193; CI 4.077-9.408), living outside Amman (OR 1.517; CI 1.066-2.160), and being married (OR 2.504; CI 1.601-3.917) were all significant positive predictors of preferring female surgeons. Our findings highlight differences in gender preference and perception of surgeons among Jordanian adults.",0
Implant Preference and Clinical Outcomes of Patients with Staged Bilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty: All-Polyethylene and Contralateral Metal-Backed Tibial Components.,"Numerous studies have compared metal-backed components (MBTs) and all-polyethylene tibial components (APTs), but none of them specifically analysed the clinical results and the overall patient preference in patients who had undergone a staged bilateral knee replacement. The purpose of this study is to compare clinical results, perceived range of motion, and overall implant preference among patients who had undergone staged bilateral knee replacement with an APT and contralateral knee replacement with MBTs. A dataset of 62 patients from a single centre who underwent staged bilateral TKA between 2009 and 2022 was selected and retrospectively analysed. Tibial component removal was performed in three knees overall, all of which had MBTs. The mean measured Knee Score (KS) of knees with APTs was 78.37 and that of contralateral knees with MBTs was 77.4. The mean measured Function (FS) of knees with APTs was 78.22, and that of contralateral knees with MBs was 76.29. The mean flexion angle of knees with APTs was 103.8 and that for knees with MBTs was 101.04 degrees. A total of 54.8% of the patients preferred the knee that received APTs over contralateral MBTs. In our cohort, TKA with an APT in one knee and an MBT in the contralateral knee recorded similar clinical results and perceived ranges of motion. Patients in general preferred the knee that received an APT over contralateral knee with an MBT.",0
Advance Care Planning in Serious Illness: A Narrative Review.,"CONTEXT: Advance care planning (ACP) intends to support person-centered medical decision-making by eliciting patient preferences. Research has not identified significant associations between ACP and goal-concordant end-of-life care, leading to justified scientific debate regarding ACP utility. OBJECTIVE: To delineate ACP's potential benefits and missed opportunities and identify an evidence-informed, clinically relevant path ahead for ACP in serious illness. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review merging the best available ACP empirical data, grey literature, and emergent scholarly discourse using a snowball search of PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar (2000-2022). Findings were informed by our team's interprofessional clinical and research expertise in serious illness care. RESULTS: Early ACP practices were largely tied to mandated document completion, potentially failing to capture the holistic preferences of patients and surrogates. ACP models focused on serious illness communication rather than documentation show promising patient and clinician results. Ideally, ACP would lead to goal-concordant care even amid the unpredictability of serious illness trajectories. But ACP might also provide a false sense of security that patients' wishes will be honored and revisited at end-of-life. An iterative, 'building block' framework to integrate ACP throughout serious illness is provided alongside clinical practice, research, and policy recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: We advocate a balanced approach to ACP, recognizing empirical deficits while acknowledging potential benefits and ethical imperatives (e.g., fostering clinician-patient trust and shared decision-making). We support prioritizing patient/surrogate-centered outcomes with more robust measures to account for interpersonal clinician-patient variables that likely inform ACP efficacy and may better evaluate information gleaned during serious illness encounters.",0
Developing hospital resilience domains in facing disruption era in Indonesia: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: The studies of hospital resilience have been of increasing importance during the last decade due to disasters and pandemics. However, studies in developing the domain and indicators of hospital resilience were limited mainly on disaster response. A few studies of hospital resilience focused on how to deal with disruptions such as environmental turbulence, rapid technological changes, and changes in patient preferences. This study aims to develop domains and indicators of hospital resilience in facing the disruption era. METHODS: This qualitative study focused on exploring the domains and indicators to face disruptions that have been identified in the first exploratory phase of the studies. Key informants included hospital experts from the government, medical practitioners, and academics. A total of 20 key informants were involved in semi-structured interviews which were conducted face-to-face, via telephone and Zoom. Data was analyzed using a grounded theory approach to discover domains for a resilient hospital. RESULTS: The study identified a number of domains that are fundamental for a hospital to become a resilient in the face of disruption. These include readiness to face digital transformation, effective leadership, and flexibility in managing resources among others. Situation awareness and resilience ethos, implementation of marketing management, networking, and disaster anticipation are found to be equally important. These domains focused on the hospital's ability to deal with specific shocks from different perspectives as the result of changes from disruptions which are inevitable within the organizational business environment. CONCLUSIONS: The domains identified in the study are able to respond to the limitations of the concept of hospital resilience, which is currently more focused on hospital disaster resilience. They can be used to measure hospital resilience in the context of the volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA), which are relevant to the context of the Indonesia hospital industry.",0
Nurses' perception of the hospitals' culture and readiness of evidence-based practise integration in the hospital's system in western Ethiopia.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based practise is a method by which healthcare professionals integrate the best available evidence, individual expertise and patient preferences to improve patient safety and utilise quality healthcare. No study was conducted in Ethiopia to assess the nurses' perception of the hospitals' culture and readiness for evidence-based practice integration into the hospital's system. Hence, this study aimed to assess the perception of nurses on the hospitals' culture and readiness of evidence-based practise integration in hospitals' systems in Western Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 412 nurses in six hospitals in western Ethiopia was conducted between December 2022 and February 2023. A 25-item Organisational Culture and Readiness of System-Wide Integration of EBP scale was used, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.94. While 25 is the minimum score, 125 is the maximum; higher scores indicate better hospital culture and readiness for system-wide integration of evidence-based practice. A self-administered data collection technique was used. Descriptive statistics were computed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 25 software. RESULTS: Four hundred and twelve nurses participated in the study. The majority (85.9%) were bachelor's degree holders and over a third (34.7%) worked in primary hospitals. Only a quarter (26.5%) had ever received mentorship from their leader on implementing evidence-based practice. The overall hospital culture and readiness score for system-wide integration of evidence-based practice among nurses in six hospitals was 70.3 ± 17.3. CONCLUSION: The nurses' perception of the hospitals' culture and readiness score for system-wide integration of evidence-based practice in six hospitals in Western Ethiopia was equivocal. There is a need to engage all resources and increase leadership commitment to make evidence-based practice a hospital culture. Further research is warranted to understand the national hospitals' status in establishing and sustaining evidence-based practise culture.",0
Women's preferences for less active ectopic pregnancy treatment: A discrete choice experiment.,"RESEARCH QUESTION: Shared decision-making has become a hallmark of quality care and is increasingly spotlighted in practice guidelines. Little is known about women's views for treatment of less active ectopic pregnancy. What are the preferences of women for less active ectopic pregnancy treatment-related attributes? DESIGN: A discrete choice model with 8 attributes depicting ectopic pregnancy treatment including varying levels of first-line treatment effectiveness, length of hospitalization, cost, length of sick leave, of convalescence, need for surgical management, for emergency care during convalescence and for tube removal was used. Childbearing aged women, i.e. those who might experience an ectopic pregnancy in the future, were recruited. They were asked to choose between hypothetical treatments in 18 choice tasks with different levels of all treatment attributes. A conditional logit McFadden's choice model was performed. The main outcome measure was preference weights for less active ectopic pregnancy treatment-related attributes. RESULTS: A total of 5770 observations from 178 women were analysed. The attributes displaying the highest marginal impacts on women's decisions included: higher rate of first-line treatment effectiveness, lower rate of tube removal, lower rate of surgical management, shorter length of hospitalization and, to a lesser extent, but still significant, shorter length of convalescence, absence of risk of emergency care during convalescence and lower cost. CONCLUSIONS: Trade-offs made by women between the attributes of less active ectopic pregnancy treatment suggest that no treatment option, either medical or surgical, is an obvious preferred option. These results encourage the promotion of shared decision-making.",1
Preferences of Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis for Intrathecal Drug Delivery: Choosing between an Implanted Drug-Delivery Device and Therapeutic Lumbar Puncture.,"BACKGROUND: Novel intrathecal treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may require delivery using lumbar puncture (LP). Implanted drug-delivery devices (IDDDs) could be an alternative but little is known about patients' preferences for intrathecal drug-delivery methods. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to elicit preferences of patients with ALS for routine LP and IDDD use. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) and a threshold technique (TT) exercise were conducted online among patients with ALS in the US and Europe. In the DCE, patients made trade-offs between administration attributes. Attributes were identified from qualitative interviews. The TT elicited maximum acceptable risks (MARs) of complications from device implantation surgery. DCE data were analyzed using mixed logit to quantify relative attribute importance (RAI) as the maximum contribution of each attribute to a preference, and to estimate MARs of device failure. TT data were analyzed using interval regression. Four scenarios of LP and IDDD were compared. RESULTS: Participants (N = 295) had a mean age of 57.7 years; most (74.2%) were diagnosed < 3 years ago. Preferences were affected by device failure risk (RAI 28.6%), administration frequency (26.4%), administration risk (19.7%), overall duration (17.8%), and appointment location (7.5%). Patients accepted a 5.6% device failure risk to reduce overall duration from 2 h to 30 min and a 3.6% risk for administration in a local clinic instead of a hospital. The average MAR of complications from implantation surgery was 29%. Patients preferred IDDD over LP in three of four scenarios. CONCLUSION: Patients considered an IDDD as a valuable alternative to LP in multiple clinical settings.",1
Interleukin-17A Inhibitors in Patients with Psoriasis and Tuberculosis Infection: A 2-Year Prospective Study on Safety Without Preventive Treatment.,"INTRODUCTION: The necessity for tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) and routine T-SPOT.TB monitoring in patients with psoriasis and tuberculosis infection (TBI) undergoing interleukin (IL)-17A inhibitor therapy remains uncertain. This study aims to evaluate the long-term safety of IL-17A inhibitors administered without TPT and analyze changes in T-SPOT.TB among these patients. It also identifies risk factors for TBI in patients with psoriasis. METHODS: This single-center prospective study enrolled adult patients with plaque psoriasis and TBI receiving IL-17A inhibitors. TBI was defined as positive T-SPOT.TB results (≥ 6 spots) without symptoms or evidence of active tuberculosis (ATB). TPT administration was based on contraindications, tuberculosis risk factors, and patient preferences. The primary endpoint was the incidence of ATB over 2 years. Secondary outcomes included T-SPOT.TB changes and TBI risk factors. RESULTS: Of the 129 patients with psoriasis and TBI enrolled in the study, 97 (75.2%) did not receive TPT, while 32 (24.8%) did. Among them, 109 patients (84.5%) completed the 2-year follow-up. During the 235 person-years of observation, no ATB cases were identified. Median T-SPOT.TB values showed no significant changes from baseline to year 2 in both the non-TPT (20 vs. 17 spots, p = 0.975) and TPT groups (55 vs. 58 spots, p = 0.830). T-SPOT.TB reversed in 14 patients (12.8%), mostly in the non-TPT group. Moreover, for TBI risk factor analysis, a cohort of 212 patients with psoriasis with negative baseline T-SPOT.TB was evaluated, revealing a TBI prevalence of 37.8%. Logistic regression analysis highlighted age ≥ 45 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.50-3.99, p < 0.001) and body mass index (BMI) < 24.0 kg/m(2) (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.27-3.54, p = 0.004) as independent risk factors for TBI. CONCLUSION: IL-17A inhibitors do not appear to reactivate tuberculosis in patients with psoriasis and TBI, potentially reducing the need for routine TBI screening and preventive treatment.

"An Online Decision Aid for Patients With Metastatic Melanoma—Results of the Randomized Controlled Trial ""PEF-Immun"".","BACKGROUND: Treatment decisions in metastatic melanoma (MM) depend on patient preferences and require the patients' involvement in the decision-making process. Patients often feel overwhelmed by the complexity of treatment options with their individual advantages and disadvantages. We developed an online patient decision aid (PtDA) to facilitate shared decision making (SDM). METHODS: We conducted a two-center, two-armed, prospective, open randomized controlled trial with MM patients who were facing a decision about first-line treatment. They were randomly allotted (1:1) to the use or non-use of the PtDA before discussing the choice of treatment with a physician (intervention group [IG] and control group [CG], respectively). The primary endpoint of the study was patient knowledge about first-line treatment options (multiple-choice test, 10 items, range 0-40 points). The secondary endpoints were the degree of SDM (ratings of audio recordings of the patient-physician discussions by third-party observers) and satisfaction with the decision that was taken on later follow-up. RESULTS: 120 of the 128 randomized patients completed the baseline questionnaire and were included in the analysis (59% male, median age 66 years). The primary endpoint, i.e., the mean difference in knowledge after discussion with a physician, was significantly higher in the intervention group (mean difference -3.22, 95% CI [-6.32;-0.12], p = 0.042). No difference was found in either of the secondary endpoints (SDM and satisfaction with the decision). The patients in the intervention group rated the PtDA as very useful. CONCLUSION: PtDA improved MM patients' knowledge about their options for treatment. Both patients who used it and patients who did not were highly satisfied with their treatment decisions. Additional physician training seems necessary to promote SDM.",0
Evaluation of post-operative surveillance strategies and surgeon perceptions and beliefs of surveillance for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in the UK.,"BACKGROUND: Despite high rates of recurrence after surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) there is lack of standardised surveillance practices. We aimed to identify UK surveillance practice and interrogate surgeon beliefs around surveillance. METHODS: A web-based survey was sent to all UK pancreatic units to assess surveillance practice for resected PDAC, factors influencing surveillance protocols, and perceptions and beliefs surrounding on current postoperative surveillance. RESULTS: There was wide variation in reported practice between 40 consultant surgeons from 28 pancreatic units (100% unit response rate). 26% had standardised surveillance compared to 18% with no standardised practice. 16% individualised surveillance to the patient, and 40% reported differing practices between surgeons within units despite local surveillance protocols. 66% felt surveillance should be tailored to patient factors, and 58% to patient preference. There was a broad belief regarding a lack of robust evidence supporting surveillance making a trial necessary. Thematic analysis identified surveillance barriers, considerations for trial design, necessity for patient engagement and potential benefits of surveillance. DISCUSSION: Wide variation in surveillance practice exists within and between units. A surveillance trial was deemed beneficial, however identified barriers potentially preclude a trial. Future work should assess acceptability for patients including impact on anxiety and quality-of-life.",0
Abdominal Hysterectomy.,"Abdominal hysterectomy was first performed in 1843. Prior attempts at removal of the uterus date back to ancient times, when vaginal hysterectomy was performed to treat uterine prolapse or inversion. Laparoscopic assistance was used to facilitate minimally invasive hysterectomy in 1989 and further advanced in 2005 with the approval of the robotic-assisted technique. Today, abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and a combination of vaginal and laparoscopic techniques are utilized for hysterectomy. The surgical approach to hysterectomy depends on the clinical indication, the technical experience of the surgeon, the resources available, the general health condition of the patient, and patient preference. An abdominal hysterectomy involves the removal of the uterus through an incision in the abdominal wall. As minimally invasive techniques have become more available, the rates of abdominal hysterectomy have declined since the less invasive approaches offer benefits such as less post-operative pain, expedited recovery times, and better short-term quality of life after surgery, as well as shorter hospitalization stays and reduced costs. Furthermore, the use of hysterectomy, in general, has decreased as alternatives to hysterectomy continue to gain favor, such as endometrial ablation for symptomatic uterine bleeding and uterine artery embolization for uterine leiomyomas. Still, hysterectomy remains the most appropriate management option for many patients. Large uterine size has been cited as a common reason for choosing the abdominal approach to hysterectomy, as it has been thought that an enlarged uterus may require better visualization and exposure due to higher risks of blood loss, injury to neighboring viscera, and prolonged operating times. However, there are no specific recommendations up to which uterine weight or size should qualify a patient for abdominal hysterectomy, and studies have shown that minimally invasive techniques, such as laparoscopy, can safely remove larger uteri. Despite these findings, abdominal hysterectomy remains a common route of surgery being most commonly indicated for uterine fibroids, followed by abnormal uterine bleeding, prolapse, and endometriosis.",0
Comparing Discrete Choice Experiment with Swing Weighting to Estimate Attribute Relative Importance: A Case Study in Lung Cancer Patient Preferences.,"INTRODUCTION: Discrete choice experiments (DCE) are commonly used to elicit patient preferences and to determine the relative importance of attributes but can be complex and costly to administer. Simpler methods that measure relative importance exist, such as swing weighting with direct rating (SW-DR), but there is little empirical evidence comparing the two. This study aimed to directly compare attribute relative importance rankings and weights elicited using a DCE and SW-DR. METHODS: A total of 307 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer in Italy and Belgium completed an online survey assessing preferences for cancer treatment using DCE and SW-DR. The relative importance of the attributes was determined using a random parameter logit model for the DCE and rank order centroid method (ROC) for SW-DR. Differences in relative importance ranking and weights between the methods were assessed using Cohen's weighted kappa and Dirichlet regression. Feedback on ease of understanding and answering the 2 tasks was also collected. RESULTS: Most respondents (>65%) found both tasks (very) easy to understand and answer. The same attribute, survival, was ranked most important irrespective of the methods applied. The overall ranking of the attributes on an aggregate level differed significantly between DCE and SW-ROC (P < 0.01). Greater differences in attribute weights between attributes were reported in DCE compared with SW-DR (P < 0.01). Agreement between the individual-level attribute ranking across methods was moderate (weighted Kappa 0.53-0.55). CONCLUSION: Significant differences in attribute importance between DCE and SW-DR were found. Respondents reported both methods being relatively easy to understand and answer. Further studies confirming these findings are warranted. Such studies will help to provide accurate guidance for methods selection when studying relative attribute importance across a wide array of preference-relevant decisions. HIGHLIGHTS: Both DCEs and SW tasks can be used to determine attribute relative importance rankings and weights; however, little evidence exists empirically comparing these methods in terms of outcomes or respondent usability.Most respondents found the DCE and SW tasks very easy or easy to understand and answer.A direct comparison of DCE and SW found significant differences in attribute importance rankings and weights as well as a greater spread in the DCE-derived attribute relative importance weights.",1
Delivering Prognostic News to Older People with Chronic Disease: What Format Preference and Level of Involvement in Decision Making? A Hospital Survey.,"Shared decision making near end of life is a balancing act of communicating prognosis to patients and their surrogates/families and engaging them in considering value-concordant management choices. This cross-sectional survey aimed to determine the format in which older patients with chronic illnesses would prefer to receive prognostic information on their treatment options and disease progression, and their desired level of engagement in decision making. With a 60% participation rate, 139 inpatients in two hospitals and five surrogates were presented with six hypothetical scenarios with a randomly assigned sequence: verbal and written summary, graph, table, photo, video, and pamphlet. The majority (76%) of respondents chose the traditional verbal communication of prognosis by their doctor with a written summary as a reference and to share with family; the second choice was a condition-specific pamphlet (63%). Many found the graph and photo to be distressing (36% and 42%, respectively). Most (71%) wanted to know everything about their condition trajectory, and 63% chose shared decision making rather than completely autonomous or full delegation to clinicians or family. There were no gender differentials between wanting to know it all, supporting shared decision making or the preferred format for breaking news (p > 0.05). Older hospitalized patients with chronic conditions are willing to discuss end-of-life issues, learn about their prognosis, and be involved in shared decision making. Innovative formats such as graphs, videos, or photos were not welcome as part of the prognostic discussion.",0
CAPER: patient preferences to inform nonsurgical treatment of chronic low back pain: a discrete-choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVE: We developed and used a discrete-choice measure to study patient preferences with regard to the risks and benefits of nonsurgical treatments when they are making treatment selections for chronic low back pain. METHODS: ""CAPER TREATMENT"" (Leslie Wilson) was developed with standard choice-based conjoint procedures (discrete-choice methodology that mimics an individual's decision-making process). After expert input and pilot testing, our final measure had 7 attributes (chance of pain relief, duration of relief, physical activity changes, treatment method, treatment type, treatment time burden, and risks of treatment) with 3-4 levels each. Using Sawtooth software (Sawtooth Software, Inc., Provo, UT, USA), we created a random, full-profile, balanced-overlap experimental design. Respondents (n = 211) were recruited via an emailed online link and completed 14 choice-based conjoint choice pairs; 2 fixed questions; and demographic, clinical, and quality-of-life questions. Analysis was performed with random-parameters multinomial logit with 1000 Halton draws. RESULTS: Patients cared most about the chance of pain relief, followed closely by improving physical activity, even more than duration of pain relief. There was comparatively less concern about time commitment and risks. Gender and socioeconomic status influenced preferences, especially with relation to strength of expectations for outcomes. Patients experiencing a low level of pain (Pain, Enjoyment, and General Activity Scale [PEG], question 1, numeric rating scale score<4) had a stronger desire for maximally improved physical activity, whereas those in a high level of pain (PEG, question 1, numeric rating scale score>6) preferred both maximum and more limited activity. Highly disabled patients (Oswestry Disability Index score>40) demonstrated distinctly different preferences, placing more weight on achieving pain control and less on improving physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with chronic low back pain were willing to trade risks and inconveniences for better pain control and physical activity. Additionally, different preference phenotypes exist, which suggests a need for clinicians to target treatments to particular patients.",1
How can we elicit health workers' preferences for measures to reduce informal payments? A mixed methods approach to developing a discrete choice experiment in Tanzania.,"OBJECTIVE: While discrete choice experiments (DCEs) have been used in other fields as a means of eliciting respondent preferences, these remain relatively new in studying corrupt practices in the health sector. This study documents and discusses the process of developing a DCE to inform policy measures aimed at addressing informal payments for healthcare in Tanzania. DESIGN: A mixed methods design was used to systematically develop attributes for the DCE. It involved five stages: a scoping literature review, qualitative interviews, a workshop with health providers and managers, expert review and a pilot study. SETTING: Dar es Salaam and Pwani regions in Tanzania. PARTICIPANTS: Health workers and health managers. RESULTS: A large number of factors were identified as driving informal payments in Tanzania and thus represent potential areas for policy intervention. Through iterative process involving different methods (qualitative and quantitative) and seeking consensus views by diverse actors, we derived six attributes for a DCE: mode of payment, supervision at the facility level, opportunity for private practice, awareness and monitoring, disciplinary measures against informal payments and incentive payment for staff if a facility has less informal payments. 12 choice sets were generated and piloted with 15 health workers from 9 health facilities. The pilot study revealed that respondents could easily understand the attributes and levels, answered all the choice sets and appeared to be trading between the attributes. The results from the pilot study had expected signs for all attributes. CONCLUSIONS: We elicited attributes and levels for a DCE to identify the acceptability and preferences of potential policy interventions to address informal payments in Tanzania through a mixed-methods approach. We argue that more attention is needed to the process of defining attributes for the DCE, which needs to be rigorous and transparent in order to derive reliable and policy-relevant findings.",1
Eliciting preferences of persons with dementia and informal caregivers to support ageing in place in the Netherlands: a protocol for a discrete choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Ageing in place (AIP) for persons with dementia is encouraged by European governments and societies. Healthcare packages may need reassessment to account for the preferences of care funders, patients and informal caregivers. By providing insight into people's preferences, discrete choice experiments (DCEs) can help develop consensus between stakeholders. This protocol paper outlines the development of a Dutch national study to cocreate a healthcare package design methodology built on DCEs that is person-centred and helps support informal caregivers and persons with dementia to AIP. A subpopulation analysis of persons with dementia with a migration background is planned due to their high risk for dementia and under-representation in research and care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The DCE is designed to understand how persons with dementia and informal caregivers choose between different healthcare packages. Qualitative methods are used to identify and prioritise important care components for persons with dementia to AIP. This will provide a list of care components that will be included in the DCE, to quantify the care needs and preferences of persons with dementia and informal caregivers. The DCE will identify individual and joint preferences to AIP. The relative importance of each attribute will be calculated. The DCE data will be analysed with the use of a random parameters logit model. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was waived by the Amsterdam University Medical Center (W23_112 #23.137). A study summary will be available on the websites of Alzheimer Nederland, Pharos and Amsterdam Public Health institute. Results are expected to be presented at (inter)national conferences, peer-reviewed papers will be submitted, and a dissemination meeting will be held to bring stakeholders together. The study results will help improve healthcare package design for all stakeholders.",1
Preferences for first-line treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma among US practicing oncologists and patients.,"Aim: Investigate oncologist and patient preferences for the first-line treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma. Materials & methods: A discrete-choice experiment was used to elicit treatment attribute preferences, including patient treatment experience (number and duration of treatments and grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events), overall survival and treatment administration frequency. Results: The study included 151 eligible medical oncologists and 150 patients with urothelial carcinoma. Both physicians and patients appeared to prefer treatment attributes related to overall survival, treatment-related adverse events and the number and duration of the medications in a regimen over frequency of administration. Overall survival had the most influence in driving oncologists' treatment preferences, followed by the patient's treatment experience. Patients found the treatment experience the most important attribute when considering options, followed by overall survival. Conclusion: Patient preferences were based on treatment experience, while oncologists preferred treatments that prolong overall survival. These results help to direct clinical conversations, treatment recommendations and clinical guideline development.",1
Face-down positioning or posturing after pars plana vitrectomy for macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachments.,"BACKGROUND: A macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is one of the most common ophthalmic surgical emergencies and causes significant visual morbidity. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with gas tamponade is often performed to repair primary macula-involving RRDs with a high rate of anatomical retinal reattachment. It has been advocated by some ophthalmologists that face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade helps reduce postoperative retinal displacement. Retinal displacement can cause metamorphopsia and binocular diplopia. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review is to determine whether face-down positioning reduces the risk of retinal displacement following PPV and gas tamponade for primary macula-involving RRDs. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2022, Issue 11), MEDLINE (January 1946 to 28 November 2022), Embase.com (January 1947 to 28 November 2022), PubMed (1948 to 28 November 2022), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database (1982 to 28 November 2022), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search. We last searched the electronic databases on 28 November 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which face-down positioning was compared with no positioning or another form of positioning following PPV and gas tamponade for primary macula-involving RRDs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodology and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for the prespecified outcomes using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three RCTs (369 eyes of 368 participants) that met the eligibility criteria. Two RCTs provided data on postoperative retinal displacement, one reported on postoperative distortion and quality of life outcomes, two on postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in logMAR, and two on postoperative ocular adverse events such as outer retinal folds. Study characteristics and risk of bias All the trials involved predominantly male participants (range: 68% to 72%). Only one trial provided race and ethnicity information, was registered on a trial registry, and reported funding sources. Using the RoB 2 tool, we assessed the risk of bias for proportion of eyes with retinal displacement, mean change in visual acuity, objective distortion scores, quality of life assessments, and ocular adverse events, with most domains judged to be at low risk of bias. Findings Immediate face-down positioning may result in a lower proportion of participants with postoperative retinal displacement compared with support-the-break positioning at six months (risk ratio [RR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54 to 0.99; 1 RCT; 239 eyes of 239 participants; very low certainty evidence). One study found no evidence of a difference in BCVA at three months when comparing postoperative face-up with face-down positioning with or without perfluorocarbon liquid (mean difference [MD] -0.03, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.02; I(2) = 0; 56 eyes of 56 participants; very low certainty evidence). Immediate face-down positioning appears to have little to no effect on postoperative distortion scores at week 26 (MD 1.80, 95% CI -1.92 to 5.52; 1 RCT; 219 eyes of 219 participants; very low certainty evidence) and postoperative quality of life assessment scores at week 26 (MD -1.80, 95% CI -5.52 to 1.92; 1 RCT; 217 eyes of 217 participants; very low certainty evidence). Adverse events One study that enrolled 262 participants with macula-involving RRDs suggested that immediate face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade may reduce the ocular adverse event of postoperative outer retinal folds at six months (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.90; 1 RCT; 262 eyes of 262 participants; very low certainty evidence) and binocular diplopia (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.90; 1 RCT; 262 eyes of 262 participants; very low certainty evidence) compared with support-the-break positioning. Immediate face-down positioning may increase the ocular adverse event of elevated intraocular pressure compared with support-the-break positioning (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.73; 1 RCT; 262 eyes of 262 participants; very low certainty evidence). Another study found no evidence of a difference in postoperative outer retinal folds when comparing face-down versus face-up positioning at one and three months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.02; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.28 to 3.61; 1 RCT; 56 eyes of 56 participants; very low certainty evidence). No studies reported non-ocular adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Very low certainty evidence suggests that immediate face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade may result in a reduction in postoperative retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia, but may increase the chance of postoperative raised intraocular pressure compared with support-the-break positioning at six months. We identified two ongoing trials that compare face-down positioning with face-up positioning following PPV and gas tamponade in participants with primary macula-involving RRDs, whose results may provide relevant evidence for our stated objectives. Future trials should be rigorously designed, and investigators should analyze outcome data appropriately and report adequate information to provide evidence of high certainty. Quality of life and patient preferences should be examined in addition to clinical and adverse event outcomes.",0
Preferences for Anaemia Treatment Attributes among Patients with Non-Dialysis-Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Information about patient preferences for the treatment of anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is scarce. Hence, our aim was to examine how patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD valued attributes of alternative hypothetical anaemia treatments. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in adult patients who reported a clinical diagnosis of CKD-related anaemia. Treatment attributes included mode and frequency of administration, need for iron supplementation, risk of gastrointestinal side effects, risk of major cardiovascular events and impact on energy levels (as defined by the vitality section of the SF-6D health index). Logit models were used to analyse patients' preferences. RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 200 patients in four countries. Patients preferred an oral mode of administration. Patients were willing to tolerate a 5.1% (95% CI 2.0-8.3%) increase in the risk of a major cardiovascular event and an 11.7% (95% CI 5.0-18.5%) increase in the risk of gastrointestinal side effects to switch from an at-home subcutaneous injection administered once every 2 weeks to an at-home oral pill administered three times a week. Patients were willing to tolerate a 20.3% (95% CI 15.0-25.6%) increase in the risk of gastrointestinal side effects and an 8.9% (95% CI 6.1-11.7%) increase in the risk of a major cardiovascular event to transition from 'Sometimes having a lot of energy' to 'Always having a lot of energy'. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD-related anaemia demonstrated clear treatment preferences and were willing to accept increased gastrointestinal or cardiovascular risks in exchange for more energy or an oral treatment.",1
Diabetes patient preferences for glucose-monitoring technologies: results from a discrete choice experiment in Poland and the Netherlands.,"INTRODUCTION: New glucose-monitoring technologies have different cost-benefit profiles compared with traditional finger-prick tests, resulting in a preference-sensitive situation for patients. This study aimed to assess the relative value adults with diabetes assign to device attributes in two countries. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults with type 1 or 2 diabetes from the Netherlands (n=226) and Poland (n=261) completed an online discrete choice experiment. Respondents choose between hypothetical glucose monitors described using seven attributes: precision, effort to check, number of finger pricks required, risk of skin irritation, information provided, alarm function and out-of-pocket costs. Panel mixed logit models were used to determine attribute relative importance and to calculate expected uptake rates and willingness to pay (WTP). RESULTS: The most important attribute for both countries was monthly out-of-pocket costs. Polish respondents were more likely than Dutch respondents to choose a glucose-monitoring device over a standard finger prick and had higher WTP for a device. Dutch respondents had higher WTP for device improvements in an effort to check and reduce the number of finger pricks a device requires. CONCLUSION: Costs are the primary concern of patients in both countries when choosing a glucose monitor and would likely hamper real-world uptake. The costs-benefit profiles of such devices should be critically reviewed.",1
"Preferences for innovations in healthcare delivery models in the Swiss elderly population: a latent class, choice modelling study.","BACKGROUND: With the increasing number of people affected by multiple chronic conditions, it is essential for public-health professionals to promote strategies addressing patient needs for coordinated care. We aim to explore preference heterogeneity for better-coordinated care delivery models in Swiss older adults, and identify profiles of individuals more open to healthcare reforms. METHODS: A DCE (discrete choice experiment) survey was developed online and on paper for the Swiss adults aged 50+, following best practice. To elicit preferences, we estimated a latent class model allowing grouping individuals with similar preferences into distinct classes, and examined what background characteristics contributed to specific class membership. RESULTS: The optimal model identified three classes with different openness to reforms. Class 1 (49%) members were concerned with premium increases and were in favour of integrated care structures with care managed by interprofessional teams. Individuals in class 2 (19%) were younger, open to reforms, and expressed the needs for radical changes within the Swiss healthcare system. Class 3 respondents (32%) were strongly reluctant to changes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study goes beyond average preferences and identifies three distinct population profiles, a majority open to reforms on specific aspects of care delivery, a smallest group in favour radical changes, and a third strongly against changes. Therefore, tailored approaches around healthcare reforms are needed, e.g. explaining the role of interprofessional teams in coordinating care, electronic health records and insurance premium variation.",1
Six month incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events among adults with HIV in northern Tanzania: a prospective observational study.,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to prospectively describe incident cardiovascular events among people living with HIV (PLWH) in northern Tanzania. Secondary aims of this study were to understand non-communicable disease care-seeking behaviour and patient preferences for cardiovascular care and education. DESIGN: A prospective observational study. SETTING: This study was conducted at the Majengo HIV Care and Treatment Clinic, an outpatient government-funded clinic in Moshi, Tanzania PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients presenting to an HIV clinic for routine care in northern Tanzania were enrolled from 1 September 2020 to 1 March 2021. INTERVENTIONS: At enrolment, participants completed a survey and a resting 12-lead ECG was obtained. At 6 month follow-up, a repeat survey regarding interim health events and repeat ECG was obtained. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Interim major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were defined by: self-reported interim stroke, self-reported hospitalisation for heart failure, self-reported interim myocardial infarction, interim myocardial infarction by ECG criteria (new pathologic Q waves in two contiguous leads) or death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). RESULTS: Of 500 enrolled participants, 477 (95.4%) completed 6 month follow-up and 3 (0.6%) died. Over the 6 month follow-up period, 11 MACE occurred (3 strokes, 6 myocardial infarctions, 1 heart failure hospitalisation and 1 cardiovascular death), resulting in an incidence rate of 4.58 MACE per 100 person-years. Of participants completing 6 month follow-up, 31 (6.5%) reported a new non-communicable disease diagnosis, including 23 (4.8%) with a new hypertension diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of MACE among PLWH in Tanzania is high. These findings are an important preliminary step in understanding the landscape of CVD among PLWH in Tanzania and highlight the need for interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk in this population.",0
Seborrheic keratosis.,"Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is the most common benign epidermal tumor in clinical dermatological practice. This review summarizes current knowledge about the clinical and histological appearance, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of SK. There are different subtypes of SK based on clinical presentation and histologic findings. Several factors, including age, genetic predisposition, and possibly also exposure to ultraviolet radiation, are thought to contribute to the development of SK. The lesions can occur on all areas of the body except for the palms and soles, but the most common sites are the face and upper trunk. The diagnosis is usually made clinically, and in some cases by dermatoscopy or histology. Many patients prefer to have the lesions removed for cosmetic reasons although there is no medical indication. Treatment options include surgical therapy, laser therapy, electrocautery, cryotherapy, and topical drug therapy, which is currently in development. Treatment should be individualized depending on the clinical picture and patient preference.",0
Humanistic and Economic Burden of IgA Nephropathy: Systematic Literature Reviews and Narrative Synthesis.,"BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is a progressive inflammatory kidney disease requiring long-term treatment to reduce the risk of progression to kidney failure. Here, we present two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) to identify and summarize literature reporting the humanistic and economic burden of IgAN. METHODS: Electronic literature databases (Ovid Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane) were searched for relevant literature on 29 November 2021, supplemented with gray literature searches. Studies reporting any health-related quality of life (HRQoL) or health state utility outcomes in IgAN patients were included in the humanistic impact SLR, and studies reporting the costs and healthcare resource utilization associated with or economic models of IgAN disease management were included in the economic burden SLR. Narrative synthesis was used to discuss the heterogeneous studies included in the SLRs. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines were followed, and all included studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Center for Evidence-Based Management tool for Critical Appraisal of a Survey or the Drummond Checklist. RESULTS: A total of 876 and 1122 references were identified from electronic and gray literature searches for humanistic and economic burden, respectively. Three studies reporting humanistic impact and five studies reporting economic burden met criteria for inclusion in these SLRs. The included humanistic studies reported patient preferences in the USA and China, HRQoL for patients with IgAN in Poland, and impact of exercise on HRQoL for patients with IgAN in China. The five economic studies reported costs of IgAN treatment in Canada, Italy, and China, along with two economic models from Japan. DISCUSSION: Current literature suggests IgAN is associated with substantial humanistic and economic burdens. However, these SLRs demonstrate the paucity of research conducted to specifically describe the humanistic or economic burden of IgAN and highlight the need for further research.",0
Practices and Views of US Oncologists and Genetic Counselors Regarding Patient Recontact After Variant Reclassification: Results of a Nationwide Survey.,"PURPOSE: Over a 5-year or 10-year period, between 6% and 15% of germline cancer genetic variants undergo reclassification. Up-to-date interpretation can clarify a variant's clinical significance and guide patient management. As the frequency of reclassifications increase, the issue of whether, how, when, and which providers should recontact patients with information about reclassification becomes important. However, the field lacks research evidence and definitive guidance from professional organizations about how providers should recontact patients. We compared the perspectives of US oncologists and cancer genetic counselors (GCs) to describe their practices and views regarding recontact. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a survey using themes identified from semistructured interviews with oncologists and GCs and administered it in a national sample of oncologists and GCs between July and September 2022. RESULTS: In total, 634 respondents completed the survey including 349 oncologists and 285 GCs. On frequency of recontacting patients with reclassified results, 40% of GCs reported recontacting often compared with 12.5% of oncologists. Neither group reported recording patient preference for recontact on electronic medical record (EMR). Both groups agreed that all reclassified variants, even those that do not affect clinical management, should be returned to patients. They also reported that recontact via EMR messages, mailed letters, and phone calls from GC assistants were more suitable for downgrades. By contrast, face-to-face meetings and phone calls were preferred for upgrades. Remarkably, oncologists were more likely to endorse face-to-face return of results and were more likely to endorse return through a nongenetics provider compared to GCs. CONCLUSION: These data on current recontact practices and opinions provide a foundation for developing guidelines with explicit recommendations on patient recontact that can help maximize clinical effect while considering provider preferences for recontact within resource-constrained genomic practice settings.",0
International Delphi Study on Wound Closure and Incision Management in Joint Arthroplasty Part 2: Total Hip Arthroplasty.,"BACKGROUND: This modified Delphi study aimed to develop a consensus on optimal wound closure and incision management strategies for total hip arthroplasty (THA). Given the critical nature of wound care and incision management in influencing patient outcomes, this study sought to synthesize evidence-based best practices for wound care in THA procedures. METHODS: An international panel of 20 orthopedic surgeons from Europe, Canada, and the United States evaluated a targeted literature review of 18 statements (14 specific to THA and 4 related to both THA and total knee arthroplasty). There were 3 rounds of anonymous voting per topic using a modified 5-point Likert scale with a predetermined consensus threshold of ≥ 75% agreement necessary for a statement to be accepted. RESULTS: After 3 rounds of voting, consensus was achieved for all 18 statements. Notable recommendations for THA wound management included (1) the use of barbed sutures over non-barbed sutures (shorter closing times and overall cost savings); (2) the use of subcuticular sutures over skin staples (lower risk of superficial infections and higher patient preferences, but longer closing times); (3) the use of mesh-adhesives over silver-impregnated dressings (lower rate of wound complications); (4) for at-risk patients, the use of negative pressure wound therapy over other dressings (lower wound complications and reoperations, as well as fewer dressing changes); and (5) the use of triclosan-coated sutures (lower risk of surgical site infection) over standard sutures. CONCLUSIONS: Through a structured modified Delphi approach, a panel of 20 orthopedic surgeons reached consensus on all 18 statements pertaining to wound closure and incision management in THA. This study provides a foundational framework for establishing evidence-based best practices, aiming to reduce variability in patient outcomes and to enhance the overall quality of care in THA procedures.",0
Contemporary outcomes for arterial reconstruction with non-saphenous vein cryo-preserved conduits.,"OBJECTIVE: Cryopreserved (CP) products are utilized during challenging cases when autogenous or prosthetic conduit use is not feasible. Despite decades of experience with cadaveric greater saphenous vein (GSV), there is limited available data regarding the outcomes and patency of other CP products, specifically arterial and deep venous grafts. This study was designed to evaluate outcomes of non-GSV CP conduits in patients undergoing urgent, emergent, and elective arterial reconstruction at our institution. We hypothesized that non-GSV CP allografts have adequate patency and outcomes and are therefore a feasible alternative to GSV in settings where autologous graft is unavailable or prosthetic grafts are contraindicated. METHODS: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at our institution. We retrospectively reviewed charts of patients undergoing arterial reconstructions using CP conduits from 2010 to 2022. Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, smoking status, indications for surgery, indication for CP conduit use, anatomic reconstruction, urgency of procedure, and blood loss. Time-to-event outcomes included primary and secondary graft patency rates, follow-up amputations, and mortality; other complications included follow-up infection/reinfection and 30-day complications, including return to the operating room and perioperative mortality. Time-to-event analyses were evaluated using product-limit survival estimates. RESULTS: Of 96 identified patients receiving CP conduits, 56 patients received non-GSV conduits for 66 arterial reconstructions. The most common type of non-GSV CP product used was femoral artery (31 patients), followed by aorto-iliac artery (22 patients), and femoral vein (19 patients), with some patients receiving more than one reconstruction or CP product. Patients were mostly male (75%), with a mean age of 63.1 years and a mean body mass index of 26.7 kg/m(2). Indications for CP conduit use included infection in 53 patients, hostile environment in 36 patients, contaminated field in 30 patients, tissue coverage concerns in 30 patients, inadequate conduit in nine patients, and patient preference in one patient. Notably, multiple patients had more than one indication. Most surgeries (95%) were performed in urgent or emergent settings. Supra-inguinal reconstructions were most common (53%), followed by extra-anatomic bypasses (47%). Thirty-day mortality occurred in 10 patients (19%). Fifteen patients (27%) required return to the operating room for indications related to the vascular reconstructions, with 10 (18%) cases being unplanned and five (9%) cases planned/staged. Overall survival at 6, 12, and 24 months was 80%, 68%, and 59%, respectively. Primary patency at 6, 12, and 24 months was 86%, 70%, and 62%, respectively. Amputation freedom at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months was 98%, 95%, and 86%, respectively for non-traumatic indications. CONCLUSIONS: Non-GSV CP products may be used in complex arterial reconstructions when autogenous or prosthetic options are not feasible or available.",0
Determining Goal Concordant Care in the Intensive Care Unit Using Electronic Health Records.,"BACKGROUND: Goal concordant care (GCC) is the alignment of care to patient values and preferences. GCC is a major outcome of communication with patients and families in serious/critical illness. Using the electronic health record (EHR) to study the provision of GCC would be pragmatic and cost-effective for research and quality improvement efforts. RESEARCH QUESTION: Do EHRs contain information to identify GCC? METHODS: This is a feasibility retrospective chart review performed by two independent reviewers. An existing framework containing four questions for identifying GCC was adopted. Two clinicians reviewed multi-disciplinary notes and extracted pertinent information. The primary outcomes were whether the four key questions for determining goal concordance could be answered using information in the EHR. The secondary outcome was the type of goals identified. Cohen's kappa was used to measure agreement between two reviewers. RESULTS: Patient care was considered goal concordant in 35 (85%) of 41 patients in a random sample comprising of 36 survivors and five who died in hospital. Inter-rater agreement on identifying data to determine GCC was excellent (Kappa 0.70). Patient goals were identified in 80% of charts reviewed. Note sources informative of patient preferences, included social work (39%), hospital progress notes (29%), palliative care (20%), and physical/occupational therapy (15%). ""Returning home"" and ""getting better/ stronger"" were among the most common patient goals captured in EHR. CONCLUSION: The EHR can be used to understand patient goals, but the information is scattered across the multi-disciplinary notes. Improving EHR and external validation will facilitate ascertainment of goal concordance as an important outcome measure.",0
Beyond 10-year lead-times in EQ-5D-5L: leveraging alternative lead-times in willingness-to-accept questions to capture preferences for worse-than-dead states and their implication.,"BACKGROUND: A fixed 10-year lead-time in composite time-trade-off (C-TTO) tasks might compromise the precision of utility values below - 1. This study explored how alternative lead-times (ALTs) influence EQ-5D-5L value sets and their implications in economic evaluations. METHODS: Leveraging data from Taiwan's EQ-5D-5L valuation and capitalizing on its exploratory willingness-to-accept question, we explored participants' quantification of ""worse-than-dead (WTD)"" health states with ALTs up to 50 years. We then derived alternative value sets incorporating these ALTs through interval regression and compared them against those from conventional models. To evaluate their impact on health change valuation, we simulated utility differences for all possible EQ-5D-5L health-state-pairs using each value set. RESULTS: With a salient floor effect observed in the C-TTO values, the model with ALT led to a wider range of predicted utilities ( - 2.3897 ~ 1), compared with those of conventional models (generalized least squares (GLS):  - 0.7773 ~ 1; Tobit-GLS:  - 0.9583 ~ 1). Compared to the Tobit-GLS model, the model with ALT increased the numerical distance in 80% of health-state-pairs, with 11% decreasing and 9% altering direction (e.g., positive to negative) in utility differences. CONCLUSIONS: While ALTs offer insights into patient preferences, their integration into economic evaluations might require rescaling. Future research should prioritize advanced rescaling methods or enhanced elicitation strategies for populations with substantial censoring. This is pivotal for improving the elicitation of extreme WTD states and accurately discerning the relative distances between health states. Countries developing EQ-5D-5L value sets should consider pilot studies and incorporating region-specific questions on social determinants, especially where pronounced floor effects are suspected.",0
[Cosmetic outcome of nasal tip reconstruction with the frontonasal flap and other locoregional flaps - Cosmetic Outcome of Nasal Tip Reconstruction].,"BACKGROUND: This study investigates the results of nasal tip reconstruction with the frontonasal flap compared with other locoregional flaps. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All nasal tip reconstructions with locoregional flaps performed during a 10-year period were included. Defect size, flap type, risk factors, comorbidities, complications, revisions, and secondary operations were retrospectively assessed. Clinical follow-up examinations were performed after 12 months. Digital photographs were taken in standard projections preoperatively and at the time of the last follow-up examination, and the aesthetic results were assessed by three independent examiners, with nasal contour, symmetry, scarring, and match of skin colour between flap and nasal skin rated on a 4-point scale. Finally, patient satisfaction was obtained. RESULTS: A total of 112 nasal tip reconstructions were performed in 68 women and 44 men with a mean age of 71,4±10,2 years. Taking into account defect size, individual factors and patient preference, reconstruction was performed with 58 frontonasal flaps, 23 Rintala flaps, 20 paramedian forehead flaps and 11 bilobed flaps. Mean age and comorbidities of patients were comparable between flap types, except for a higher incidence of arterial hypertension and a lower incidence of diabetes mellitus in patients treated with frontonasal flaps. Defect size was the same in reconstructions with frontonasal flaps and Rintala flaps, smaller in bilobed flaps, and more extensive in paramedian forehead flaps. There were no differences in complication rates between the different flap techniques. Taking into account the planned second interventions (flap pedicle separations) in the paramedian forehead flaps, the frequency of unplanned corrections was comparable for all flap techniques. Aesthetic results and patient satisfaction were rated as very good or good in more than 90% with all techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the paramedian forehead flap, the frontonasal flap avoids a planned secondary procedure and an extensive donor defect. It allows for the coverage of defects at least the size of the Rintala flap and larger defects than the bilobed flap.",0
Patient-Preference Diagnostics: Adapting Stated-Preference Methods to Inform Effective Shared Decision Making.,"BACKGROUND: While clinical practice guidelines underscore the need to incorporate patient preferences in clinical decision making, incorporating meaningful assessment of patient preferences in clinical encounters is challenging. Structured approaches that combine quantitative patient preferences and clinical evidence could facilitate effective patient-provider communication and more patient-centric health care decisions. Adaptive conjoint or stated-preference approaches can identify individual preference parameters, but they can require a relatively large number of choice questions or simplifying assumptions about the error with which preferences are elicited. METHOD: We propose an approach to efficiently diagnose preferences of patients for outcomes of treatment alternatives by leveraging prior information on patient preferences to generate adaptive choice questions to identify a patient's proximity to known preference phenotypes. This information can be used for measuring sensitivity and specificity, much like any other diagnostic procedure. We simulated responses with varying levels of choice errors for hypothetical patients with specific preference profiles to measure sensitivity and specificity of a 2-question preference diagnostic. RESULTS: We identified 4 classes representing distinct preference profiles for patients who participated in a previous first-time anterior shoulder dislocation (FTASD) survey. Posterior probabilities of class membership at the end of a 2-question sequence ranged from 87% to 89%. We found that specificity and sensitivity of the 2-question sequences were robust to respondent errors. The questions appeared to have better specificity than sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that this approach could help diagnose patient preferences for treatments for a condition such as FTASD with acceptable precision using as few as 2 choice questions. Such preference-diagnostic tools could be used to improve and document alignment of treatment choices and patient preferences. HIGHLIGHTS: Approaches that combine patient preferences and clinical evidence can facilitate effective patient-provider communication and more patient-centric healthcare decisions. However, diagnosing individual-level preferences is challenging, and no formal diagnostic tools exist.We propose a structured approach to efficiently diagnose patient preferences based on prior information on the distribution of patient preferences in a population.We generated a 2-question test of preferences for the outcomes associated with the treatment of first-time anterior shoulder dislocation.The diagnosis of preferences can help physicians discuss relevant aspects of the treatment options and proactively address patient concerns during the clinical encounter.",1
Physician factors affecting patient preferences in selecting a primary care provider: A qualitative research study in Singapore.,"BACKGROUND: Care continuity by a dedicated, well-trained primary care physician (PCP) has shown to improve health outcomes of patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs). In Singapore's fee-for-service primary care system, patients can choose to consult any PCP in either a public (polyclinic), private (General Practitioners/ GP), or both types of clinics, resulting in potential fragmented care. Decision-making by patients in selecting their preferred PCP remains unclear. This study aims to explore the personal factors influencing the choice of PCP among patients with NCDs in primary care. METHODS: This qualitative research study was conducted in a typical polyclinic. In-depth interviews were conducted on patients with NCDs. Purposive sampling was implemented to enrol patients who had previously consulted PCPs in polyclinics and GP clinics, garnering their perspectives and experiences of care received from both providers. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and audited. Data was coded and analysed using thematic content analysis to identify emerging themes. The physician-specific factors which influence patients' decision-making of PCP selection are presented here. RESULTS: Twenty-one Asian patients aged 38 to 82 years were interviewed. They preferred PCPs with an approachable and genuine demeanour, exhibiting empathy and compassion. They valued the PCPs' verbal, non-verbal and listening skills. Regarding professional qualities, patients wanted PCPs to demonstrate competency and a patient-centred care approach. Some selected their PCP based on compatible age and gender that they felt comfortable with. Establishing good rapport with their PCP and maintaining continuity of care were deemed as major factors in patients' PCP selection. CONCLUSION: Patients tended to select PCPs based on their personal characteristics, interpersonal skills, professional attributes, demographics, and the physician-patient relationship. PCPs should be aware of these attributes and demonstrate them during their patient interaction. Leveraging on this enables PCPs to build rapport with their patients and maintain care continuity to optimize their health outcomes.",0
Racial and ethnic inequities in the quality of paediatric care in the USA: a review of quantitative evidence.,"Racial and ethnic inequities in paediatric care have received increased research attention over the past two decades, particularly in the past 5 years, alongside an increased societal focus on racism. In this Series paper, the first in a two-part Series focused on racism and child health in the USA, we summarise evidence on racial and ethnic inequities in the quality of paediatric care. We review studies published between Jan 1, 2017 and July 31, 2022, that are adjusted for or stratified by insurance status to account for group differences in access, and we exclude studies in which differences in access are probably driven by patient preferences or the appropriateness of intervention. Overall, the literature reveals widespread patterns of inequitable treatment across paediatric specialties, including neonatology, primary care, emergency medicine, inpatient and critical care, surgery, developmental disabilities, mental health care, endocrinology, and palliative care. The identified studies indicate that children from minoritised racial and ethnic groups received poorer health-care services relative to non-Hispanic White children, with most studies drawing on data from multiple sites, and accounting for indicators of family socioeconomic position and clinical characteristics (eg, comorbidities or condition severity). The studies discussed a range of potential causes for the observed disparities, including implicit biases and differences in site of care or clinician characteristics. We outline priorities for future research to better understand and address paediatric treatment inequities and implications for practice and policy. Policy changes within and beyond the health-care system, discussed further in the second paper of this Series, are essential to address the root causes of treatment inequities and to promote equitable and excellent health for all children.",0
Comparison of patient preferences and responsiveness among common patient-reported outcome measures for hand/wrist injuries or disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were developed to examine patients' perceptions of functional health. Most studies compare the responsiveness of each type of questionnaire. However, reports of patient preferences among PROMs commonly used with patients with hand/wrist injuries or disorders are limited. This study aimed to compare patient preferences, factors associated with those preferences and responsiveness among the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ), Patient-Rated Wrist/Hand Evaluation (PRWHE) and EQ-5D in patients with hand/wrist injuries or disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study collected data on 183 patients with hand/wrist injuries or diseases who had visited a hand/wrist outpatient clinic or were hospitalized for surgery between 2017 and 2020. Patients had to be at least 18 years old and able to complete the four questionnaires included in the study. The four PROMs (DASH, MHQ, PRWHE and EQ-5D) were administered to the patients prior to treatment. After completing the questionnaires, patients were asked to answer two open-ended questions regarding their preferences. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify factors related to patient preferences. Results are presented as the relative risk ratio (RRR). The standardized response mean (SRM) was used to evaluate questionnaire responsiveness. RESULTS: Of the 183 patients, most preferred the PRWHE questionnaire (n = 74, 41%), with the main reasons cited being ""specific to injuries/diseases and reflects hand/wrist function (n = 23, 31%)"" and ""easy to complete (n = 22, 30%)."" Sex was found to be associated with patient preference after adjusting for demographic data and reasons for choosing a PROM as confounders (RRR = 0.46, P value = 0.049). The PRWHE had the highest SRM, followed by DASH (0.92 and 0.88, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The PRWHE is the most preferred by patients and is the most responsive questionnaire. It is recommended for use in clinical practice in situations where a clinician would like to use only one PROM for evaluating patients with various types of hand/wrist problems. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic III.",0
Patients' Preferences for Connected Insulin Pens: A Discrete Choice Experiment Among Patients with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.,"BACKGROUND: This study quantified how people with diabetes value the unique features of connected insulin pens and related mobile apps, and the underlying reasons for preferring connected versus non-connected insulin pens. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in the USA and UK to elicit preferences of adults (≥ 18 years) with type 1 or 2 diabetes for attributes of insulin pens. Attributes included device type, dosing support, glucose monitoring, additional app features, and data sharing. Relative attribute importance (RAI) scores were calculated to capture the relative importance of an attribute. Predicted choice probabilities were obtained to compare different profiles for connected and non-connected insulin pens. RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 540 participants (58.9% male; 90.7% Caucasian; mean age, 58.3 years; 69.4% type 2 diabetes). Participants most valued the possibility of using a connected insulin pen with dosing support and automated dose logging (RAI = 39.9%), followed by automatic transfer of glucose levels (RAI = 29.0%), additional features of tracking diet and physical activity (RAI = 14.6%), data sharing (RAI = 13.6%), and device type (RAI = 2.9%). All profiles of connected insulin pens were preferred over a non-connected pen (p < 0.001), and pen profiles with advanced features were preferred over those without (p < 0.001). Preferences differed by age but not diabetes type, country of residence, or insulin regimen. CONCLUSION: People with diabetes in the USA and UK prefer connected over non-connected insulin pens due largely to the availability of automated logging of dose and glucose levels.",1
How Schroth Therapists Vary the Implementation of Schroth Worldwide for Adolescents with Idiopathic Scoliosis: A Mixed Methods Study.,"(1) Background: Schroth is a type of physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercise (PSSE) prescribed to adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Studies have investigated the effectiveness of Schroth but are yet to elucidate how Schroth is applied clinically and the factors that influence their prescription. (2) Methods: A mixed methods design was used comprising an anonymous survey and semi-structured interviews of Schroth therapists who treated AIS and who were publicly listed on the Barcelona Scoliosis Physical Therapy School or the International Schroth 3-dimensional Scoliosis Therapy School websites. The survey included 64 questions covering demographics, session and treatment characteristics, and whether therapists included other treatment modalities in their clinical practice. A convenience sample of survey participants were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview to further explore the factors that influenced their prescription of Schroth for AIS. Results from the survey were analyzed descriptively (n, %), whereas inductive thematic analysis was used for the interviews. (3) Results: of the 173 survey respondents (18% response rate), most were from Europe and North America (64.0%), female (78.6%), physiotherapists (96.0%), and worked in private settings (72.3%). Fifty-two per cent of participants used other types of PSSE as an adjunct to Schroth, the Scientific Exercise Approach to Scoliosis (SEAS) being the most frequently used (37.9%). Non-PSSE methods were used 'at some point' as an adjunct by 98.8% of participants, including massage and other soft tissue techniques (80.9%), Pilates (46.6%), and Yoga (31.5%). The Schroth techniques used by all survey respondents included breathing and pelvic corrections. Seven participants were interviewed, but data saturation was achieved after only four interviews. Thematic analysis revealed four, inter-related broad themes describing the factors that influenced Schroth prescription for AIS: (1) the adolescent as a whole, including physical, emotional and mental characteristics, and patient goals, (2) family, including parent relationship with the adolescent and the motivation of parents in regard to Schroth, (3) the systems within which the treatment was being offered, such as vicinity to the clinic and the presence of financial insurance support, and (4) therapist characteristics, such as their training and experience. (4) Conclusions: Schroth therapists worldwide use a variety of adjunctive methods to treat AIS. Therapists prescribing Schroth exercises to AIS consider the complex interplay of intra-, inter- and extra-personal factors in clinical practice. These considerations move beyond the three components of evidence-based practice of research, patient preferences, and clinical expertise, towards a systems-based reflection on exercise prescription.",0
Comparing preference for and use of medication abortion in Texas after policy changes in 2014 and 2018.,"OBJECTIVES: Assess preferences for and use of medication abortion in Texas after implementation of two policy changes: a 2013 state law restricting medication abortion and the FDA label change for mifepristone in 2016 nullifying some of this restriction. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed surveys conducted in 2014 and 2018 with abortion patients at 10 Texas abortion facilities. We calculated the percentage of all respondents with an initial preference for medication abortion by survey year, and the type of abortion obtained or planned to obtain among those who were at <10 weeks of gestation. We used multivariable-adjusted mixed-effects Poisson regression models to assess factors associated with medication abortion preference and actual/planned use. RESULTS: Overall, 156 (41%) of 376 respondents in 2014 and 247 (55%) of 448 respondents in 2018 reported initial preference for medication abortion (Prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.28; 95% CI 1.03-1.59). Among those who were <10 weeks of gestation and initially preferred medication abortion, 39 of 124 (31%) obtained or were planning to obtain the method in 2014, compared with 188 of 223 (84%) in 2018 (PR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.69-4.15). After multivariable adjustment, respondents who initially preferred medication abortion and were 7 to 9 weeks of gestation at the time of their ultrasonography (vs <7 weeks) were less likely to obtain or plan to obtain the method (PR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57-0.84). CONCLUSIONS: Abortion patients were more likely to prefer and obtain or plan to obtain their preferred medication abortion after legal restrictions in Texas were nullified. IMPLICATIONS: State policies can affect people's ability to obtain their preferred abortion method. Efforts to provide both abortion options whenever possible, and inform people where each can be obtained, remains an important component of person-centered care despite increasing state abortion restrictions and bans following the reversal of Roe v Wade.",0
"Patient preferences in geriatric wards, a survey of health care professionals' practice, experience and attitudes.","PURPOSE: We aimed to identify whether health care professionals (HCP) examine their patient and next-of-kin preferences, and to study whether medical decisions follow these preferences. METHOD: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted with multidisciplinary HCP from 12 geriatric wards in the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority. RESULTS: Of the 289 HCPs responding (response rate 61%), mean age 37.8 years (SD 11.3), 235 (81.3%) women, 12.4 (SD 9.6) years of experience and 67 (23.2%) medical doctors, only half report clarifying patients' preferences. The majority reported that they did not inform, involve and treat in line with such preferences. However, 53% believe that HCP, patients and next-of-kin should make clinical decisions together. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate a lack of engagement in conversation and inclusion of patient preferences when providing health interventions in geriatric wards. Measures for change of culture are needed.",0
Enhancing Patient Choice: Using Self-administered Intranasal Naloxone for Novel Rapid Buprenorphine Initiation.,"Buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) is a lifesaving treatment for opioid use disorder. The increasing use of illicitly manufactured fentanyl, however, has made initiating BUP-NX more likely to precipitate withdrawal-an experience that deters treatment and causes return to use. If BUP-NX cannot be successfully started, it cannot work. We describe the case of a patient who was able to transition to a therapeutic dose of BUP-NX less than 3 hours after his last illicitly manufactured fentanyl use by choosing to self-administer intranasal naloxone. After the naloxone, the transition took 31 minutes, including 14 minutes of expected moderately severe withdrawal. He remains in care with BUP-NX and would recommend this transition approach to others.",0
