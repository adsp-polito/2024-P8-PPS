Cancer Survivor Preferences for Models of Breast Cancer Follow-Up Care: Selecting Attributes for Inclusion in a Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It is critical to evaluate cancer survivors' preferences when developing follow-up care models to better address the needs of cancer survivors. This study was conducted to understand the key attributes of breast cancer follow-up care for use in a future discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey. METHODS: Key attributes of breast cancer follow-up care models were generated using a multi-stage, mixed-methods approach. Focus group discussions were conducted with cancer survivors and clinicians to generate a range of attributes of current and ideal follow-up care. These attributes were then prioritised using an online survey with survivors and healthcare providers. The DCE attributes and levels were finalised via an expert panel discussion based on the outcomes of the previous stages. RESULTS: Four focus groups were held, two with breast cancer survivors (n = 7) and two with clinicians (n = 8). Focus groups generated sixteen attributes deemed important for breast cancer follow-up care models. The prioritisation exercise was conducted with 20 participants (14 breast cancer survivors and 6 clinicians). Finally, the expert panel selected five attributes for a future DCE survey tool to elicit cancer survivors' preferences on breast cancer follow-up care. The final attributes included: the care team, allied health and supportive care, survivorship care planning, travel for appointments, and out-of-pocket costs. CONCLUSIONS: Attributes identified can be used in future DCE studies to elicit cancer survivors' preferences for breast cancer follow-up care. This strengthens the design and implementation of follow-up care programs that best suit the needs and expectations of breast cancer survivors.",1
Expert Consensus for the Use of Outpatient Rehabilitation Visits After Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Delphi Study.,"OBJECTIVE: There is no consensus for how to use rehabilitation visits after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We sought to develop expert recommendations for outpatient rehabilitation visit usage after TKA. DESIGN: Delphi study. METHODS: First, we developed a broad list of preliminary visit usage recommendations, which were specific to patients' recovery status (ie, slow, typical, or fast recovery) and time since surgery. We then invited 49 TKA experts to participate on a Delphi panel. During round 1, we surveyed panelists regarding their level of agreement with each preliminary recommendation. We conducted additional Delphi rounds as needed to build consensus, which we defined using the RAND/UCLA method. We updated the survey each round based on panelist feedback and responses from the previous round. RESULTS: Thirty panelists agreed to participate, and 29 panelists completed 2 Delphi rounds. The panel reached consensus on recommendations related to visit frequency, visit timing, and the use of telerehabilitation. The panel recommended that outpatient rehabilitation should begin within 1 week after surgery at a frequency of 2 times per week for the first postoperative month regardless of recovery status. The panel recommended different visit frequencies depending on the patient's recovery status for postoperative months 2 to 3. The panel agreed that telerehabilitation can be recommended for most patients after TKA, but not for patients recovering slowly. CONCLUSION: We used the Delphi process to develop expert recommendations for the use of outpatient rehabilitation visits after TKA. We envision these recommendations could help patients decide how to use visits based on their own preferences. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther 2023;53(9):1-9.

Factors that influence intensive care admission decisions for older people: A systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: The population worldwide is rapidly ageing, and demand for intensive care is increasing. People aged 85 years and above, known as the oldest old, are particularly vulnerable to critical illness owing to the physiological effects of ageing. Evidence surrounding admission of the oldest old to the intensive care is limited. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to systematically and comprehensively review and synthesise the published research investigating factors that influence decisions to admit the oldest old to the intensive care unit. METHOD: This was a systematic review and narrative synthesis. Following a comprehensive search of CINAHL, Embase, and Medline databases, peer-reviewed primary research articles examining factors associated with admission or refusal to admit the oldest old to intensive care were selected. Data were extracted into tables and narratively synthesised. RESULTS: Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Three studies identified factors associated with admission such as greater premorbid self-sufficiency, patient preferences, alignment between patient and physicians' goals of treatment, age less than 85 years, and absence of cancer, or previous intensive care admission. Factors associated with refusal to admit were identified in all six studies and included limited or no bed availability, level of ICU physician experience, patients being deemed too ill or too well to benefit, and older age. CONCLUSIONS: Published research investigating decision-making about admission or refusal to admit the oldest old to the intensive care unit is scant. The ageing population and increasing demand for intensive care unit resources has amplified the need for greater understanding of factors that influence decisions to admit or refuse admission of the oldest old to the intensive care unit. Such knowledge may inform guidelines regarding complex practice decisions about admission of the oldest old to an intensive care unit. Such guidelines would ensure the specialty needs of this population are considered and would reduce admission decisions that might disadvantage older people.",0
Prospective Patient Preferences for Humor in Urologists Treating Erectile Dysfunction: A Survey Study.,"INTRODUCTION: Men seeking treatment for sexual dysfunction can experience embarrassment as a result of stigma. This research manuscript presents the findings of a survey conducted to investigate the influence of humor on prospective patients' preferences when selecting a specialist to address erectile dysfunction (ED). METHODS: The respondents were presented with five pairs of mock urology business cards: one professional and one humorous. A questionnaire was designed and distributed via an online survey platform. Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact test were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 29 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY) to evaluate age and race associations with card preference. RESULTS: Among the 997 participants, an average of 66.1% (a median of 71.2%) preferred professional cards. Humorous card selection rates ranged from 5.2% to 38.4% compared to 54.0% to 78.1% for professional cards. A statistically significant relationship between age and professional card choice existed in all except the fifth set of cards (p = 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, 0.001, and 0.054). The relationship between race or ethnicity and business card preference was not reported due to an imbalance in demographics, with most participants identifying as Caucasian. DISCUSSION: A humor-centric approach may not resonate with all individuals seeking treatment for sensitive conditions such as ED. Limitations include the subjectivity of humor, the use of an online survey platform, and the hypothetical nature of this study. Real patients experiencing ED may face stigma and respond to humor differently. CONCLUSION: This study provides insights into patient preference for professionalism over humor from their urologist but leaves room for the exploration of humor in medical contexts. Future studies could examine the impacts of humor on patient choices in real-world healthcare settings.",0
Clinical Investigation of Large Volume Subcutaneous Delivery up to 25 mL for Lean and Non-Lean Subjects.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical feasibility and tolerability of large volume subcutaneous delivery at different injection depths for lean and non-lean subjects. METHODS: A single-center, randomized, subject-blinded, crossover study in 62 healthy subjects was conducted to evaluate delivery of a 10-cP solution containing hyaluronic acid. Subjects were separated into lean and non-lean cohort by SC thickness. A syringe pump was used to study the effect of different volumes (5, 12, 25 mL) of a viscous placebo solution and needle lengths (6, 9 and 12 mm) delivered at 0.5 mL/min. RESULTS: Across all treatments, injection sites were observed to have negligible leakage, ~34 kPa of back pressure, and VAS of mild pain with higher pain from needle insertion than during injection. While mild to moderate erythema was the most frequently reported ISR and edema was most prominent for 25 mL injections, all ISRs were resolved within 4 hours post injection. Subjects were unbothered by ISRs across all treatments and rated them as low distress scores (average 1.0-1.5 out of 6). CONCLUSION: SC injection of 25 mL is feasible and tolerable using a low-pain formulation for abdomen injection irrespective of subcutaneous thickness and injection depths at a delivery rate of 0.5 mL/min.",0
Patient Preference Trade-offs for Next-Generation Kidney Replacement Therapies.,"BACKGROUND: Next-generation implantable and wearable KRTs may revolutionize the lives of patients undergoing dialysis by providing more frequent and/or prolonged therapy along with greater mobility compared with in-center hemodialysis. Medical device innovators would benefit from patient input to inform product design and development. Our objective was to determine key risk/benefit considerations for patients with kidney failure and test how these trade-offs could drive patient treatment choices. METHODS: We developed a choice-based conjoint discrete choice instrument and surveyed 498 patients with kidney failure. The choice-based conjoint instrument consisted of nine attributes of risk and benefit pertinent across KRT modalities. Attributes were derived from literature reviews, patient/clinician interviews, and pilot testing. The risk attributes were serious infection, death within 5 years, permanent device failure, surgical requirements, and follow-up requirements. The benefit attributes were fewer diet restrictions, improved mobility, pill burden, and fatigue. We created a random, full-profile, balanced overlap design with 14 choice pairs plus five fixed tasks to test validity. We used a mixed-effects regression model with attribute levels as independent predictor variables and choice decisions as dependent variables. RESULTS: All variables were significantly important to patient choice preferences, except follow-up requirements. For each 1% higher risk of death within 5 years, preference utility was lower by 2.22 ( β =-2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.52 to -1.91), while for each 1% higher risk of serious infection, utility was lower by 1.38 ( β =-1.46; 95% CI, -1.77 to -1.00) according to comparisons of the β coefficients. Patients were willing to trade a 1% infection risk and 0.5% risk of death to gain complete mobility and freedom from in-center hemodialysis ( β =1.46; 95% CI, 1.27 to 1.64). CONCLUSIONS: Despite an aversion to even a 1% higher risk of death within 5 years, serious infection, and permanent device rejection, patients with kidney failure suggested that they would trade these risks for the benefit of complete mobility.",1
A cross-sectional study evaluating patients' preferences for Salter innominate osteotomy.,"BACKGROUND: Residual acetabular dysplasia in children after reduction of hip dislocation is often treated using Salter innominate osteotomy to prevent future osteoarthritis. Preventive surgery for asymptomatic patients, which could result in overtreatment, should be carefully applied with consideration of patients' opinions. In this study, we aimed to describe opinions on Salter innominate osteotomy as preventive surgery for children among adult patients who had undergone periacetabular osteotomy for hip pain due to hip dysplasia. METHODS: A mail-in questionnaire survey was conducted with 77 patients who underwent periacetabular osteotomy. Participants responded whether they would recommend Salter innominate osteotomy as preventive surgery for children and the reason for their opinion. We also performed a patient-based evaluation using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association Hip-Disease Evaluation Questionnaire and assessed clinical outcome measures with the Japanese Orthopedic Association score. Their recommendations and reasons were evaluated, and associations between their opinions and demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-three patients (56%) responded to the questionnaire. Of these, 10 (23%) patients recommended undergoing Salter innominate osteotomy, 28 (65%) patients did not, and 5 (12%) patients responded they were undecided. No significant association was observed between their opinions and demographic/clinical characteristics evaluated in the survey. The most frequent reason for why they do not recommend Salter innominate osteotomy was related to uncertainty about future hip pain. CONCLUSIONS: In total, 65% of the study participants did not recommend Salter innominate osteotomy for children with risk of dysplasia in the future. Participants' preferences regarding preventive surgery were not influenced by demographic and clinical characteristics.",0
Effect of protocol-based family visitation on physiological indicators in ICU patients: a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) patients often experience significant physiological stress. This study evaluated the effect of a defined family visitation protocol on physiological responses in the ICU. METHODS: A randomized, block-randomized clinical trial was conducted on 78 ICU patients at Imam Reza Hospital between February 8, 2017, and August 8, 2017. The intervention group received protocol-based visits, and the control group continued with standard visitation. Block randomization was utilized for group assignments. The primary outcome was the measurement of physiological signs using designated monitoring devices. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22, employing independent t-tests, Mann-Whitney U test, repeated measures analysis, and Friedman's test. RESULTS: The results showed no significant differences in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, and arterial blood oxygen levels between the two groups. However, heart rate in the intervention group was significantly lower in three stages before, during, and after the meaningful visiting (P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Protocol-based scheduled family visits in the ICU may reduce physiological stress, as evidenced by a decrease in patients' heart rate. Implementing tailored visitation protocols sensitive to patient preferences and clinical contexts is advisable, suggesting the integration of family visits into standard care practices for enhanced patient outcomes.

"""I want to stay here"": Patient and staff perspectives on transitioning from a low-threshold buprenorphine program to clinic-based care.","BACKGROUND: The Project Connections At Re-Entry (PCARE) Van is a low-threshold buprenorphine program operating outside the Baltimore City Detention Center. Like other low-threshold programs, PCARE seeks to engage a vulnerable population in care, stabilize patients, then transition patients to longer-term care; however, <10% of patients transition to clinic-based buprenorphine treatment. Our goal was to better understand these low transition rates and center patient perspectives in discussion of broader low-threshold program design. METHODS: From December 2022 to June 2023, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 former and current PCARE patients and 6 staff members. We used deductive and inductive coding followed by thematic content analysis to identify themes around treatment experiences and care preferences. RESULTS: There were strong preferences among current and former patients for continuing buprenorphine treatment at the PCARE Van. Several themes emerged from the data that explained patient preferences, including both advantages to continuing care at the van (preference for continuity, feeling respected by the program's structure and philosophy) and disadvantages to transitioning to a clinic (perceived harms associated with rigid or punitive care models). Staff noted limited program capacity, and patients expressed that if needed, they would transition to a clinic for altruistic reasons. Staff expressed varied perspectives on low-threshold care, emphasizing both larger systems factors, as well as beliefs about individual patient responsibility. CONCLUSIONS: While many low-threshold care settings are designed as transitional bridge models, this research highlights patient preference for long-term care at low-threshold programs and supports efforts to adapt low-threshold models to be sustainable as longitudinal care.",0
An Actionable Expert-System Algorithm to Support Nurse-Led Cancer Survivorship Care: Algorithm Development Study.,"BACKGROUND: Comprehensive models of survivorship care are necessary to improve access to and coordination of care. New models of care provide the opportunity to address the complexity of physical and psychosocial problems and long-term health needs experienced by patients following cancer treatment. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents our expert-informed, rules-based survivorship algorithm to build a nurse-led model of survivorship care to support men living with prostate cancer (PCa). The algorithm is called No Evidence of Disease (Ned) and supports timelier decision-making, enhanced safety, and continuity of care. METHODS: An initial rule set was developed and refined through working groups with clinical experts across Canada (eg, nurse experts, physician experts, and scientists; n=20), and patient partners (n=3). Algorithm priorities were defined through a multidisciplinary consensus meeting with clinical nurse specialists, nurse scientists, nurse practitioners, urologic oncologists, urologists, and radiation oncologists (n=17). The system was refined and validated using the nominal group technique. RESULTS: Four levels of alert classification were established, initiated by responses on the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice survey, and mediated by changes in minimal clinically important different alert thresholds, alert history, and clinical urgency with patient autonomy influencing clinical acuity. Patient autonomy was supported through tailored education as a first line of response, and alert escalation depending on a patient-initiated request for a nurse consultation. CONCLUSIONS: The Ned algorithm is positioned to facilitate PCa nurse-led care models with a high nurse-to-patient ratio. This novel expert-informed PCa survivorship care algorithm contains a defined escalation pathway for clinically urgent symptoms while honoring patient preference. Though further validation is required through a pragmatic trial, we anticipate the Ned algorithm will support timelier decision-making and enhance continuity of care through the automation of more frequent automated checkpoints, while empowering patients to self-manage their symptoms more effectively than standard care.

Evidence-based Management of Left Main Coronary Artery Disease.,"Left main coronary artery disease (LMCAD) is associated with high morbidity and mortality due to the large myocardial mass at risk. Although medical treatment may be an option in selected low-risk patients, revascularisation is recommended to improve survival in the majority of patients presenting with a significant left main stenosis. In the past decade, multiple randomised clinical trials and meta-analyses have compared coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) versus percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), finding controversial results. The strategy for LMCAD revascularisation is still challenging. Coronary anatomy complexity, clinical features and patient preferences are key elements to be considered by the heart team. The current guidelines define CABG as standard therapy, but the continuous improvements in PCI techniques, the use of intracoronary imaging and functional assessment make PCI a feasible alternative in selected patients, particularly in those with comorbidities and contraindications to CABG. This review analyses the most important studies comparing CABG versus PCI in patients with LMCAD.",0
Older adult patient preferences for the content and format of prescription medication labels - A best-worst scaling and discrete choice experiment study.,"BACKGROUND: Patient preferences for the content and format of prescription medication labels (PMLs, i.e., sticker labels placed on medication bottles/packets at dispensing) have been extensively studied. However, accommodating all preferences on PMLs is impractical due to space limitations. Understanding how patients prioritise the content and format attributes of PMLs can inform improvements while working within PML space constraints. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to (1) identify a ranking of medication-related content attributes to be prioritised on PMLs using best-worst scaling (BWS), and (2) determine the relative importance of format attributes when incorporated onto PMLs using discrete choice experiment (DCE), from the perspective of older adult patients in Singapore. METHODS: Attributes were informed by our prior qualitative study and PML best practice guidelines. For the BWS component, the assessed content attributes were indication, precautions, interaction or paired medicines, food instructions, side effects, expiry date, and missed dose action, all of which are currently not legally mandated on PMLs in Singapore. A BWS object case was used to rank the content attributes. For the DCE component, in a series of questions, participants were asked to choose between two PML options each time, that varied in the presentation of dosage-frequency instructions, font size, presentation of dosage, presentation of precautions, and font colour of precautions. A mixed logit model estimated the relative utilities of format attribute levels, enabling the calculation of importance scores of the format attributes. RESULTS: The study recruited 280 participants (mean age: 68.8 ± 5.4 years). The three most-preferred content attributes were indication, precautions and interaction or paired medicines. The top three format preferences were tabular style presentation of dosage-frequency instructions, large font size and precautions in red colour. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare institutions should consider improving their PMLs based on the leading content and format preferences voiced by older adult patients. The methodology adopted in the study can also be used for aligning the content and format of other patient education materials with patient preferences.",1
"A Prospective, Randomized Single-Blind Crossover Study Comparing High-Frequency 10,000 Hz and Burst Spinal Cord Stimulation.","OBJECTIVES: Although both high-frequency and burst spinal cord stimulation (SCS) have shown improved efficacy and patient satisfaction compared with conventional tonic stimulation, there are limited data directly comparing the two. This study aimed to compare both high-frequency 10,000 Hz and burst SCS in the same patients in terms of pain relief and satisfaction in those with axial back pain with or without leg pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted at an outpatient pain clinic within an academic medical center. Participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups in which they trialed either burst or high-frequency 10,000 Hz SCS over five days, followed by a 24- to 48-hour washout period with no stimulation, and the alternative therapy over the remaining four days. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were collected immediately before and after both therapy trials. Secondary end points included percentage change in VAS score and patient preference. RESULTS: Of 25 participants, those receiving burst followed by high-frequency SCS (n = 11) had a mean VAS difference of 4.73 after the first trial period and 2.86 after the second. Of those receiving high-frequency followed by burst SCS (n = 14), mean VAS difference after the first trial period was 4.00 and 1.93 after the second trial period. Four participants were withdrawn owing to lead migration. Both therapies showed statistically significant differences in pre- minus post-VAS scores and percent relief. There were no significant differences in carryover or treatment effects between the two groups. There was a statistically significant association between trial sequence and stimulator type implanted because the first stimulator trialed was more likely to be chosen. CONCLUSIONS: There were no observed differences in VAS pain score decrease when comparing burst and high-frequency 10,000 Hz SCS programming therapies. Patient preference followed an order effect, favoring the first programming therapy in the trial sequence.",0
Evaluation of patient participation in relation to the implementation of a person-centered nursing shift handover.,"BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that nursing shift-to-shift handover should be a more team-based dialogue with and for the patient rather than about a patient. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate patient participation in relation to the implementation of the person-centered handover (PCH). METHOD: A pretest-posttest design was used without a comparison group, including patients from nine units in a university hospital at pretest (n = 228) and after implementing PCH (posttest, n = 253) per the framework integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services. The PCH is inspired by an Australian bedside handover model. The Patient Preferences for the Patient Participation tool was used to rate the preference for and experience of participation on 12 items, combined into three levels of preference-based participation (insufficient-fair-sufficient). RESULTS: There were no differences regarding experience or preference-based participation between patients at pretest-posttest; however, posttest patients experienced participation in the item Reciprocal communication to a lesser extent than the pretest patients. Only 49% of the posttest group received PCH; of those not receiving PCH, some would have wanted PCH (27%), while some would have declined (24%). Patients receiving PCH had sufficient participation (82%), to a greater extent, regarding the item Sharing one's symptoms with staff than patients at pretest (72%). Patients receiving PCH also had sufficient participation, to a greater extent, than patients at posttest who did not receive, but would have wanted PCH, regarding four items: (1) sharing one's symptoms with staff, (2) reciprocal communication, (3) being told what was done, and (4) taking part in planning. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Most patients want to be present at PCH. Therefore, nurses should ask for the patients' preferences regarding PCH and act accordingly. Not inviting patients who want PCH could contribute to insufficient patient participation. Further studies are needed to capture what assistance nurses would want in identifying and acting in alignment with patient preferences.",0
Understanding Patient Preferences Regarding the Important Determinants of Breast Cancer Treatment: A Narrative Scoping Review.,"OBJECTIVE: Conventionally, optimal treatment strategies for breast cancer have been largely determined by physicians, with a scant understanding of patients' treatment values and preferences. Incorporating patient preferences in the decision-making process for breast cancer treatment is gaining recognition and can potentially improve treatment outcomes and compliance. This scoping review aims to synthesize evidence on the key determinants that are most valued by breast cancer patients when deciding on their treatment options. METHODS: We searched three electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and CINAHL Plus) utilizing a systematic scoping review method. Two reviewers independently screened, applied inclusion criteria, reviewed, and synthesized findings. A mixed-method narrative approach combining the inductive thematic analysis and content analysis methodologies was used to synthesize and summarize the findings. RESULTS: The review included 22 studies, leading to the conceptualization of 5 overarching themes and 17 sub-themes. Among these, the most frequently cited theme was treatment benefits, followed by treatment-related process, treatment-related risk, quality of life, and cost of treatment. Women with breast cancer highly value treatments that offer good effectiveness, prolong survival, prevent recurrence, and maintain quality of life. Patient concerns include treatment-related side effects, safety, the risk of secondary cancer, and direct or indirect out-of-pocket costs. Additionally, patients also consider treatment duration, mode of administration, physician recommendation, and treatment availability and accessibility when deciding on their preferred treatment. CONCLUSION: The evidence synthesized in this review offers insights into refining breast cancer treatment strategies to align more closely with patient values. Recognizing and integrating patient perspectives in breast cancer care could potentially lead to improved treatment outcomes, enhanced patient compliance, and more personalized care. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to incorporate these key determinants in their treatment decision-making processes, aiming to deliver a patient-centered care that aligns with the unique preferences and values of each patient.",1
Report of consensus panel 2 from the 11th international workshop on Waldenström's macroglobulinemia on the management of relapsed or refractory WM patients.,"The consensus panel 2 (CP2) of the 11th International Workshop on Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (IWWM-11) has reviewed and incorporated current data to update the recommendations for treatment approaches in patients with relapsed or refractory WM (RRWM). The key recommendations from IWWM-11 CP2 include: (1) Chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) and/or a covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase (cBTKi) strategies are important options; their use should reflect the prior upfront strategy and are subject to their availability. (2) In selecting treatment, biological age, co-morbidities and fitness are important; nature of relapse, disease phenotype and WM-related complications, patient preferences and hematopoietic reserve are also critical factors while the composition of the BM disease and mutational status (MYD88, CXCR4, TP53) should also be noted. (3) The trigger for initiating treatment in RRWM should utilize knowledge of patients' prior disease characteristics to avoid unnecessary delays. (4) Risk factors for cBTKi related toxicities (cardiovascular dysfunction, bleeding risk and concurrent medication) should be addressed when choosing cBTKi. Mutational status (MYD88, CXCR4) may influence the cBTKi efficacy, and the role of TP53 disruptions requires further study) in the event of cBTKi failure dose intensity could be up titrated subject to toxicities. Options after BTKi failure include CIT with a non-cross-reactive regimen to one previously used CIT, addition of anti-CD20 antibody to BTKi, switching to a newer cBTKi or non-covalent BTKi, proteasome inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors, and new anti-CD20 combinations are additional options. Clinical trial participation should be encouraged for all patients with RRWM.",0
Evaluation of Preference and Utility Measures for Transoral Thyroidectomy.,"BACKGROUND: Traditional, trans-cervical thyroidectomy results in the presence of a neck scar, which has been shown to correlate with lower quality of life and lower patient satisfaction. Transoral thyroid surgery (TOTS) has been utilized as an alternative approach to avoid a cutaneous incision and scar by accessing the neck and thyroid through the oral cavity. This study was designed to evaluate patient preference through health-state utility scores for TOTS as compared to conventional trans-cervical thyroidectomy. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, patient preferences were elicited for TOTS and trans-cervical thyroidectomy with the use of an online survey. Respondents were asked to consider 4 hypothetical health scenarios involving thyroid surgery with varying approaches. Health-state utility scores were elicited using visual analog scale and standard gamble exercises. RESULTS: Overall, 516 respondents completed the survey, of whom 261 (50.6%) were included for analysis, with a mean age of 41.5 years (SD 14.9 years), including 171 (65.5%) females. Health utility scores were similar for TOTS and conventional transcervical techniques. Statistically significant differences in the standard gamble utility score were noted for gender and ethnicity across all scenarios. Comparisons of visual analog score utilities were not statistically significant based on respondent demographics. CONCLUSION: Preferences for TOTS and trans-cervical thyroidectomy did not significantly differ in the current study. Females and white ethnicity indicated stronger preference for a TOTs approach compared to males and other ethnicities, respectively. Some literature suggests certain types of patients who might prefer minimally invasive thyroidectomy more so than other patients-in keeping with the current findings of this study.",1
Clinical documentation of patient identities in the electronic health record: Ethical principles to consider.,"The American Psychological Association's multicultural guidelines encourage psychologists to use language sensitive to the lived experiences of the individuals they serve. In organized care settings, psychologists have important decisions to make about the language they use in the electronic health record (EHR), which may be accessible to both the patient and other health care providers. Language about patient identities (including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation) is especially important, but little guidance exists for psychologists on how and when to document these identities in the EHR. Moreover, organizational mandates, patient preferences, fluid identities, and shifting language may suggest different documentation approaches, posing ethical dilemmas for psychologists to navigate. In this article, we review the purposes of documentation in organized care settings, review how each of the five American Psychological Association Code of Ethics' General Principles relates to identity language in EHR documentation, and propose a set of questions for psychologists to ask themselves and their patients when making choices about documenting identity variables in the EHR.

Public preferences in healthcare resource allocation: A discrete choice experiment in South Korea.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the public view on priority-setting criteria for healthcare resource allocation. Specifically, it investigates how the value of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) varies depending on patient characteristics. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was conducted using an online sample of the general South Korean population. Respondents were presented with two competing treatment scenarios. The attributes of the scenarios were age at disease onset, life expectancy without treatment, life-years gain with treatment, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) without treatment, and HRQoL gains with treatment. Two hundred choice sets were generated and randomly allocated into 20 blocks. A conditional logit model was used to estimate the factors affecting the respondents' choices. RESULTS: A total of 3,482 respondents completed the survey. The larger the QALY gain, the more likely it was that the scenario would be chosen but with a diminishing marginal value. Respondents prioritized 40-year-old patients over 5-year-olds and 5-year-olds over 70-year-olds and prioritized baseline HRQoL of 40% and 60% over 20%. Patients at the end of life were not preferred to those with a longer life expectancy. CONCLUSION: Overall, respondents preferred health-maximizing options without explicit consideration for end-of-life patients or those with poor health. In addition, they revealed a kinked preference for patient age, prioritizing middle-aged patients over children and older people.",1
Patients' Expectations and Preferences for the Organizational Conditions of the Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme in Poland: A Qualitative Analysis.,"(1) Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a serious health problem in Poland as well as many European Union countries. The study aimed to describe factors that, from the patient's perspective, could increase the attendance rate and regularity of participation in the colorectal cancer screening programme (SP); (2) Methods: The qualitative approach was applied. The study involved six focus interviews conducted with 24 respondents (12 women and 12 men) aged 40-49, who had at least one first-degree family member diagnosed with CRC and persons aged 50-65, living in five selected voivodships (provinces) of Poland. The collected data were thematically coded. Further, a comparative analysis was conducted, and aggregated statements were formulated; (3) Results: The inclusion of primary care clinics within the CRC SP organization was reported as a key factor in improving the attendance rate and regularity of patient participation in the programme. Particularly important factors included an invitation in the form of a personal letter or a phone call made by staff from primary care clinics; (4) Conclusions: Patients were confirmed to have clear expectations and preferences for the organizational conditions of the CRC SP. Preferences nature allows them to be treated as one of the potential criteria for selecting critical parameters of CRC SPs.",0
Epilepsy surgery perceptions among general neurologists and epilepsy specialists: A survey.,"OBJECTIVE: Surgical intervention for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) is a safe and efficacious evidence-based treatment. Yet, neurologists have historically revealed hesitance in referring patients for surgical evaluations. The present study surveyed general neurologists and epilepsy specialists to assess their views and process in referring patients for specialized epilepsy care and epilepsy surgery. METHODS: A 14-item survey assessing epilepsy referrals and views of epilepsy surgery was distributed to all neurologists currently practicing in a large national integrated health system using REDCap. Responses were qualitatively analyzed and differences between general neurologists and epileptologists were assessed using chi-squared tests. RESULTS: In total, 100 responses were received from 67 general neurologists and 33 epileptologists with several similarities and differences emerging between the two groups. Both groups endorsed surgery and neuromodulation as treatment options in DRE, felt that seizure frequency rather than duration was relevant in considering epilepsy surgery, and indicated patient preference as the largest barrier limiting epilepsy surgery. General neurologists were more likely to require ≥ 3 ASMs to fail to diagnose DRE compared to epileptologists (45% vs. 15%, p < 0.01) who more often required ≥ 2 ASMs to fail. Epileptologists were also more likely than neurologists to try a new ASM (75.8% vs. 53.7%, p < 0.05) or optimize the current ASM (75.8% vs. 49.3%, p < 0.05) in DRE. General neurologists were more likely to consider epilepsy surgery to be less efficacious (p = 0.001) or less safe (p < 0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, neurologists appear to have generally positive opinions of epilepsy surgery, which is a change from prior literature and represents a changing landscape of views toward this intervention. Furthermore, epileptologists and general neurologists endorsed more similarities than differences in their opinions of surgery and steps to referral, which is another encouraging finding. Those gaps that remain between epileptologists and general neurologists, particularly in standards of ASM prescription, may be addressed by more consistent education about DRE and streamlining of surgical referral procedures.",0
Communication Preferences During Pregnancy Care Among Patients With Primary Spanish Language: A Scoping Review.,"BACKGROUND: Qualified language service providers (QLSPs)-professional interpreters or multilingual clinicians certified to provide care in another language-are critical to ensuring meaningful language access for patients. Designing patient-centered systems for language access could improve quality of pregnancy care. OBJECTIVE: We synthesized and identified gaps in knowledge about communication preferences during pregnancy care among patients with Spanish primary language. METHODS: We performed a scoping review of original research studies published between 2000 and 2022 that assessed communication preferences in Spanish-speaking populations during pregnancy care. Studies underwent title, abstract, and full-text review by three investigators. Data were extracted for synthesis and thematic analysis. RESULTS: We retrieved 1,539 studies. After title/abstract screening, 36 studies underwent full-text review, and 13 of them met inclusion criteria. Two additional studies were included after reference tracing. This yielded a total of 15 studies comprising qualitative (n = 7), quantitative (n = 4), and mixed-methods (n = 4) studies. Three communication preference themes were identified: language access through QLSPs (n = 7); interpersonal dynamics and perceptions of quality of care (n = 9); and information provision and shared decision-making (n = 8). Although seven studies reported a strong patient preference to receive prenatal care from Spanish-speaking clinicians, none of the included studies assessed clinician Spanish language proficiency or QLSP categorization. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have assessed communication preferences during pregnancy care among patients with primary Spanish language. Future studies to improve communication during pregnancy care for patients with primary Spanish language require intentional analysis of their communication preferences, including precision regarding language proficiency among clinicians.",0
Efficacy of different bowel preparation regimen volumes for colorectal cancer screening and compliance with European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy performance measures.,"BACKGROUND: Various volumes of bowel preparation are used in clinical practice. There is conflicting data on the effectiveness of individual regimens. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and compliance of currently used bowel preparations with the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) performance measures using data of the Dutch nationwide colorectal cancer screening (CRC) program. METHODS: In a prospective, multicenter endoscopy database, we identified all CRC screening colonoscopies performed in 15 Dutch endoscopy centers from 2016 to 2020. We excluded procedures without documented bowel preparation or the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) score. Bowel preparation regimens were categorized into three groups, that is, 4-L (polyethylene glycol (PEG)), 2-L (2-L PEG with ascorbic acid) and ≤1-L volumes (sodium picosulfate with magnesium citrate, 1L-PEG with sodium sulfate and ascorbic acid or oral sulfate solution). European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy performance measures included adequate BBPS score (≥6) (>90%), cecal intubation rate (CIR, >90%), adenoma detection rate (ADR, >25%) and polyp detection rate (PDR, >40%). Logistic regression was performed to identify predictive factors for adequate BBPS and patient discomfort. RESULTS: A total of 39,042 CRC screening colonoscopies were included. Boston Bowel Preparation Scale scores, CIR, ADR and PDR for 4L, 2L and ≤1L regimens all met the minimum ESGE performance measures standards. However, an adequate BBPS score was more frequently seen with 2L regimens (98.0%) as compared to 4L (97.1%) and ≤1L regimens (97.0%) (p < 0.001), respectively. In addition, CIR was higher for ≤1L (98.4%) versus 4L (97.7%) and 2L (97.9%) regimens (p = 0.001), ADR higher for lower volume (≤1L (60.0%) and 2L (61.2)) versus higher volume (4L (58.6%)) regimens (p < 0.001), and PDR higher for ≤1L (70.0%) and 2L (70.8%) versus 4L (67.2%) regimens (p < 0.001). Boston Bowel Preparation Scale for ≤1L regimens was higher when combined with bisacodyl (97.3%) than without (95.6%) (p < 0.001). Overall, bisacodyl use was independently associated with higher patient discomfort (odds ratios = 1.47, confidence intervals = 1.26-1.72). CONCLUSIONS: Despite variations in bowel preparation volumes, all regimens meet the minimum ESGE performance measures for bowel preparation and other quality parameters. Boston Bowel Preparation Scale can be further improved if ultra low volume regimens are combined with bisacodyl. The choice for either bowel preparation volume can therefore be based on volume-tolerance and patient preference.",0
SAMCEP Society consensus on the treatment of upper facial lines with botulinum neurotoxin type A: A tailored approach.,"BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNTA) treatments are well established, but injection techniques, target muscles, and toxin doses continue to evolve, with each refinement producing improvements in treatment outcomes. The recommendations in this consensus move away from standard templates and illustrate how to tailor treatments to individual patterns and strengths of muscle activity, and patient preferences. METHODS: Seventeen experts in the fields of plastic surgery, dermatology, ophthalmology, otorhinolaryngology, and neurology convened in 2022 to develop consensus-based recommendations for the use of botulinum toxin A for the treatment of horizontal forehead lines, glabellar frown lines, and crow's feet lines that reflect current clinical practice. The focus was on how to tailor injections to individual patients to optimize treatment outcomes. RESULTS: For each upper face indication, consensus members describe how to perform a dynamic assessment to optimize the dose and injection technique for each patient. A tailored treatment protocol is presented for commonly observed patterns of dynamic lines. Units of Inco are defined and the precise location of injection points, illustrated with the use of anatomical images. CONCLUSION: This consensus provides up-to-date recommendations on the tailored treatment of upper facial lines based on the latest research and collective clinical experience of the expert injectors. Optimal outcomes require thorough patient evaluation, both at rest and during animation, using both visual and tactile cues; detailed understanding of facial muscular anatomy and how opposing muscles interact; and use of a BoNTA with high precision to target identified zones of excess muscle activity.",0

Doctors' attitudes in the situation of delivering bad news: patients' experience and expectations.,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of our research was to find out patients' preferences concerning their doctors' attitudes and behaviour as they deliver bad news to them. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In national research conducted from February to October 2017 using the computer-assisted web interview (CAWI) technique, we studied the statements of 314 adult patients who had received bad medical news from their doctors. Seventy-nine per cent of them were women and 21% were men. Fifty-nine per cent had higher education and 33% had secondary education. A specially designed closed question survey was used as a tool to collect the data. RESULTS: Most of the patients (59.6%) expected a doctor-patient relationship based on partnership and collective decisions concerning further treatment. Patients wanted their doctors to be honest with them, to provide them with solid information and an opportunity to ask questions and discuss the suggested solutions. Less than 2 out of 10 patients expected ""an empathy specialist"". The patients who evaluated their doctors' behaviour and the way bad news was delivered to them negatively were more likely to change doctors or terminate their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The doctor-patient relationship when an unfavourable diagnosis is being communicated is an important aspect, which defines the way people who participate in this difficult situation behave and communicate. Doctors' behaviour during DBN should meet the patients' expectations. Such an attitude guarantees trust towards doctors and results in more positive evaluations on them. Most importantly, it translates directly into the patients' therapeutic behaviours and treatment effects.",0
An Overview of the Methodology Used to Develop Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Acute and Intraoperative Spinal Cord Injury.,"STUDY DESIGN: An overview of the methods used to develop clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). OBJECTIVES: Acute spinal cord injury (SCI) and intraoperative SCI (ISCI) can have devastating physical and psychological consequences for patients and their families. To date, there are several studies that have discussed the diagnostic and management strategies for both SCI and ISCI. CPGs in SCI help to distill and translate the current evidence into actionable recommendations, standardize care across centers, optimize patient outcomes, and reduce costs and unnecessary interventions. Furthermore, they can be used by patients to assist in making decisions about certain treatments and by policy makers to inform allocation of resources. The objective of this article is to summarize the methods used to develop CPGs for the timing of surgery and hemodynamic management of acute SCI, as well as the identification and treatment of ISCI. METHODS: The CPGs were developed using standards established by the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine), the Guideline International Network and several other organizations. Systematic reviews were conducted according to accepted methodological standards (eg, Institute of Medicine, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute) in order to summarize the current body of evidence and inform the guideline development process. Protocols for each guideline were created. A multidisciplinary guideline development group (GDG) was formed that included individuals living with SCI as well as clinicians from the broad range of specialties that encounter patients with SCI: spine or trauma surgeons, critical care physicians, rehabilitation specialists, neurologists, anesthesiologists and other healthcare professionals. Individuals living with SCI were also included in the GDG. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach was used to rate the certainty of the evidence for each critical outcome. The ""evidence to recommendation"" framework was then used to translate the evidence obtained from the systematic review to an actionable recommendation. This framework provides structure when assessing the body of evidence and considers several additional factors when rating the strength of the recommendation, including the magnitude of benefits and harms, patient preferences, resource use, health equities, acceptability and feasibility. Finally, the CPGs were appraised both internally and externally. RESULTS: The results of the CPGs for SCI are provided in separate articles in this focus issue. CONCLUSIONS: Development of these CPGs for SCI followed the methodology proposed by the Institute of Medicine the Guideline International Network and the GRADE Working Group. It is anticipated that these CPGs will assist clinicians implement the best evidence into practice and facilitate shared-decision making with patients.",0
A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol to Establish How Common Clinical Acupoint Stimulation-Related Therapies Should Be Used for Managing Insomnia.,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have now investigated the effects of common clinical acupoint stimulation-related therapies (ASRTs) following the meridian theory of traditional Chinese medicine for the management of insomnia. However, ASRT choice is currently based on personal clinical experience or patient preference. This study will review the common ASRTs reported in clinical trials and analyze their efficacy and safety for managing insomnia with or without co-morbidities. METHODS: English and Chinese databases will be thoroughly searched, and other potentially eligible trials will be obtained by reviewing reference lists of identified studies and previous reviews. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of common clinical ASRTs to manage insomnia published in peer-reviewed journals will be considered. Sleep quality questionnaires or indices will be considered as the main outcome, while the secondary outcomes will include sleep parameters, daytime dysfunction, quality of life, and adverse effects. Two reviewers will independently investigate eligible RCTs, extract information, analyze their methodological quality, and employ Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to evaluate the strength of the evidence. The treatment impact of various ASRTs will be calculated using meta-analysis techniques, and the degree of study heterogeneity will be assessed using Cochrane's Q and I-squared statistics. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be used to evaluate the reliability of the results. RESULTS: Our systematic review and meta-analysis will present up-to-date evidence on: 1) which common clinical ASRTs are beneficial for the management of insomnia; and 2) whether the effects of common clinical ASRTs on insomnia vary depending on clinical, participant, and treatment characteristics. CONCLUSION: The results of our review should help decision-makers make educated choices regarding evidence-based non-pharmacological management options for insomnia.

Study within a trial of electronic versus paper-based Patient-Reported oUtcomes CollEction (SPRUCE): study protocol for a partially randomised patient preference study.,"INTRODUCTION: Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) are currently collected from trial participants using paper questionnaires by the Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR-CTSU). Streamlining PRO collection using electronic questionnaires (ePRO) may improve data collection and patient experience. Here, we outline our protocol for a Study within a trial of electronic versus paper-based Patient-Reported oUtcomes CollEction (SPRUCE), which investigates the acceptability of ePRO in oncology clinical trials. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: SPRUCE was developed alongside patient and public contributors. SPRUCE runs in multiple host trials with a partially randomised patient preference design, allowing participants to be randomised or choose their preference of electronic or paper questionnaires. Questionnaires are scheduled in accordance with host trial follow-up. The primary objective will assess differences in return rates (compliance) between ePRO and paper PROs at the first timepoint post-host trial intervention in the randomised group. Paper PRO compliance is expected to be 90%. 244 randomised participants are required to exclude ≤80% compliance rates with ePRO (10% non-inferiority margin, with 80% power and one-sided alpha=0.05). SPRUCE aims to assess acceptability of ePRO in oncology clinical trials, establish whether ePRO is acceptable to ICR-CTSU trial participants and can capture complete PRO data, consistent with paper PROs. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The SPRUCE protocol (ICR-CTSU/2021/10074) was approved by the Coventry and Warwick Central Research Ethics Committee (21/WM/0223) on 21 October 2021. Results will be disseminated via presentations, publications and lay summaries. No participant identifiable data will be included. TRIAL REGISTRATION: SWAT169.",0
Physical therapists' perspectives of patient values and their place in clinical practice: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: In physical therapy practice patients and therapists exchange their perspectives on musculoskeletal health problems and their meaning for both of them. However, literature indicates that physical therapists find it difficult to enquire about the patients' values during clinical encounters. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to gain deeper insight into the perspectives of physical therapists about patient values. DESIGN: Explorative qualitative focus group study. METHOD: Twenty-three physical therapists were interviewed in the Netherlands from March to May 2021. Two researchers analyzed the interviews and derived relevant codes. After an iterative process of comparing, analyzing, conceptualizing and discussing the codes, themes were identified through a thematic framework, illustrated with meaningful quotes. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified: Humane, Tacit, and Responsive. It appeared that patient values play unconsciously a major role in daily practice and are associated with humanity, not technical or procedural aspects of the encounter. Responsive denotes that all values require interaction in which aligning with the individual patient forms the basis of treatment. Barriers for being responsive are identified as subthemes: Choices, Trust, Diverseness, and Boundaries. CONCLUSION: The concept of patient values appeared to be implicit. The professional intuitively attunes as a fellow human being to values and expectations of the individual patient. This study contributes to finding a balance and mutual reinforcement of implicit and explicit knowledge. With all found experiences and insights the concept of patient values became more explicit in physical therapy to create a framework for education and research in the future.",0
Do preferences differ based on respondent experience of a health issue and its treatment? A case study using a public health intervention.,"OBJECTIVES: Preference information is increasingly being elicited to support decision-making. Although discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are commonly used, little is known about how respondents' relative experience of a health issue, and its treatment, might impact the results of preference studies. The aim of this study was to explore how preferences differ between groups of individuals with varying levels of experience of a health issue and its treatment, using a weight loss maintenance (WLM) programme as a case study. METHODS: An online DCE survey was provided to four groups, each differing in their level of experience with weight loss and WLM programmes. One group was recruited from a randomised controlled trial of a WLM programme (ISRCTN14657176) and the other three from an online panel. Choice data were analysed using mixed logit models. Relative attribute importance scores and willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates were estimated to enable comparisons between groups. RESULTS: Preferences differed between the groups across different attributes. The largest differences related to the outcome (weight re-gain) and cost attributes, resulting in WTP estimates that were statistically significantly different. The most experienced group was willing to pay £0.35 (95% CI: £0.28, £0.42) to avoid a percentage point increase in weight re-gain, compared with £0.12 (95% CI: £0.08, £0.16) for the least experienced group. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence in a public health setting to suggest that preferences differ based on respondent experience of the health issue and its treatment. Health preference researchers should therefore carefully consider the appropriate composition of their study samples.",1
Effect of Utilizing Cheek Retractors on Patient Satisfaction and Trueness of Peripheral Borders in Maxillary Digital Scans for Totally Edentulous Patients: An In Vivo Study.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of cheek retractors on the accuracy of capturing peripheral borders in totally edentulous digital scans by comparing the conventional impression technique to digital scans made using two different cheek retractors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen edentulous maxillary impressions were made using three techniques: the conventional impression technique, using modeling thermoplastic compound and zinc oxide eugenol paste; the digital intraoral scanning technique using the DIO scan retractor (DIO); and using the Br.nemark lip retractor (BRAN). The control impressions of each patient were poured, scanned using a desktop scanner, then transferred into a three-dimensional analysis software. DIO and BRAN groups were scanned using an intraoral scanner, imported, and superimposed using best fit algorithm on the corresponding control. The root mean square for the whole surface and for particular interest regions were calculated to assess the degree of trueness. The patients' perceptions of the impression techniques were the secondary outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using the one sample T-test and Wilcoxon test (α=.05). RESULTS: Significant discrepancies were found for BRAN and DIO compared to the control. No significant discrepancies were found when comparing RMS of BRAN and DIO at different regions. Scan retractors had a significant impact on patient satisfaction, with patients preferring DIO. CONCLUSIONS: Edentulous intraoral scans made using cheek retractors had similar deviations when compared to each other but diverged from the conventional impression in edentulous maxilla. Patient preferences for intraoral scans over conventional impressions were confirmed. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The use of different retracting methods during intraoral scanning of totally edentulous maxillary arches does not affect the peripheral border registration.",0
Young persons and healthcare professionals experience of virtual gastroenterology consultations: a multicentre survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore Young Persons (YP) and healthcare professionals (HCP) experiences of virtual consultations (VC) and establish whether developmentally appropriate healthcare can be delivered virtually. METHOD: YP and HCP questionnaire surveys were designed and piloted. Electronic questionnaire links were sent by post, email or text message January-April 2021 to YP aged 13-25 years old, with predefined chronic gastrointestinal conditions, attending a gastroenterology/hepatology VC. HCP undertaking VC were invited to complete staff questionnaire. Results were anonymous and collated using Excel version 2302. RESULTS: Five UK hospital trusts participated, with 35 HCP responses. Of the 100 YP completing the survey 66% were female and 34% male aged between 13 years and 25 years (median: 18 years). 13% were new appointments and 87% follow ups, 29% were by video, 69% by phone and 2% gave no response. 80% of HCP spoke to YP directly but not privately (69%). 87% of YP and 88% HCP found VC useful. 83% of YP want VC again, although 20% preferred face to face. 43% of HCP required improved phone/internet connection. 77% of YP required hospital appointments for tests following VC. CONCLUSIONS: Overall respondents were satisfied with VC, finding them useful, convenient and time saving. Successful VC rely on appropriate patient selection and availability of reliable technology. Patient preference is key which may alter with time.",0
Acromegaly: Pathophysiological Considerations and Treatment Options Including the Evolving Role of Oral Somatostatin Analogs.,"Acromegaly is a condition most commonly diagnosed in the fifth decade of life and has numerous treatment options. In this regard, Mycapssa(®) is the first FDA-approved oral octreotide capsule for treating acromegaly, combining the efficacy of the somatostatin receptor ligand, octreotide, with the ease of a twice-daily oral capsule. Where surgical treatment is not an option, somatostatin analogs, including octreotide, are the first line of medical treatment for acromegaly, requiring regular subcutaneous or intramuscular injections administered by a patient's healthcare provider. Octreotide capsules (Mycapssa(®)) provide an alternative to these somatostatin receptor ligand injections by combining octreotide with other excipients to produce a transient permeability enhancer technology that improves paracellular transport of octreotide across the gastrointestinal wall into the small intestine. Across multiple trials, including open-label (CH-ACM-01), double-blind placebo-controlled (CHIASMA OPTIMAL), and open-label extension of the trial period (CHIASMA OPTIMAL OLE), Mycapssa(®) octreotide capsules maintained a consistent biochemical normalization of IGF-1 and GH levels, safety profiles similar to injected somatostatin receptor ligands, and patient preference to continued treatment with octreotide capsules. While clinical trial data supports the use of octreotide capsules (Mycapssa(®)) in the pharmacological management of GH and IGF-1 levels, very little data exist regarding the drug's efficacy, tolerability, and use in female or pediatric-specific populations. A better understanding of the efficacy, application, and role of oral octreotide capsules in the long-term medical management of acromegaly in a diversity of populations is imperative to best determine the risks/benefits for the clinician.",0
A meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis comparing nonoperative versus operative management for uncomplicated appendicitis: a focus on randomized controlled trials.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to provide a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing conservative and surgical treatment in a population of adults with uncomplicated acute appendicitis. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL. We have exclusively incorporated randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies involving participants with complicated appendicitis or children were excluded. The variables considered are as follows: treatment complications, complication-free treatment success at index admission and at 1 year follow-up, length of hospital stay (LOS), quality of life (QoL) and costs. RESULTS: Eight RCTs involving 3213 participants (1615 antibiotics/1598 appendectomy) were included. There was no significant difference between the two treatments in terms of complication rates (RR = 0.66; 95% CI 0.61-1.04, P = 0.07, I(2) = 69%). Antibiotics had a reduced treatment efficacy compared with appendectomy (RR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.71 to 0.90, p < 0.00001, I(2) = 87%) and at 1 year was successful in 540 out of 837 (64.6%, RR = 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.77, p < 0.00001, I(2) = 81%) participants. There was no difference in LOS (mean difference - 0.58 days 95% confidence interval - 1.59 to 0.43, p = 0.26, I(2) = 99%). The trial sequential analysis has revealed that, concerning the three primary outcomes, it is improbable that forthcoming RCTs will significantly alter the existing body of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: As further large-scale trials have been conducted, antibiotic therapy proved to be safe, less expensive, but also less effective than surgical treatment. In order to ensure well-informed decisions, further research is needed to explore patient preferences and quality of life outcomes.",0
Frequency and clinical outcomes of pharmacist-driven switching from warfarin to direct oral anticoagulants in an underserved patient population: A retrospective cohort study.,"PURPOSE: Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) medications have improved safety, efficacy, and laboratory monitoring requirements compared to warfarin. However, available data are limited on the frequency and clinical outcomes of pharmacist-driven warfarin-to-DOAC switches. We aimed to quantify the frequencies and rationale of warfarin-to-DOAC switches in an underserved population. We also assessed clinical outcomes and compliance with recommended laboratory monitoring after switches. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult (age 18 years or older) patients on warfarin who were assessed by a clinical pharmacist for switch appropriateness to a DOAC. Study data were collected via manual chart review and included demographics, comorbid illnesses, switch status, the rationale for or against switching, incidence of thromboses and bleeds within 6 months of the switch assessment, and the time to the first complete blood count and renal and hepatic function tests after the switch. Statistical analysis utilized descriptive statistics, including the mean and SD, median and interquartile range, and frequencies and percentages. RESULTS: Among 189 eligible patients, 108 (57%) were switched from warfarin to a DOAC. The primary rationales for switching were less monitoring (64%) and labile international normalized ratio (32%). The main reason against switching was DOAC inappropriateness (53%), such as in morbid obesity (14%). Patient preference was commonly cited in both groups (54% and 36%, respectively). The overall incidence of thrombotic events (9%) and bleeds (15%) after switch assessment was low. Laboratory monitoring after switches was consistent with current recommendations. CONCLUSION: No increase in harm was observed 6 months after switch assessment when pharmacists at a family medicine clinic switched underserved patients from warfarin to DOACs.",0
Patient preferences of patient selection criteria for upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation: A qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation is a life-enhancing reconstructive treatment option that aims to improve recipients' quality of life and maximize function. This study assessed upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation patient selection criteria perceptions among individuals with upper extremity limb loss. The perceptions of individuals with upper extremity limb loss on patient selection criteria may enable vascularized composite allotransplantation centers to improve criteria to avoid mismatched expectations about the posttransplant vascularized composite allotransplantation experience and outcomes. Realistic patient expectations may increase patient adherence, improve outcomes, and reduce vascularized composite allotransplantation graft loss. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with civilian and military service members with upper extremity limb loss and upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation candidates, participants, and recipients from three US institutions. Interviews assessed perceptions of patient selection criteria for suitability as a candidate for upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation. Thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. RESULTS: A total of 50 individuals participated (66% participation rate). Most participants were male (78%), White (72%), with a unilateral limb loss (84%), and a mean age of 45 years. Six themes emerged regarding upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation patient selection criteria, including support for candidates who: (1) are of younger age, (2) are in good physical health, (3) have mental stability, (4) are willing to ""put in the work,"" (5) have specific amputation characteristics, and (6) have sufficient social support. Patients had preferences about selecting candidates with unilateral versus bilateral limb loss. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that numerous factors, including medical, social, and psychological characteristics, inform patients' perceptions of patient selection criteria for upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation. Patient perceptions of patient selection criteria should inform the development of validated screening measures that optimize patient outcomes.",0
Patient Engagement in and Adaptations to Delivery of Outpatient Care for Opioid Use Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated adaptations to outpatient care delivery and changes in treatment demand and engagement among patients receiving medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in the months after the declaration of the COVID-19 public health emergency in 2020. METHODS: Data were collected through an online survey (June-November 2020) of outpatient MOUD prescribers. The survey obtained information on outpatient practices' adaptations to MOUD treatment and urine drug screening (UDS) and elicited provider views on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient demand for, and engagement in, treatment. Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine associations among practice characteristics, patient engagement, and service adaptations. RESULTS: Of 516 respondents, 74% reported adaptations to MOUD delivery during the pandemic. Most respondents implemented virtual visits for initial (67%) and follow-up (77%) contacts. Prescribers of buprenorphine were more likely than those who did not prescribe the medication to report MOUD adaptations. Among respondents reporting any MOUD adaptation, 77% made adaptations to their UDS practices. Among 513 respondents who answered COVID-19-related questions, 89% reported that the pandemic had affected the treatment and engagement of their patients. Of these respondents, 30% reported increased difficulty with patient engagement, and 45% reported that their patients preferred virtual visits during this period, whereas 18% endorsed patient preference for in-person visits. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth and federal regulatory easements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic enabled providers to continue treating patients for opioid use disorder in 2020. The results suggest that care adaptations and changes in patient demand and engagement were common in the practices surveyed.",0
Comparison between two patient-reported outcome measures for patients with cervical radiculopathy: A think-aloud study.,"BACKGROUND: The Cervical Radiculopathy Impact Scale (CRIS) and Patient Specific Functional Scale 2.0 (PSFS 2.0) are patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) used to assess activity limitations in patients with cervical radiculopathy (CR). This study a) compared the CRIS subscale 3 and the PSFS 2.0 in patients with CR with respect to completeness and patient preference, b) established the correlation between both PROMs in assessing the individual patient's level of functional limitations and c) assessed the frequency of reported functional limitations. METHODS: Participants with CR participated in semi-structured, individual, face-to-face interviews as part of a ""think-aloud"" process; verbalising their thoughts while completing both PROMs. Sessions were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were recruited. The most frequently reported functional limitation on the CRIS was: 'working at a computer' (n = 17) and overhead activities' (n = 10) for the PSFS 2.0. There was significant moderate positive correlation between the scores on the PSFS 2.0 and the CRIS (Spearman's r = 0.55, n = 22 p = .008). Most patients (n = 18; 82%) preferred the ability to present their own individual functional limitations of the PSFS 2.0. Eleven participants (50%) preferred the 11-point scale of the PSFS 2.0 over the 5-point Likert scale scoring option of the CRIS. CONCLUSION: Both easy to complete PROMs capture functional limitations in patients with CR. Most patients prefer the PSFS 2.0 over the CRIS. The wording and layout of both PROMs need refinement to enhance user-friendliness and avoid misinterpretation.",0
Impact of advance care planning and end-of-life conversations on patients with cancer: An integrative review of literature.,"PURPOSE: The purpose was to review published articles to examine the impact of advance care planning (ACP) and end-of-life (EOL) conversations on patients with cancer, and aimed to compare the findings for congruency with the goals of ACP. DESIGN AND METHOD: The study was guided by Whittemore and Knafl's integrative review methodology. Articles published between 2015 to 2020 were identified through electronic databases. The search included: Cumulative Index for Nursing Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, MEDLINE-Ovid, and MEDLINE full text, and using the MeSH terms. Two hundred and five (205) articles were identified and screened for eligibility, and 15 articles were appraised. FINDINGS: The fifteen (15) articles that met the inclusion criteria included five (5) qualitative, eight (8) quantitative, and two (2) mixed methods. The review analysis revealed six themes emerged in three categories: cancer patients' experience with advance care planning (1) patients' prognostic awareness, (2) decision making; cancer patients' perceived outcomes with advance care planning (3) patient-provider relationship, (4) concordance in care based on goals, and cancer patients' propositions related to advance care planning, (5) timings of advance care planning discussions, and (6) support during ACP and/or EOL conversations. CONCLUSION: ACP and EOL conversations play a critical role in cancer patients' awareness of their disease and prognosis and help them in making end-of-life care decisions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There exists a need for earlier ACP and EOL conversations with cancer patients with emotional support during these conversations.",0
Stroke survivors' preferences for post-stroke self-management programs: A discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Self-management programs enhance survival in stroke patients. However, they require patient-centered designs to be effective. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the type of post-stroke self-management programs that appeal to stroke survivors, and to estimate their willingness to participate in such programs. METHODS: A Discrete Choice Experiment was administered to patients who had either a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke within the past 3 years and were cognitively intact (i.e., stroke survivors). Stroke survivors were presented with eight choice tasks and asked to choose between 'No Program' and two hypothetical post-stroke management programs that varied by six attributes: Topics covered by the program; schedule of the program; frequency and duration of the sessions; number of participants; out-of-pocket registration fee for the whole program; and rewards for completing the program. RESULTS: The analysis involved 146 stroke survivors. Based on the mixed logit model, the predicted willingness to participate ranged from 53% to 76%. The most popular characteristics in a program were topics on health education and risk management, being scheduled during weekends as four sessions that are each 2 hours long and involve four participants, a registration fee of SGD50 (∼USD36), and SGD500 (∼USD359) reward for program completion. CONCLUSIONS: Interest in post-stroke self-management programs was high, with at least half of the sample showing interest in participating in these programs. Program features such as focusing on health education and risk management, charging a low registration fee, and offering incentives helped to increase the demand.",1
Conventional standard-sized bra with prosthesis or patient's bra with customized hand-knitted external prosthesis after mastectomy: Mixed-methods evaluation of patients' preferences.,"INTRODUCTION: In breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy without reconstruction, an external breast prosthesis could aid patients' recovery, improve body image and confidence by helping to regain a symmetrical chest appearance when dressed. However, external breast prosthesis preferences among Asian breast cancer patients were not widely studied. We aimed to compare patients' experience with the conventional commercially manufactured standard-sized (small, medium, large, extra-large) bra and prosthesis versus customized hand-knitted external breast prosthesis with patient's bra after unilateral mastectomy at a tertiary hospital. This is the first such study in Asian women, to our knowledge. METHODS: In this prospective study, participants used the conventional bra-prosthesis followed by the customized one consecutively, each for at least 3 months before they were administered an identical questionnaire at 3 and 6 months respectively. The questionnaire assessed the patients' experience with the prosthesis on the aspects of comfort, body image and satisfaction etc. Patients were also invited for in-depth interviews. RESULTS: Of 155 eligible patients, 148 patients participated with a response rate of 95.5%. 99 (67%) participants preferred the customized prosthesis, while 38 (25.7%) did not. 11 (7.4%) participants were undecided. Seventeen participants underwent in-depth interviews until data saturation on major qualitative themes was achieved. More patients experienced excessive sweating (p < 0.0001), greater discomfort (p = 0.0195) and higher rates of prosthesis dislodgement (p = 0.0269) with the conventional bra-prosthesis. CONCLUSION: Customized external breast prostheses could be an alternative to the conventional ones for breast cancer patients with mastectomy, with additional benefits of less sweating, more comfort and less dislodgement perceived.",0
Women's preference for a vaginal birth in Brazilian private hospitals: effects of a quality improvement project.,"BACKGROUND: In 2015, a quality improvement project called ""Adequate Childbirth Project"" (PPA) was implemented in Brazilian private hospitals in order to reduce cesarean sections without clinical indication. The PPA is structured in four components, one of which is directed at women and families. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of PPA on women's preference for vaginal birth (VB) at the end of pregnancy. METHODS: Evaluative research conducted in 12 private hospitals participating in the PPA. Interviews were carried out in the immediate postpartum period and medical record data were collected at hospital discharge. The implementation of PPA activities and women's preference for type of birth at the beginning and end of pregnancy were compared in women assisted in the PPA model of care and in the standard of care model, using a chi-square statistical test. To estimate the effect of PPA on women's preference for VB at the end of pregnancy, multiple logistic regression was performed with selection of variables using a causal diagram. RESULTS: Four thousand seven hundred ninety-eight women were interviewed. The implementation of the planned activities of PPA was less than 50%, but were significantly more frequent among women assisted in the PPA model of care. Women in this group also showed a greater preference for VB at the beginning and end of pregnancy. The PPA showed an association with greater preference for VB at the end of pregnancy in primiparous (OR 2.54 95% CI 1.99-3.24) and multiparous women (OR 1.44 95% CI 0.97-2.12), although in multiparous this association was not significant. The main factor associated with the preference for VB at the end of pregnancy was the preference for this type of birth at the beginning of pregnancy, both in primiparous (OR 18.67 95% CI 14.22-24.50) and in multiparous women (OR 53.11 95% CI 37.31-75.60). CONCLUSIONS: The PPA had a positive effect on women's preference for VB at the end of pregnancy. It is plausible that more intense effects are observed with the expansion of the implementation of the planned activities. Special attention should be given to information on the benefits of VB in early pregnancy.",0
Total Neoadjuvant Therapy (TNT) with Full Dose Concurrent Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Adenocarcinoma Including Signet Ring and Mucinous Cancers.,"PURPOSE: Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) with pre-operative chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy results in improved survival and is becoming the new standard of care in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). We describe our experience with TNT consisting of induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy using full dose 5FU without oxaliplatin. METHODS: Adults with biopsy-proven, newly diagnosed LARC with high-risk characteristics on pelvic MRI (T4a or T4b, extramural vascular invasion, N2, mesorectal fascia involvement, enlargement/tumor deposits on lateral lymph nodes) were included. The TNT protocol comprised of six biweekly courses of modified FOLFOX6 followed by pelvic RT with four concurrent cycles of biweekly 5-FU 2600 mg/m2 + LV 200 mg/m2 without oxaliplatin to complete 20 uninterrupted weeks of full dose 5FU. Surgery was planned 11-13 weeks after completing chemoradiotherapy. RESULTS: Eighty-four LARC patients, including 26% with signet-ring cell carcinoma, with high-risk MRI characteristics were treated with the TNT protocol with a 96% completion rate. Significant (> grade 3) toxicities included neutropenia (23.8%), diarrhea (14.2%) anemia (10.7%), and two deaths. The median DFS at 2 years was 22.5 months with better survival noted for those who underwent surgery or had cCR (with NOM) compared to those who did not undergo surgery (due to progression, inadequate regression, or patient preference despite residual disease) -mDFS 27.7 months versus 11.4 months, p =  < 0.0001 and mOS 29.2 months versus 15 months p =  < 0.0001. CONCLUSION: The hybrid TNT regimen was administered without significant dose delays or interruptions. Toxicity was manageable but with two treatment-related deaths. Ability to undergo surgery after TNT predicted for improved DFS and OS.",0
Outcome measures for young people with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: A qualitative exploration of healthcare professionals' perceptions and practices.,"BACKGROUND: Limited knowledge exists on current use of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) and performance measures for adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), as well as health care professionals' (HCPs) perceived barriers and facilitators towards their use. This study's objectives were: 1) to explore current practice of HCPs when assessing outcomes for AIS 2) to understand perceived barriers and facilitators of HCPs to use PROMs 3) to understand perceived barriers and facilitators of HCPs to use performance measures. METHODS: A qualitative study recruited a purposive sample of HCPs from a tertiary hospital in the United Kingdom. Mean years of experience managing individuals with AIS was 11.8 years; and included surgeons, physiotherapists and nurses, educated at Bachelor, Masters and Doctoral level. Consent to participate and demographic information were collected in advance of the interviews. In-depth, virtual semi-structured interviews were informed by a topic guide based on current evidence. Interviews of approximately 45 minutes were audio and video recorded and transcribed verbatim alongside written field notes. Data were coded and analysed using inductive thematic analysis, involving researchers with topic and methodological expertise and input from a patient representative. RESULTS: Two themes emerged regarding current practice of using PROMs routine practice and personal evaluations. Four themes emerged as barriers to using PROMs for individuals with AIS: priority and support (e.g., HCPs focus on providing care), practical challenges (e.g., inadequate PROMs), patient-related challenges (e.g., patient preferences) and knowledge, education, and perceived value. Two themes emerged as facilitators: quality existing measure (e.g., sufficient psychometric properties), and priority and support (e.g., research department/culture). Themes for barriers to use performance measures were practicality (e.g., need physical space) and perceived value and knowledge (e.g., PROMs are more important), while the one theme for facilitators was practical consideration (e.g., acceptability). CONCLUSIONS: Although HCPs perceived the value of using outcome measures, current practice indicates limited use for individuals with AIS. The findings revealed different barriers and facilitators to implement PROMs in practice. Adopting performance measure are limited due to lack of knowledge and perceived value alongside the practicality, while considering practical factors can improve the use of these measures in practice.",0

Perspectives of Patients and Professionals on Patient Education in Complex Endovascular Aortic Repair.,"BACKGROUND: Misinterpretation of patient preferences in perioperative education can lead to an undesired treatment decision. This explorative interview study presents differences in perspectives of patients and professionals on patient education in complex endovascular aortic aneurysm management. METHODS: Using convenience sampling, a cross-sectional interview study was performed among patients who were in various stages of the decision-making process for complex endovascular aortic repair. Five physicians were interviewed, representing the main providers of clinical information. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed inductively. RESULTS: Twelve patients (mean age 76.6 [standard deviation: 6.4], 83% male) were interviewed. Ten (83%) felt like they had no other realistic option besides undergoing surgery, whereas all professionals (5/5) stressed the importance of delicate patient selection. Five patients out of 10 (50%) who commented on their preferred decisional role considered the professional's advice as decisive. All but 1 patient (11/12) reported that the information was easy to understand, whereas 4 out of 5 professionals (80%) doubted whether patients could fully comprehend everything. Patients experienced a lack of information on the recovery process, although professionals stated that this was addressed during consultation. CONCLUSIONS: Several differences were found in the perspectives of patients and professionals on education in complex aortic aneurysm management. In order to optimize patient involvement in decision-making, professionals should be aware of these possible discrepancies and address them during consultation. Future research could focus on these differences in more detail by including more patients depending on their treatment and decision stages.",0
"""A disembodied voice over the telephone"": a qualitative study of healthcare practitioners' experiences in geriatric medicine.","OBJECTIVES: This study explored the experience of delivering care remotely among practitioners in a UK geriatric medicine clinic. METHODS: Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with consultants (n = 5), nurses (n = 2), a speech and language and an occupational therapist, and thematically analysed. RESULTS: Four themes developed; Challenges of remote consultations; Perceived advantages of remote consultations; Disruption of involvement of family members; Impact on care staff. Participants felt that rapport and trust had been more feasible to develop remotely than they had anticipated, although this was more challenging for new patients and those with cognitive or sensory impairments. While practitioners identified advantages of remote consultations, including involving relatives, saving time, and reducing anxiety, they also experienced disadvantages such as consultations feeling like a 'production line', missing visual cues and reduced privacy. Some participants felt their professional identity was threatened by the lack of face-to-face contact, linked to feeling that remote consultations are not suitable for frail older adults or those with cognitive deficits. DISCUSSION: Staff perceived barriers to remote consultations that went beyond practical concerns, and suggest support for building rapport, involving families, and protecting clinician identity and job satisfaction may be warranted.",0
Patient Preferences of Breast Radiologists' Attire and Appearance.,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To assess patient preferences for breast radiologists' attire and appearance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multi-institutional anonymous, voluntary 19-question survey was administered to patients undergoing screening and diagnostic mammography examinations over a 5-week period. Using a 5-point Likert scale, respondents were asked about their preferences for gender-neutral attire (white coat), male-presenting attire (scrubs, dress shirt with tie, or dress shirt without tie), and female-presenting attire (scrubs, dress, blouse with pants, and blouse with skirt). Patient responses were compared to demographic data using bivariable analysis and multivariable regression. RESULTS: Response rate was 84.7% (957/1130). Mean respondent age was 57.2 years±11.9. Most respondents agreed/strongly agreed that the breast radiologist's appearance mattered (52.5%, 502/956) followed by being indifferent (28.1%, 269/956). Respondents with greater education levels felt less strongly (p=0.001) about the radiologist's appearance: 63.3% (70/110) less than college cared about appearance compared to 53.5% (266/497) college/vocational and 47.4% (165/348) graduate. Most respondents felt indifferent about a breast radiologist wearing a white coat (68.9%, 657/954) or about male-presenting breast radiologists wearing a tie (77.1%, 734/952) without significant demographic differences. Almost all respondents either prefer/strongly prefer (60.1%, 572/951) or were indifferent (39.6%, 377/951) to all breast radiologists wearing scrubs when performing procedures. While respondents approved of all attire choices overall, most respondents preferred scrubs for both male- and female-presenting breast radiologists (64.0%, 612/957 and 64.9%, 621/957, respectively). CONCLUSION: A variety of breast radiologists' attire can be worn while maintaining provider professionalism and without compromising patient expectations.",0
Preferred Conversation Topics with Respect to Treatment Decisions Among Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.,"PURPOSE: Greater knowledge of individuals' needs and preferences can enhance shared decision-making, which is associated with improved quality of decisions and increased satisfaction. This study aimed to identify and prioritize the attributes (ie conversation topics) that individuals with type 2 diabetes find it most important to discuss with their healthcare provider regarding treatment decisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: First, small group interviews were organized with adults with type 2 diabetes (N=8) treated in primary care to identify the attributes that they find important to discuss regarding treatment decisions. A five-step nominal group technique was applied during the interviews. An object best-worst scaling (BWS) survey was subsequently distributed to individuals with self-reported diabetes participating in the Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel of the Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (N=600) to determine the relative importance score (RIS) of the identified attributes. A higher RIS indicates a higher level of perceived importance. Subgroup and latent class analyses were performed to explore whether individuals' demographic and disease characteristics influenced their attribute preferences. RESULTS: A total of 21 attributes were identified during three small group interviews with individuals with type 2 diabetes. Respondents in the BWS survey (N=285) viewed ""quality of life"" (RIS=11.97), ""clinical outcomes"" (RIS=10.40), ""long-term diabetes complications"" (RIS=9.83) and ""short-term adverse medication"" (RIS=7.72) as the most important in the decision-making process for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Some differences in attribute preferences were identified according to demographic and disease characteristics. CONCLUSION: In general, individuals with type 2 diabetes not only want to discuss the biological effects of treatments, but also the impact of treatment on their quality of life. Healthcare providers should be aware that attributes are viewed differently by different individuals. This emphasizes the need for tailor-made healthcare decisions, which means eliciting and responding to individual preferences in the decision-making process.",1
"Family Members' Engagement in Symptom Communication, Assessment, and Management in the Intensive Care Unit: A Qualitative Study.","BACKGROUND: Opportunities for communication and participation in decision making are limited for critically ill patients, but family members serving as surrogates enable empowerment of these patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore family members' engagement in symptom communication in the intensive care unit. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive design using fieldwork methodology with triangulation of participant observation and individual interviews was conducted. Nine mechanically ventilated patients were observed in interaction with family members and clinicians in the intensive care unit. Six of the observed patients, 6 family members, and 9 clinicians were interviewed after participant observation. Field notes and transcripts were analyzed using Braun and Clarke's method of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Family members engaged actively in symptom communication, assessment, and management, and there were barriers and facilitators to family engagement. Three main themes and 9 subthemes describing family engagement emerged: (1) intermediary role (recognize and report symptoms, provide patient information, and assist in communication), (2) independent role (provide familiarity, manage symptoms, and promote patient communication), and (3) conditions for family engagement (intensive care unit environment, relationship with the patient, and patient preferences). DISCUSSION: Family members have unique knowledge of the patient that differs from and complement the competence of the staff, and might contribute to improved symptom communication. Future research should examine how family members can contribute to symptom communication, assessment, and management.",0
ACTivity as medicine In Oncology for Head and Neck (ACTIOHN): Protocol for a feasibility study investigating a patient-centred approach to exercise for people with head and neck cancer.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Attempts at personalisation of exercise programmes in head and neck cancer (HaNC) have been limited. The main aim of the present study is to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of introducing a remotely delivered, fully personalised, collaborative, and flexible approach to prescribing and delivering exercise programmes into the HaNC usual care pathway. METHODS: This is a single arm, feasibility study. Seventy patients diagnosed with HaNC will be recruited from two regional HaNC centres in the United Kingdom. Patients will undertake an 8-week exercise programme designed and delivered by cancer exercise specialists. The exercise programme will start any time between the time of diagnosis and up to 8 weeks after completing treatment, depending on patient preference. The content of the exercise programme will be primarily based on patient needs, preferences, and goals, but guided by current physical activity guidelines for people with cancer. The primary outcome measure is retention to the study. Secondary quantitative outcomes are uptake to the exercise programme, different measures of exercise adherence, pre- and post-intervention assessments of fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form), quality of life (SF-36), physical activity levels (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form), and various components of physical fitness. The outcomes of the nested qualitative study are acceptability and feasibility of the intervention evaluated via interviews with patients, health care professionals, and the cancer exercise specialists. Intervention and participant fidelity will be determined using checklists and scrutiny of each patient's logbook and the cancer exercise specialists' meeting notes. Analysis of quantitative data will be via standard summary statistics. Qualitative data will be analysed using thematic analysis. EXPECTED RESULTS: This feasibility study will inform the design and conduct of a future randomised controlled trial. Success will be defined according to a traffic light system for identifying the appropriateness of progression to a randomised controlled trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION: International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry (ISRCTN82505455).",0
A Discrete Choice Analysis Comparing COVID-19 Vaccination Decisions for Children and Adults.,"IMPORTANCE: COVID-19 vaccination rates in the US remain below optimal levels. Patient preferences for different attributes of vaccine products and the vaccination experience can be important in determining vaccine uptake decisions. OBJECTIVE: To assess preferences for attributes of adult and pediatric COVID-19 vaccination among US adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An online survey of a national panel of 1040 US adults was conducted in May and June 2021. A discrete choice analysis was used to measure the relative value of each attribute in the decision to choose a COVID-19 vaccination option for adults or children. Six attributes were used to described hypothetical vaccination options: vaccine effectiveness, mild side effects, rare adverse events, number of doses, time required for vaccination, and regulatory approval. Respondents chose between hypothetical vaccination profiles or no vaccination. Additional survey questions asked about vaccination beliefs, COVID-19 illness experience, COVID-19 risk factors, vaccination status, and opinions about the risk of COVID-19. EXPOSURES: Respondents chose which vaccine profile they would prefer to receive for themselves (or no vaccination). Respondents then considered an identical set of profiles for a hypothetical child aged 0 to 17 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Relative value of vaccination-related attributes were estimated using Bayesian logit regression. Preference profiles for subgroups were estimated using latent class analyses. RESULTS: A total of 1040 adults (610 [59%] female; 379 participants [36%] with an age of 55 years and older years) responded to the survey. When asked about vaccination choices for themselves, participants indicated that vaccine effectiveness (95% vs 60%) was a significant attribute (β, 9.59 [95% CrI, 9.20-10.00] vs β, 0.41 [95% CrI, 0-0.80]). Respondents also preferred fewer rare adverse events (β, 6.35 [95% CrI, 5.74-6.86), fewer mild side effects (β, 5.49; 95% CrI, 5.12-5.87), 1 dose (β, 5.41; 95% CrI, 5.04-5.78), FDA approval (β, 6.01; 95% CrI, 5.64-6.41), and shorter waiting times (β, 5.67; 95% CrI, 4.87-6.48). Results were very similar when framing the question as adult or child vaccination, with slightly stronger preference for fewer rare adverse events for children. Latent class analysis revealed 4 groups of respondents: (1) individuals sensitive to safety and regulatory status, (2) individuals sensitive to convenience, (3) individuals who carefully considered all attributes in making their choices, and (4) individuals who rejected the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of US adults, the identification of 4 distinct preference groups provides new information to guide communications to support vaccine decision making. In particular, the group that prioritize convenience (less time required for vaccination and fewer doses) may present an opportunity to create actionable strategies to increase vaccination uptake for both adult and pediatric populations.",1

A multi- and mixed-method adaptation study of a patient-centered perioperative mental health intervention bundle.,"BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression are common among older adults and can intensify during perioperative periods, but few mental health interventions are designed for older surgical patients' unique needs. As part of the feasibility trial, we developed and adapted a perioperative mental health (PMH) bundle for older patients comprised of behavioral activation (BA) and medication optimization (MO) to ameliorate anxiety and depressive symptoms before, during, and after cardiac, orthopedic, and oncologic surgery. METHODS: We used mixed-methods including workshop studios with patients, caregivers, clinicians, researchers, and interventionists; intervention refinement and reflection meetings; patient case review meetings; intervention session audio-recordings and documentation forms; and patient and caregiver semi-structured interviews. We used the results to refine our PMH bundle. We used multiple analytical approaches to report the nature of adaptations, including hybrid thematic analysis and content analysis informed by the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications - Expanded. RESULTS: Adaptations were categorized by content (intervention components), context (how the intervention is delivered, based on the study, target population, intervention format, intervention delivery mode, study setting, study personnel), training, and evaluation. Of 51 adaptations, 43.1% involved content, 41.2% involved context, and 15.7% involved training and evaluation. Several key adaptations were noted: (1) Intervention content was tailored to patient preferences and needs (e.g., rewording elements to prevent stigmatization of mental health needs; adjusting BA techniques and documentation forms to improve patient buy-in and motivation). (2) Cohort-specific adaptations were recommended based on differing patient needs. (3) Compassion was identified by patients as the most important element. CONCLUSIONS: We identified evidence-based mental health intervention components from other settings and adapted them to the perioperative setting for older adults. Informed by mixed-methods, we created an innovative and pragmatic patient-centered intervention bundle that is acceptable, feasible, and responsive to the needs of older surgical populations. This approach allowed us to identify implementation strategies to improve the reach, scalability, and sustainability of our bundle, and can guide future patient-centered intervention adaptations.

Out-of-Pocket Cost Modeling of Adjuvant Radiation Therapy Duration in Standard-of-Care Early Stage Breast Cancer Treatment Across Medicaid and Medicare Plans.,"PURPOSE: For early stage breast cancer (BC), the choice of radiation therapy duration (1 vs 3 weeks) is highly debated. Cost and financial toxicity are major concerns that patients with BC face. Nonetheless, there remain limited discussions providing granular details of the role of insurance in the aggregate cost of 1 week versus 3 weeks of radiation therapy for patients. This project aims to disaggregate costs by plan to increase transparency of out-of-pocket (OOP) cost estimates in radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Treatment procedures were determined through the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. OOP treatment costs, deductibles, and copays/coinsurance were calculated by using Medicaid, Original Medicare, Medigap Plan G, and Medicare Part D prescription plans. The medicare.gov, medicaid.oh.gov, aarpmedicareplans.com, and the physician fee schedule from cms.gov were used to determine costs by treatment. Price estimates reflect actual costs per insurance plan rather than costs estimated from claims data. All procedures were considered to be performed in an Ohio hospital setting. One-week radiation therapy was defined as 5 fractions without boost, and 3-week radiation therapy was defined as 15 fractions without boost. RESULTS: Medicare beneficiaries with Original Medicare coverage face an OOP treatment charge of $649.24 for 1 week of radiation therapy and $1006.20 for 3 weeks of radiation therapy. Assuming the deductible is met postlumpectomy, Medigap Plan G beneficiaries are faced with no additional charges for both lengths of radiation therapy. Similarly for Medicaid beneficiaries (assuming treatment is approved by Medicaid), all expenses are covered without limit, resulting in no OOP expense. CONCLUSIONS: Considerations of 1 and 3 weeks of radiation therapy for postlumpectomy early-stage BC are often dependent on cancer characteristics and patient preferences. This model (based on actual cost estimates per insurance plan rather than claims data) compares OOP costs across Medicaid and Medicare plans, which more holistically informs providers and patients in radiation therapy duration decision making.",0
"A ""Patient Preference"" Model of Recruitment for Research from Primary-Care-Based Memory Clinics: A Promising New Approach.","Recruiting persons with dementia for clinical trials can be challenging. Building on a guide initially developed to assist primary-care-based memory clinics in their efforts to support research, a key stakeholder working group meeting was held to develop a standardized research recruitment process, with input from patients, care partners, researchers, and clinicians. Discussions in this half-day facilitated meeting focused on the wishes and needs of patients and care partners, policy and procedures for researchers, information provided to patients, and considerations for memory clinics. Patients and care partners valued the opportunity to contribute to science and provided important insights on how to best facilitate recruitment. Discussions regarding proposed processes and procedures for research recruitment highlighted the need for a new, patient-driven approach. Accordingly, a key stakeholder co-designed ""Memory Clinic Research Match"" program was developed that has the potential to overcome existing barriers and to increase recruitment for dementia-related research.",0
Survey of lived experiences and challenges in hepatitis B management and treatment.,"Almost 300 million people are living with chronic hepatitis B infection worldwide and most remain undiagnosed and at risk for liver cancer. In 2015 the World Health Organization (WHO) developed guidelines for the prevention, care, and treatment of persons with chronic hepatitis B and in early 2023 began to work on updating these guidelines. In March 2023, a self-administered, anonymous online survey was launched, aiming to identify patient preferences related to the clinical management of hepatitis B including current management, treatment, and care experiences, preferences regarding engagement with providers, and preferences related to simplifying hepatitis B care access. A sample of 560 individuals living with hepatitis B (self-identified as HBsAg positive) from 76 countries completed the survey. Key findings demonstrated that less than half (49%, N = 268) of participants regularly visited a doctor to check the health of their liver (every 6-12 months), with 37% of participants prescribed antiviral medication by a specialist (82%, N = 167) or general practitioner (13%, N = 26). Participants reported not being actively involved in care decision making with their providers (42%, N = 217), with an overwhelming majority wanting to participate in hepatitis B management and treatment choices (85%, N = 435). Participants provided qualitative and quantitative details using open-ended responses within the survey about challenges with medication affordability and receiving care from a knowledgeable provider. Overall findings demonstrated key gaps in care, management, and treatment access related to hepatitis B: identifying these gaps can be used to identify areas for improvement along the care continuum for viral hepatitis. The survey found a need for the comprehensive simplification of clinical management and health care services related to hepatitis B. A thematic analysis of the open-ended survey responses highlighted major overarching themes including the cost and access burdens associated with hepatitis B management and treatment, and challenges in finding knowledgeable providers. Results from this mixed methods survey were used to inform the WHO hepatitis B guidelines update. Efforts should continue to explore public health approaches to address barriers and facilitators to testing, care, and treatment for people with hepatitis B to improve awareness of hepatitis B and access, care, and treatment among patients and providers.",0
"Clozapine once- versus multiple-daily dosing: a two-center cross-sectional study, systematic review and meta-analysis.","Evidence regarding effectiveness and safety of clozapine once- vs. multiple-daily dosing is limited. We compared demographic and clinical parameters between patients with once- vs. multiple-daily dosing in the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Regensburg, Germany (AGATE dataset), and the Department of Psychiatry, Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland, using non-parametric tests. Effectiveness and safety outcomes were available in the AGATE dataset. We performed a systematic review in PubMed/Embase until February 2022, meta-analyzing studies comparing clozapine once- vs. multiple-daily-dosing. We estimated a pooled odds ratio for adverse drug-induced reactions (ADRs) and meta-analyzed differences regarding clinical symptom severity, age, percentage males, smokers, clozapine dose, and co-medications between patients receiving once- vs. multiple-daily dosing. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa-Scale. Of 1494 and 174 patients included in AGATE and Lausanne datasets, clozapine was prescribed multiple-daily in 74.8% and 67.8%, respectively. In the AGATE cohort, no differences were reported for the clinical symptoms severity or ADR rate (p > 0.05). Meta-analyzing eight cohorts with a total of 2810 clozapine-treated individuals, we found more severe clinical symptoms (p = 0.036), increased ADR risk (p = 0.01), higher clozapine doses (p < 0.001), more frequent co-medication with other antipsychotics (p < 0.001), benzodiazepines (p < 0.001), anticholinergics (p = 0.039), and laxatives (p < 0.001) in patients on multiple- vs. once-daily dosing. Of six studies, five were rated as good, and one as poor quality. Patients responding less well to clozapine may be prescribed higher doses multiple-daily, also treated with polypharmacy, potentially underlying worse safety outcomes. Patient preferences and adherence should be considered during regimen selection.",0
Occlusal adjustment of 3-unit tooth-supported fixed dental prostheses fabricated with complete-digital and -analog workflows: A crossover clinical trial.,"AIM: This prospective crossover clinical trial aimed to compare the complete-digital and -analog workflows in terms of occlusal adjustment of 3-unit tooth-supported fixed dental prostheses, operator, and patient preferences. MATERIALS AND METHOD: This study included twelve patients receiving fourteen 3-unit posterior FDPs. 2 FDPs were made for each restoration site: one fabricated in complete-digital workflow comprising intraoral scan with static bite registration (Trios 3) and a monolithic zirconia FDP (test); the other fabricated in complete-analog workflow comprising conventional impression/face-bow transfer and a porcelain-fused-to-metal FDP (control). The FDPs (n=28) were intraorally/provisionally fixed, and quadrant-like intraoral scans were taken for every FDP before & after their occlusal adjustments. Pre- and post-adjustment scans of each FDP were then superimposed using best-fit alignment (GOM Inspect) to measure the volumetric occlusal adjustment amount (mm(3)) (3Matic) (Mann Whitney U, α=0.05). The patient and operator experience for digital and analog workflows were evaluated using visual analog scales (Wilcoxon test, α=0.05). RESULTS: Mean occlusal adjustments were 7.63 mm(3) [±7.02] and 25.95 mm(3) [±39.61] for test and control groups, respectively. The volumetric adjustment difference was clinically noticeable but not significant (P=0.12). The impression and digital workflow adjustment were perceived more favorably by both operator (P=0.003, P=0.046, respectively) and the patients (P=0.003, P=0.002, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this clinical study, the complete digital workflow with digital static bite-registration provided high occlusal accuracy for short-span tooth-supported FDPs. In addition, the patient and operator preferences significantly favored the digital workflow. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Complete-digital workflow employing intraoral scanning and model-free fabrication of monolithic-Zr short-span tooth-supported FDPs offers an effective treatment modality with sufficient occlusal accuracy. Therefore complete-digital workflow is a valid alternative for complete-analog workflow comprising conventional impression, face-bow transfer, and use of a semi-adjustable articulator.",0
Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy European Patient Survey: Assessing Patient Reported Disease Burden and Preferences in Clinical Trial Participation.,"BACKGROUND: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness leading to permanent disability. There are no curative treatments, however, there are several upcoming clinical trials testing new therapies in FSHD. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the disease burden and patient preferences of people with FSHD to ensure that clinical trials can be designed to include outcome measures that are relevant and important to patients. METHODS: A survey was developed with a steering committee clinicians and physiotherapists with relevant experience in the disease, patient representatives, a registry expert and industry consultants. Themes of the survey included; participant demographics, disease progression and impact on function, factors encouraging or discouraging clinical trial participation, and positive outcomes of a clinical trial. RESULTS: 1147 participants responded to the online survey, representing 26 countries across Europe and a range of disease severities. The study highlighted the key symptoms causing concern for FSHD patients - muscle weakness and mobility issues - reflecting what participants want targeted for future therapies. The need for clear information and communication throughout clinical trials was emphasised. Factors most encouraging trial participation included access to new investigational therapies, access to trial results and benefits for the FSHD community. Factors most discouraging trial participation included travel related issues and fear of side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study identify the patient reported burden of FSHD and should provide researchers and industry with areas of therapeutic research that would be meaningful to patients, as well as supporting the development of patient centric outcome measures in clinical trials.",0
Individual Patient Factors Associated with the Use of Physical or Digital Primary Care in Sweden.,"Introduction: Little is known about factors that influence patients' choice to use physical or digital primary care. This study aimed to compare self-rated health, internet habits, and what patients deem important when choosing health care between users of physical and digital primary health care. Methods: We recruited 2,716 adults visiting one of six physical or four digital primary health care providers in Stockholm, Sweden, October 2020 to May 2021. Participants answered a questionnaire with questions about sociodemography, self-rated health, internet habits, and what they considered important when seeking care. We used logistic regression and estimated odds ratios (ORs) for choosing digital care. Results: Digital users considered themselves healthier and used the internet more, compared with physical users (p < 0.001). Competence of health care staff was the most important factor when seeking care to both physical and digital users (90% and 78%, respectively). Patients considering it important to avoid leaving home were more likely to seek digital care (OR 29.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.65-69.06), while patients valuing continuity were more likely to seek physical care (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.19-0.32). These factors were significant also when adjusting for self-rated health and sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusion: What patients considered important when seeking health care was associated with what type of care they sought. Patient preferences should be considered when planning health care to optimize resource allocation.",0
Current evidence for dietary therapies in irritable bowel syndrome.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diet appears to trigger symptoms in the majority of individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and is associated with a reduced quality of life. There has been a recent focus on the role of dietary therapies to manage individuals with IBS. The aim of this review is to discuss the utility of traditional dietary advice (TDA), low-FODMAP diet (LFD) and gluten-free diet (GFD) in IBS. RECENT FINDINGS: Several recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published demonstrating the efficacy of the LFD and GFD in IBS, with the evidence base for TDA being predominantly based on clinical experience, with emerging RCTs evaluating TDA. Only one RCT has been published to date comparing TDA, LFD and GFD head to head, with no difference noted between diets in terms of efficacy. However, TDA has been noted to be more patient-friendly and is commonly implemented as a first-line dietary therapy. SUMMARY: Dietary therapies have been demonstrated to improve symptoms in patients with IBS. In view of insufficient evidence to recommend one diet over another currently, specialist dietetic input in conjunction with patient preference is required to determine implementation of dietary therapies. Novel methods of dietetic delivery are required in view of the lack of dietetic provision to deliver these therapies.",0
Assessment of patients' preferences for new anticancer drugs in China: a best-worst discrete choice experiment on three common cancer types.,"OBJECTIVES: Despite the advancement in anticancer drug therapies, cancer treatment decisions are often complex and preference-sensitive, making them well suited for studying shared decision-making (SDM). Our study aimed to assess preferences for new anticancer drugs among three common types of patients with cancer to inform SDM. DESIGN: We identified five attributes of new anticancer drugs and used a Bayesian-efficient design to generate choice sets for a best-worst discrete choice experiment (BWDCE). The mixed logit regression model was applied to estimate patient-reported preferences for each attribute. The interaction model was used to investigate preference heterogeneity. SETTING: The BWDCE was conducted in Jiangsu province and Hebei province in China. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18 years or older, who had a definite diagnosis of lung cancer, breast cancer or colorectal cancer were recruited. RESULTS: Data from 468 patients were available for analysis. On average, the most valued attribute was the improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (p<0.001). The low incidence of severe to life-threatening side effects, prolonged progression-free survival and the low incidence of mild to moderate side effects were also positive predictors of patients' preferences (p<0.001). Out-of-pocket cost was a negative predictor of their preferences (p<0.001). According to subgroup analysis by type of cancer, the improvement in HRQoL remained the most valuable attribute. However, the relative importance of other attributes varied by type of cancer. Whether patients were newly diagnosed or previously diagnosed cancer cases played a dominant role in the preference heterogeneity within each subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Our study can assist in the implementation of SDM by providing evidence on patients' preferences for new anticancer drugs. Patients should be informed of the multiattribute values of new drugs and encouraged to make decisions reflecting their values.",1
"Contracting retail pharmacies as a source of essential medicines for public sector clients in low- and middle-income countries: a scoping review of key considerations, challenges, and opportunities.","BACKGROUND: Insurances in high-income countries (HIC) often contract with private community pharmacies to dispense medicines to outpatients. In contrast, dispensing of medicines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) often lacks such contractual arrangements. Furthermore, many LMICs lack sufficient investment in supply chains and financial and human resources to guarantee stock levels and services at public medicine-dispensing institutions. Countries striving to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) can, in principle, incorporate retail pharmacies into their supply chains to expand access to essential medicines (EMs). The objectives of this paper are (a) to identify and analyze key considerations, opportunities and challenges for public payers when contracting out the supply and dispensing of medicines to retail pharmacies and (b) to provide examples of strategies and policies to address these challenges. METHODS: A targeted literature strategy was used to conduct this scoping review. We created an analytical framework of key dimensions: (1) governance (including medicine and pharmacy regulation); (2) contracting (3) reimbursement; (4) medicine affordability (5) equitable access; and (6) quality of care (including 'patient-centered' pharmaceutical care). Using this framework, we selected a mix of three HIC and four LMIC case studies and analyzed the opportunities and challenges encountered when contracting retail pharmacies. RESULTS: From this analysis, we identified a set of opportunities and challenges that should be considered by public payers considering public-private contracting: (1) balancing business viability with medicine affordability; (2) incentivizing equitable access to medicines; (3) ensuring quality of care and delivery of services; (4) ensuring product quality; (5) task-sharing from primary care providers to pharmacies and (6) securing human resources and related capacity constraints to ensure sustainability of the contract. CONCLUSION: Public-private partnerships offer opportunities to improve access to EMs. Nonetheless, managing these agreements is complex and is influenced by a variety of factors. For effective contractual partnerships, a systems approach is needed in which business, industry and regulatory contexts are considered in tandem with the health system. Special attention should be devoted to rapidly changing health contexts and systems, such as changes in patient preferences and market developments brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
Multivessel Disease.,"A coronary artery is a well-developed trilaminar structure. The innermost layer is termed the tunica intima, which is lined with endothelial cells that make contact with the circulating arterial blood. The endothelial cells have a tightly regulated vascular homeostasis mechanism, failure of which leads to atherosclerotic disease process. Multivessel disease is defined as significant stenosis (>70%) in two or more major coronary arteries of 2.5 mm diameter or more. About 40% to 50% of patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have multivessel coronary disease. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been primarily used for revascularization of complex coronary artery disease (CAD) since 1968. When percutaneous intervention (PCI) was introduced in 1977, it was initially considered a treatment option for patients with single-vessel disease. Advancements in cardiothoracic surgical techniques with the utilization of smaller incisions, arterial conduits, off-pump CABG, and improved postoperative care have led to a reduction in morbidity and mortality and is the preferred revascularization method for multivessel disease. Recent technological and technical advancement in PCI techniques has broadened the treatment scope to now include patients with multivessel disease. Regardless of which modality is chosen, an interprofessional approach should be undertaken and account for various factors, including patient preference, surgical risk, and operator skill.",0
Enteroscopy versus Video Capsule Endoscopy for Automatic Diagnosis of Small Bowel Disorders-A Comparative Analysis of Artificial Intelligence Applications.,"BACKGROUND: Small bowel disorders present a diagnostic challenge due to the limited accessibility of the small intestine. Accurate diagnosis is made with the aid of specific procedures, like capsule endoscopy or double-ballon enteroscopy, but they are not usually solicited and not widely accessible. This study aims to assess and compare the diagnostic effectiveness of enteroscopy and video capsule endoscopy (VCE) when combined with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for the automatic detection of small bowel diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an extensive literature search for relevant studies about AI applications capable of identifying small bowel disorders using enteroscopy and VCE, published between 2012 and 2023, employing PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Embase, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. RESULTS: Our investigation discovered a total of 27 publications, out of which 21 studies assessed the application of VCE, while the remaining 6 articles analyzed the enteroscopy procedure. The included studies portrayed that both investigations, enhanced by AI, exhibited a high level of diagnostic accuracy. Enteroscopy demonstrated superior diagnostic capability, providing precise identification of small bowel pathologies with the added advantage of enabling immediate therapeutic intervention. The choice between these modalities should be guided by clinical context, patient preference, and resource availability. Studies with larger sample sizes and prospective designs are warranted to validate these results and optimize the integration of AI in small bowel diagnostics. CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis demonstrates that both enteroscopy and VCE with AI augmentation exhibit comparable diagnostic performance for the automatic detection of small bowel disorders.",0
Knee Cartilage Lesion Management-Current Trends in Clinical Practice.,"Many patients, particularly those aged above 40, experience knee joint pain, which hampers both sports activities and daily living. Treating isolated chondral and osteochondral defects in the knee poses a significant clinical challenge, particularly in younger patients who are not typically recommended partial or total knee arthroplasty as alternatives. Several surgical approaches have been developed to address focal cartilage defects. The treatment strategies are characterized as palliation (e.g., chondroplasty and debridement), repair (e.g., drilling and microfracture), or restoration (e.g., autologous chondrocyte implantation, osteochondral autograft, and osteochondral allograft). This review offers an overview of the commonly employed clinical methods for treating articular cartilage defects, with a specific focus on the clinical trials conducted in the last decade. Our study reveals that, currently, no single technology fully meets the essential requirements for effective cartilage healing while remaining easily applicable during surgical procedures. Nevertheless, numerous methods are available, and the choice of treatment should consider factors such as the location and size of the cartilage lesion, patient preferences, and whether it is chondral or osteochondral in nature. Promising directions for the future include tissue engineering, stem cell therapies, and the development of pre-formed scaffolds from hyaline cartilage, offering hope for improved outcomes.",0
Outcomes of Laparoscopic Suture vs Mesh Rectopexy for Complete Rectal Prolapse.,"Objective To compare outcomes of laparoscopic suture and laparoscopic mesh rectopexy for the treatment of complete rectal prolapse in adults. Materials and methods This study was conducted between December 2020 to December 2022, involving 75 patients (Group A: 34; Group B: 41). Inclusion criteria encompassed confirmed complete rectal prolapse. Preoperative measures included comprehensive assessments, mechanical bowel cleansing, prophylactic antibiotics, and rectal irrigation. Surgical techniques involved laparoscopic suture rectopexy for Group A and laparoscopic mesh rectopexy for Group B. Postoperative care and follow-up evaluations were conducted. Results Group A demonstrated advantages in terms of shorter operative times, quicker bowel activity resumption, and reduced hospital stays. Intraoperative bleeding was absent in Group A, while wound-related complications were higher in Group B. Recurrence rates were lower in Group A (2.9%) compared to Group B (9.8%). Both groups exhibited improvements in incontinence grades postoperatively. Constipation increased in both groups. Conclusion Both techniques are effective in treating complete rectal prolapse, each with its advantages and considerations. Group A showed potential benefits in terms of operative efficiency and fewer complications, albeit with a potential for increased recurrence. The study emphasizes the need for individualized patient care, considering factors such as operative characteristics, postoperative outcomes, and patient preferences.",0
Patients' perspectives and preferences toward telemedicine versus in-person visits: a mixed-methods study on 1226 patients.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite the fact that telemedicine can eliminate geographical and time limitations and offer the possibility of diagnosing, treating, and preventing diseases by sharing reliable information, many individuals still prefer to visit medical centers for in-person consultations. The aim of this study was to determine the level of acceptance of telemedicine compared to in-person visits, identify the perceived advantages of telemedicine over in-person visits, and to explore the reasons why patients choose either of these two types of visits. METHODS: We developed a questionnaire using the rational method. The questionnaire consisted of multiple-choice questions and one open-ended question. A total of 2059 patients were invited to participate in the study. Chi-square tests and descriptive statistics were employed for data analysis. To analyze the data from the open-ended question, we conducted qualitative content analysis using MAXQDA 18. RESULTS: Out of the 1226 participants who completed the questionnaire, 865 (71%) preferred in-person visits, while 361 (29%) preferred telemedicine. Factors such as education level, specific health conditions, and prior experience with telemedicine influenced the preference for telemedicine. The participants provided a total of 183 different reasons for choosing either telemedicine (108 reasons) or in-person visits (75 reasons). Avoiding infectious diseases, saving cost, and eliminating and overcoming geographical distance barriers were three primary telemedicine benefits. The primary reasons for selecting an in-person visit were: more accurate diagnosis of the disease, more accurate and better examination of the patient by the physician, and more accurate and better treatment of the disease. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that despite the numerous benefits offered by telemedicine, the majority of patients still exhibit a preference for in-person visits. In order to promote broader acceptance of telemedicine, it becomes crucial for telemedicine services to address patient preferences and concerns effectively. Employing effective change management strategies can aid in overcoming resistance and facilitating the widespread adoption of telemedicine within the population.",0
Treatment preferences among Japanese patients and physicians for epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence is limited on preferences of Japanese patients and physicians in treatment for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several oral or intravenous novel agents for EGFR exon 20 insertions are under development. The aim of our study was to investigate which attributes of novel treatments influenced selection of oral or intravenous agents among treated patients and treating physicians in Japan. METHODS: The study was designed by board-certified oncologists, patient representatives, and analytics specialists. Eligible participants completed an online survey with a discrete choice experiment presenting two treatment profiles described by attributes: mode of administration (oral or intravenous); frequency of administration; overall response rate (ORR); average progression-free survival (PFS); chance of experiencing severe side effects (SEs); mild-moderate gastrointestinal SEs; mild-moderate skin-related SEs; and patient out-of-pocket costs. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (all self-reported EGFR-mutant) and 74 physicians participated from December 2021 to August 2022. All attributes being equal, there was greater preference for oral administration. However, there was greater preference for intravenous over oral, when ORR and PFS improved by 10% and 1 month, and severe SEs reduced by 10%. Physicians exhibited greater preference for PFS compared to patients (p < 0.01). Ranked order of attribute importance was as follows: (1) PFS; (2) ORR; (3) severe SEs, expressed by patients and physicians alike. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed Japanese physician and patient preferences in treatment options for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Compared to the strong preference for a more efficacious drug, the preference of oral versus intravenous revealed a smaller impact.",1
Driving factors in treatment decision-making of patients seeking medical assistance for infertility: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: ART differs in effectiveness, side-effects, administration, and costs. To improve the decision-making process, we need to understand what factors patients consider to be most important. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: We conducted this systematic review to assess which aspects of ART treatment (effectiveness, safety, burden, costs, patient-centeredness, and genetic parenthood) are most important in the decision-making of patients with an unfulfilled wish to have a child. SEARCH METHODS: We searched studies indexed in Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL prior to November 2023. Discrete choice experiments (DCEs), surveys, interviews, and conjoint analyses (CAs) about ART were included. Studies were included if they described two or more of the following attributes: effectiveness, safety, burden, costs, patient-centeredness, and genetic parenthood.Participants were men and women with an unfulfilled wish to have a child. From each DCE/CA study, we extracted the beta-coefficients and calculated the relative importance of treatment attributes or, in case of survey studies, extracted results. We assessed the risk of bias using the rating developed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group. Attributes were classified into effectiveness, safety, burden, costs, patient-centeredness, genetic parenthood, and others. OUTCOMES: The search identified 938 studies of which 20 were included: 13 DCEs, three survey studies, three interview studies, and one conjoint analysis, with a total of 12 452 patients. Per study, 47-100% of the participants were women. Studies were assessed as having moderate to high risk of bias (critical: six studies, serious: four studies, moderate: nine studies, low: one study). The main limitation was the heterogeneity in the questionnaires and methodology utilized. Studies varied in the number and types of assessed attributes. Patients' treatment decision-making was mostly driven by effectiveness, followed by safety, burden, costs, and patient-centeredness. Effectiveness was rated as the first or second most important factor in 10 of the 12 DCE studies (83%) and the relative importance of effectiveness varied between 17% and 63%, with a median of 34% (moderate certainty of evidence). Of eight studies evaluating safety, five studies valued safety as the first or second most important factor (63%), and the relative importance ranged from 8% to 35% (median 23%) (moderate certainty of evidence). Cost was rated as first or second most important in five of 10 studies, and the importance relative to the other attributes varied between 5% and 47% (median 23%) (moderate certainty of evidence). Burden was rated as first or second by three of 10 studies (30%) and the relative importance varied between 1% and 43% (median 13%) (low certainty of evidence). Patient-centeredness was second most important in one of five studies (20%) and had a relative importance between 7% and 24% (median 14%) (low certainty of evidence). Results suggest that patients are prepared to trade-off some effectiveness for more safety, or less burden and patient-centeredness. When safety was evaluated, the safety of the child was considered more important than the mother's safety. Greater burden (cycle cancellations, number of injections, number of hospital visits, time) was more likely to be accepted by patients if they gained effectiveness, safety, or lower costs. Concerning patient-centeredness, information provision and physician attitude were considered most important, followed by involvement in decision-making, and treatment continuity by the same medical professional. Non-genetic parenthood did not have a clear impact on decision-making. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The findings of this review can be used in future preference studies and can help healthcare professionals in guiding patients' decision-making and enable a more patient-centered approach.",1
Preferences of patients with diabetes mellitus for primary healthcare institutions: a discrete choice experiment in China.,"OBJECTIVES: To quantify the preference of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) for primary healthcare (PHC) institutions in China to redirect the patient flow and improve health outcomes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. Discrete choice experiment (DCE) surveys asked patients with DM to choose between hypothetical institutions that differed in the medical service capacity, out-of-pocket (OOP) medical costs per month, travel time, the attitude of medical staff and the availability of diabetes drugs. SETTING: Shandong province, China. PARTICIPANTS: The participants were 887 patients with DM from 36 urban communities and 36 rural villages in Shandong province. One participant did not provide any DCE answers and a further 57 patients failed the internal consistency test. 829 fully completed surveys were included in the final data analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A mixed logit model was used to calculate the willingness to pay and predict choice probabilities for PHC institution attributes. Preference heterogeneity was also investigated. RESULTS: All five attributes were associated with the preferences of patients with DM. The OOP medical costs and the medical service capacity were the most influential attributes. Improvements simultaneously in the attitude of medical staff, drug availability and travel time increased the likelihood of a patient's PHC institution choice. Preferences differed by region, annual household income and duration of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient preference data may help policymakers improve health services and increase acceptance of choosing PHC institutions. The OOP medical costs and medical service capacity should be regarded as a priority in decision-making.",1
[Integrative medicine: what's new in 2023].,"To illustrate the news of 2023 in integrative medicine, the authors summarized four particularly relevant studies. The first highlights one of the foundational principles of integrative medicine, describing the importance of respecting patient preference in the choice of a therapeutic approach, promoting their «empowerment». The second article proposes methodological recommendations to improve the scientific value of studies assessing the efficacy and mechanisms of non-pharmacological approaches. Finally, the last two articles are randomized studies designed to either demonstrate the feasibility and effect of hypnosis in geriatrics, or evaluate the efficacy of a several combined complementary approaches for cancer-related fatigue.",0
Spinal Versus General Anesthesia for Outpatient Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty in the Ambulatory Surgery Center: A Matched-Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: Spinal anesthesia is the predominant regimen in outpatient total joint arthroplasty (TJA), but induction often is unsuccessful, unobtainable, or against patient preference. We compared outcomes of same-day discharge (SDD) TJA with spinal versus general anesthesia in a free-standing ambulatory surgery center (ASC). METHODS: We took 105 general anesthesia TJA and one-to-one nearest-neighbor matched them to 105 spinal anesthesia TJA over 7 years at 1 ASC. The rate of successful SDD, minutes to discharge, postoperative pain and nausea, and 90-day complications were compared. Postanesthesia care unit outcomes were additionally stratified by spinal anesthetic (mepivacaine versus bupivacaine). RESULTS: All spinal anesthetic patients underwent SDD compared with 103 (98%) general anesthetic patients (P = .498). Mepivacaine spinal anesthesia patients spent the fewest minutes in postanesthesia care unit prior to discharge from the facility (206), followed by general anesthesia (227), and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia (291; P < .001). General anesthesia patients had the highest levels of pain at 1 hour (5.2 versus 1.5 versus 1.5) and 2 hours (3.2 versus 2.0 versus 1.3) postoperatively, and rates of nausea (48 versus 22 versus 28%) compared with mepivacaine and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia, respectively. The 90-day complications (6 versus 7), admissions (1 versus 3), and reoperations (5 versus 2) were similar among spinal and general anesthesia, respectively (P ≥ .445). CONCLUSIONS: Both spinal and general anesthesia led to reliable SDD with similar 90-day complication rates. General anesthesia facilitated faster discharge from the ASC compared with bupivacaine spinal anesthesia but led to higher levels of pain and incidence of nausea postoperatively. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3, Retrospective Cohort Comparison.",0
Associations between Present-on-Admission Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders and Short-Term Outcomes in Patients with Pneumonia.,"OBJECTIVES: Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders are used to express patient preferences for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This study examined whether early DNR orders are associated with differences in treatments and outcomes among patients hospitalized with pneumonia. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 768,015 adult patients hospitalized with pneumonia from 2010 to 2015 in 646 US hospitals. The exposure was DNR orders present on admission. Secondary analyses stratified patients by predicted in-hospital mortality. Main outcomes included in-hospital mortality, length of stay, cost, intensive care admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, noninvasive ventilation, vasopressors, and dialysis initiation. RESULTS: Of 768,015 patients, 94,155 (12.3%) had an early DNR order. Compared with those without, patients with DNR orders were older (mean age 80.1 ± 10.6 years vs 67.8 ± 16.4 years), with higher comorbidity burden, intensive care use (31.6% vs 30.6%), and in-hospital mortality (28.2% vs 8.5%). After adjustment via propensity score weighting, these patients had higher mortality (odds ratio [OR] 2.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.33-2.45) and lower use of intensive therapies such as vasopressors (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.81-0.85) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.66-0.70). Although there was little relationship between predicted mortality and DNR orders, among those with highest predicted mortality, DNR orders were associated with lower intensive care use compared with those without (66.7% vs 80.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with early DNR orders have higher in-hospital mortality rates than those without, but often receive intensive care. These orders have the most impact on the care of patients with the highest mortality risk.",0
Preferences of people living with HIV for injectable and oral antiretroviral treatment in the Netherlands: a discrete choice experiment.,"ABSTRACTInjectable antiretroviral treatment (ART) represents a new effective and potentially more convenient alternative to oral ART for people living with HIV (PLWH). This study assessed preferences of PLWH for long-acting injectable compared with oral ART in the Netherlands. A labelled discrete choice experiment presented 12 choice sets of long-acting injectable and oral ART. PLWH were asked to select their preferred ART, described by six attributes: location of administration, dosing frequency, risk of short-term side effects, drug-drug interaction, forgivability, and food and mealtime restrictions. Random parameters logit and latent class models were used to estimate preferences of PLWH. 98.6% of 76 respondents were experienced oral ART users that had taken ART for a median of 12 years (Q1-Q3: 7.0-20.0). 30 (39.5%) respondents chose long-acting injectable ART in all choice tasks and 22 (28.9%) always chose oral ART. The random parameter model showed that, on average, respondents significantly favoured long-acting injectable ART over oral ART, preferred administration of the long-acting injectable ART at home, and a less frequent regimen. The latent class model confirmed one class strongly preferring long-acting injectable ART and one class slightly preferring oral ART. This study highlights the value for both long-acting injectable and oral ART.",1
"Patients' and Clinicians' Experiences with In-person, Video, and Phone Modalities for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment: A Qualitative Study.","BACKGROUND: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic condition that requires regular visits and care continuity. Telehealth implementation has created multiple visit modalities for OUD care. There is limited knowledge of patients' and clinicians' perceptions and experiences related to multi-modality care and when different modalities might be best employed. OBJECTIVE: To identify patients' and clinicians' experiences with multiple visit modalities for OUD treatment in primary care. DESIGN: Comparative case study, using video- and telephone-based semi-structured interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Patients being treated for OUD (n = 19) and clinicians who provided OUD care (n = 15) from two primary care clinics within the same healthcare system. APPROACH: Using an inductive approach, interviews were analyzed to identify patients' and clinicians' experiences with receiving/delivering OUD care via different visit modalities. Clinicians' and patients' experiences were compared using a group analytical process. KEY RESULTS: Patients and clinicians valued having multiple modalities available for care, with flexibility identified as a key benefit. Patients highlighted the decreased burden of travel and less social anxiety with telehealth visits. Similarly, clinicians reported that telehealth decreased medical intrusion into the lives of patients stable in recovery. Patients and clinicians saw the value of in-person visits when establishing care and for patients needing additional support. In-person visits allowed the ability to conduct urine drug testing, and to foster relationships and trust building, which were more difficult, but not impossible via a telehealth visit. Patients preferred telephone over video visits, as these were more private and more convenient. Clinicians identified benefits of video, including being able to both hear and see the patient, but often deferred to patient preference. CONCLUSIONS: Considerations for utilization of visit modalities for OUD care were identified based on patients' needs and preferences, which often changed over the course of treatment. Continued research is needed determine how visit modalities impact patient outcomes.",0
Chaplain reported plans for end-of-life care conversations: Role clarity for the spiritual care specialists.,"The present study examined chaplain reported plans for patient conversations regarding end-of-life (EOL) care through the lens of multiple goals. Chaplains (n = 69) were asked to curate a plan for engaging with a patient about EOL treatment options, including how they would engage in the conversation and what they would plan to discuss. Findings indicated that plans primarily consisted of relational and identity goals, with a majority navigating multiple goal orientations. Content overwhelmingly involved developing rapport with patients, eliciting patient preferences for care, and serving as a patient liaison. The current study addresses the paucity of research around the role a chaplain plays on the interdisciplinary team and their respective approach to EOL conversations. Examination of curated plans affords insight to what content is prioritized and which conversational goals are present. Integration of multiple goals offers preliminary evidence for conversational quality. Awareness of goal approach and content prioritized affords clarity on how chaplains can be called upon to support members of the interdisciplinary care team.",0
Heterogeneous Preferences for Colorectal Cancer Screening in Germany: Results of a Discrete Choice Experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening tests differ in benefits, harms, and processes, making individual informed decisions preference based. The objective was to analyze the preferences of insurees in Germany for characteristics of CRC screening modalities. METHODS: A generic discrete choice experiment with 2-alternative choice sets and 6 attributes (CRC mortality, CRC incidence, complications, preparation, need for transportation, and follow-up; 3 levels each) depicting characteristics of fecal testing, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy was generated. Participants completed 8 choice tasks. Internal validity was tested using a within-set dominated pair. Between June and October 2020, written questionnaires were sent to a stratified random sample (n = 5000) of 50-, 55-, and 60-year-old insurees of the AOK (Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse) Lower Saxony, who had previously received an invitation to participate in the organized screening program including evidence-based information. Preferences were analyzed using conditional logit, mixed logit, and latent-class model. RESULTS: From 1282 questionnaires received (26% [1282 of 4945]), 1142 were included in the analysis. Approximately 42% of the respondents chose the dominated alternative in the internal validity test. Three heterogeneous preference classes were identified. Most important attributes were preparation (class 1; n = 505, 44%), CRC mortality (class 2; n = 347, 30%), and CRC incidence (class 3; n = 290, 25%). Contrary to a priori expectations, a higher effort was preferred for bowel cleansing (class 1) and accompaniment home (classes 1 and 2). CONCLUSION: Internal validity issues of choice data need further research and warrant attention in future discrete choice experiment surveys. The observed preference heterogeneity suggests different informational needs, although the underlying reasons remained unclear.",1
Evidence-based use of antihistamines for treatment of allergic conditions.,"Available since the 1940s, H(1) antihistamines are mainstay treatments for allergic conditions such as allergic rhinitis and urticaria. They function as inverse agonists that bind to the H(1) receptor to inhibit histamine-induced inflammation. The older, first-generation drugs are no longer recommended for patient use because of their well-documented negative adverse effect profile. Evidence has been accumulating to support a newer generation of H(1) antihistamines in oral and intranasal formulations, including in combination with intranasal corticosteroids. The literature is replete with large meta-analyses and systematic reviews establishing the safety and efficacy of second-generation H(1) antihistamines in adult and pediatric allergic rhinitis populations, including combination nasal spray agents (eg, MP29-02 or MP-AzeFlu). Although intraclass differences do exist, patient preference, access, and costs should be the priority. Robust data on the regular, not as needed use of H(1) antihistamines for urticaria have been published, including in the management of children and pregnant or lactating women. In addition, H(1) antihistamines can be used in other related allergic conditions, such as the secondary symptoms of anaphylaxis, to provide patients with greater comfort, including in allergic asthma, depending on the individual.",0
"Pharmacokinetic characterization, benefits and barriers of subcutaneous administration of monoclonal antibodies in oncology.","OBJECTIVE: Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in oncology are slowly becoming the dominant treatment option for many different cancer types. The main route of administration, infusion, requires extensive product preparations, patient hospitalization and close monitoring. Patient comfort improvement, staff workload reduction and cost savings dictated the development of subcutaneous formulations. The aim of this review is to present pharmacokinetic characteristics of subcutaneous products, discuss the differences between intravenous and subcutaneous routes and to point out the advantages as well as challenges of administration route shift from the formulation development and pharmacometric angle. DATA SOURCES: Food and Drug administration's Purple book database and electronic medicines compendium were used to identify monoclonal antibodies in oncology approved as subcutaneous forms. Using keywords subcutaneous, monoclonal antibodies, pharmacokinetics, model, as well as specific drugs previously identified, both PubMed and ScienceDirect databases were researched. DATA SUMMARY: There are currently six approved subcutaneous onco-monoclonal antibodies on the market. For each of them, exposure to the drug was similar in relation to infusion, treatment effectiveness was the same, administration was well tolerated by the patients and costs of the medical service were reduced. CONCLUSION: Development of subcutaneous forms for existing and emerging new monoclonal antibodies for cancer treatment as well as shifting from administration via infusion should be encouraged due to patient preference, lower costs and overall lack of substantial differences in efficacy and safety between the two routes.",0
Arteriovenous fistula aneurysmorrhaphy is associated with improved patency and decreased vascular access abandonment.,"BACKGROUND: Upper extremity hemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) can become aneurysmal over time due to repeated cannulation and/or outflow steno-occlusive disease. The optimal surgical management of aneurysmal AVFs (aneurysmorrhaphy vs interposition graft) has remained unclear. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review in which current procedural terminology codes were used to screen for patients who had undergone surgical treatment of aneurysmal AVFs between 2016 and 2021 at a single hospital system. The patients were included after a review of the operative reports. The cases were divided by surgical procedure (aneurysmorrhaphy vs interposition graft placement). The patients who had undergone primary AVF ligation or other types of repair were excluded. The primary outcomes were primary assisted and secondary patency, and the secondary outcome was dialysis access abandonment. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to test the association between the type of AVF aneurysm repair and the primary and secondary outcomes. RESULTS: From 2016 to 2021, 6951 patients had undergone 16,190 dialysis access procedures. Of these procedures, 381 (2.4%) were related to surgical treatment of an aneurysmal AVF. We excluded 58 primary AVF ligation cases and 20 cases involving other types of repair, leaving 303 cases for analysis. These were divided into two groups: aneurysmorrhaphy (n = 123; 41%) and interposition graft (n = 180; 59%). No differences were found between the groups in male gender (68% vs 63%), hypertension (98% vs 98%), or central stenosis (14% vs 22%). The patients who had undergone aneurysmorrhaphy were younger (median age, 54 years vs 59 years); had had a lower rate of diabetes (41% vs 59%), coronary artery disease (41% vs 58%), and congestive heart failure (41% vs 55%); and were less likely to have undergone upper arm access (72% vs 92%). The median follow-up was 11.1 months (interquartile range, 3.6-25.2 months). No differences were found in the incidence of 30-day wound complications (1% vs 3%) or surgical site infections (4% vs 6%). On multivariable Cox regression, interposition graft placement was associated with the loss of primary assisted patency (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-4.95), loss of secondary patency (aHR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.21-7.94), and abandonment of dialysis access (aHR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.61-5.87; P < .05 for all) at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: AVF aneurysmorrhaphy was associated with improved primary assisted and secondary patency and decreased abandonment of dialysis access. We suggest using aneurysmorrhaphy when AVF aneurysms are indicated for repair. However, individual factors such as patient comorbidities, AVF anatomy, remaining dialysis access options, and patient preference should be considered when planning the surgical approach.",0
Peri-procedural and mid-term follow-up age-related differences in leadless pacemaker implantation: Insights from a multicenter European registry.,"BACKGROUND: Age-related differences on leadless pacemaker (LP) are poorly described. Aim of this study was to compare clinical indications, periprocedural and mid-term device-associated outcomes in a large real-world cohort of LP patients, stratified by age at implantation. METHODS: Two cohorts of younger and older patients (≤50 and > 50 years old) were retrieved from the iLEAPER registry. The primary outcome was to compare the underlying indication why a LP was preferred over a transvenous PM across the two cohorts. Rates of peri-procedural and mid-term follow-up major complications as well as LP electrical performance were deemed secondary outcomes. RESULTS: 1154 patients were enrolled, with younger patients representing 6.2% of the entire cohort. Infective and vascular concerns were the most frequent characteristics that led to a LP implantation in the older cohort (45.8% vs 67.7%, p < 0.001; 4.2% vs 16.4%, p = 0.006), while patient preference was the leading cause to choose a LP in the younger (47.2% vs 5.6%, p < 0.001). Median overall procedural (52 [40-70] vs 50 [40-65] mins) and fluoroscopy time were similar in both groups. 4.3% of patients experienced periprocedural complications, without differences among groups. Threshold values were higher in the younger, both at discharge and at last follow-up (0.63 [0.5-0.9] vs 0.5 [0.38-0-7] V, p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: When considering LP indications, patient preference was more common in younger, while infective and vascular concerns were more frequent in the older cohort. Rates of device-related complications did not differ significantly. Younger patients tended to have a slightly higher pacing threshold at mid-term follow-up.",0
Patients who have undergone total shoulder arthroplasty prefer greater surgeon involvement in shared decision making.,"BACKGROUND: There has been a shift in medical decision making from a paternalist model to a shared decision-making (SDM) approach, described as a patient-physician relationship where both parties collaborate to arrive on an evidence-based treatment regimen that best suits the patient's needs and values. However, there is a scarcity in evidence regarding SDM in shoulder arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to evaluate overall patient preference for SDM and determine demographic and socioeconomic factors related to SDM preference in those undergoing shoulder arthroplasty. METHODS: Patients aged 40-89 years who had undergone a total shoulder arthroplasty were enrolled. Two-part questionnaires were administered collecting patient demographic information and SDM subscale scores postoperatively. Bivariate and multivariate regression models were used to determine factors associated with SDM Total and subscale scores. RESULTS: A total of 125 patients (53 male; mean age, 69.5 ± 10.4 years) who had undergone primary total shoulder arthroplasty were included. The mean Total SDM score was -2.24 ± 1.9 and the Preoperative, Operative, and Postoperative SDM subscale scores were -1.54 ± 2.0, -2.59 ± 2.2, and -2.48 ± 2.1, respectively, indicating a preference for SDM in the Preoperative subscale and surgeon-driven decision making in the total score and other 2 subscales. Multivariate regression models demonstrated a preference for surgeon decision making at both the 4-12-week postoperative period for the Preoperative subscale (odds ratio [OR] -1.03, 95% CI -2.0, -0.1, P = .039) and the 2-4-week postoperative period for the Operative subscale (OR -1.74, 95% CI -3.4, -0.1, P = .038) when compared to patients at the 2-week postoperative period. No other variables were significantly associated with any of the SDM subscale scores or Total SDM score. CONCLUSION: Patients reported a more passive role in the decision-making process with an overall preference for a surgeon-led approach in primary total shoulder arthroplasty. Patients preferred a shared decision-making approach in regard to preoperative considerations but indicated a significant preference for surgeon-led decision making regarding day of surgery decisions. There were no correlations between SDM scores and age, sex, race, income, education level, insurance type, or treating surgeon. Overall, patients demonstrated a predilection for an SDM approach for preoperative considerations, contrary to those decisions associated with the day of surgery and postoperative care.",0
Real-World Effectiveness of Dolutegravir/Lamivudine in People With HIV-1 in Test-and-Treat Settings or With High Baseline Viral Loads: TANDEM Study Subgroup Analyses.,"INTRODUCTION: Dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC) was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2019 for the treatment of antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive people with HIV-1 based on results from the pivotal GEMINI-1/GEMINI-2 trials. Around that time, immediate initiation of treatment upon diagnosis was recommended in the US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines. Here we report results from 126 treatment-naive people with HIV-1 who initiated DTG/3TC as part of a test-and-treat strategy (n = 61) or with high baseline viral loads (HIV-1 RNA ≥ 100,000 copies/ml; n = 16) from the TANDEM study. METHODS: TANDEM was a US-based, retrospective chart review study that included a cohort of 126 individuals aged ≥ 18 years with no prior history of ART who initiated DTG/3TC before September 30, 2020, and had ≥ 6 months of follow-up. Test-and-treat was defined as ART initiation shortly after diagnosis without available viral load, CD4 + cell count, or HIV-1 resistance data. Outcomes included virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/ml; overall and by baseline viral load) and discontinuations. Analyses were descriptive. RESULTS: Among 61 individuals who initiated DTG/3TC in a test-and-treat setting (median [interquartile range (IQR)] treatment duration, 1.3 [0.9-1.7] years), 57 (93%) achieved virologic suppression, and 51 (84%) remained suppressed; 1 (< 1%) individual discontinued DTG/3TC due to persistent low-level viremia. The most common healthcare provider (HCP)-reported reason for initiating DTG/3TC was avoidance of long-term toxicities among individuals in the test-and-treat subgroup. Of 16 treatment-naive individuals with high baseline viral loads (median [IQR] treatment duration, 100,000-250,000 copies/ml: 1.2 [0.8-1.8] years; > 250,000 copies/ml: 1.0 [0.7-1.1] years), 14 (88%) achieved virologic suppression, 13 (81%) remained suppressed, and none discontinued DTG/3TC. Patient preference was the most common HCP-reported reason for initiating DTG/3TC in this subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate real-world effectiveness of DTG/3TC, with few discontinuations, in people with HIV-1 in test-and-treat settings or with high baseline viral loads.",0
Preferences for Genetic Testing to Predict the Risk of Developing Hereditary Cancer: A Systematic Review of Discrete Choice Experiments.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding service user preferences is key to effective health care decision making and efficient resource allocation. It is of particular importance in the management of high-risk patients in whom predictive genetic testing can alter health outcomes. PURPOSE: This review aims to identify the relative importance and willingness to pay for attributes of genetic testing in hereditary cancer syndromes. DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, HMIC, Web of Science, and EconLit using discrete choice experiment (DCE) terms combined with terms related to hereditary cancer syndromes, malignancy synonyms, and genetic testing. STUDY SELECTION: Following independent screening by 3 reviewers, 7 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, being a DCE investigating patient or public preferences related to predictive genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes. DATA EXTRACTION: Extracted data included study and respondent characteristics, DCE attributes and levels, methods of data analysis and interpretation, and key study findings. DATA SYNTHESIS: Studies covered colorectal, breast, and ovarian cancer syndromes. Results were summarized in a narrative synthesis and the quality assessed using the Lancsar and Louviere framework. LIMITATIONS: This review focuses only on DCE design and testing for hereditary cancer syndromes rather than other complex diseases. Challenges also arose from heterogeneity in attributes and levels. CONCLUSIONS: Test effectiveness and detection rates were consistently important to respondents and thus should be prioritized by policy makers. Accuracy, cost, and wait time, while also important, showed variation between studies, although overall reduction in cost may improve uptake. Patients and the public would be willing to pay for improved detection and clinician over insurance provider involvement. Future studies should seek to contextualize findings by considering the impact of sociodemographic characteristics, health system coverage, and insurance policies on preferences. HIGHLIGHTS: Test effectiveness and detection rates are consistently important to respondents in genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes.Reducing the cost of genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes may improve uptake.Individuals are most willing to pay for a test that improves detection rates, identifies multiple cancers, and for which results are shared with a doctor rather than with an insurance provider.",1
Moral justification for the use of 'add-ons' in assisted reproductive technology: experts' views and experiences.,"RESEARCH QUESTION: What factors do assisted reproductive terchnology (ART) providers take into account when they make decisions about offering 'add-ons'? DESIGN: A qualitative analysis of interviews with 31 ART professionals, focusing on their views and experiences in relation to add-ons, including the factors that are considered when doctors make decisions about their use. RESULTS: The participants reported that a range of considerations are taken into account when it comes to justifying the use of a particular add-on in a given circumstance, including the likelihood of benefit and harm, patients' perceived psychological needs and preferences, and organizational expectations. Importantly, patient preferences, psychological factors and low risk of harm appear to be stronger motivations than increasing the likelihood of a live birth or the desire to innovate. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that it cannot be taken for granted that add-ons and innovation are closely linked. One possible response to this would be regulatory reform; for example, only allowing 'unproven' add-ons to be used in the context of formal scientific evaluation. Alternatively, it could be made clear that add-ons that are not undergoing formal evaluation have more in common with other therapies lacking a clear evidence base, such as complementary and alternative medicines, than with conventional medical practice. Practices in relation to add-ons may also require a focus on the responsibilities of corporations, and the standards applying to purveyors of consumer goods and services.",0
Factors that shape recurrent miscarriage care experiences: findings from a national survey.,"BACKGROUND: Learning what matters to women/couples with recurrent miscarriage (RM) is essential to inform service improvement efforts and future RM care practices. Previous national and international surveys have examined inpatient stays, maternity care, and care experiences around pregnancy loss, but there is little focus on RM care. We aimed to explore the experiences of women and men who have received RM care and identify patient-centred care items linked to overall RM care experience. METHODS: Between September and November 2021, we invited people who had experienced two or more consecutive first trimester miscarriages and received care for RM in Ireland in the ten-year period prior to participate in a cross-sectional web-based national survey. The survey was purposefully designed and administered via Qualtrics. It included questions on sociodemographics, pregnancy and pregnancy loss history, investigation and treatment for RM, overall RM care experience, and patient-centred care items at various stages of the RM care pathway such as respect for patients' preferences, information and support, the environment, and involvement of partners/family. We analysed data using Stata. RESULTS: We included 139 participants (97% women, n = 135) in our analysis. Of the 135 women, 79% were aged 35-44 years (n = 106), 24% rated their overall RM care experience as poor (n = 32), 36% said the care they received was much worse than expected (n = 48), and 60% stated health care professionals in different places did not work well together (n = 81). Women were more likely to rate a good care experience if they had a healthcare professional to talk to about their worries/fears for RM investigations (RRR 6.11 [95% CI: 1.41-26.41]), received a treatment plan (n = 70) (RRR 3.71 [95% CI: 1.28-10.71]), and received answers they could understand in a subsequent pregnancy (n = 97) (RRR 8 [95% CI: 0.95-67.13]). CONCLUSIONS: While overall experience of RM care was poor, we identified areas that could potentially improve people's RM care experiences - which have international relevance - such as information provision, supportive care, communication between healthcare professionals and people with RM, and care coordination between healthcare professionals across care settings.",0
Cost-Utility Analysis of the Port Delivery System with Ranibizumab for Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"PURPOSE: To quantify the cost-utility ratio of the ranibizumab Port Delivery System (PDS; SUSVIMO) versus intravitreal ranibizumab injections for treating neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) based upon Archway Phase 3 Trial data. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. SUBJECTS: Archway Phase 3 Clinical Trial nAMD participants previously responsive to anti-VEGF therapy were randomized 3:2. Two hundred forty received PDS refills q 24 weeks and 162 received ranibizumab injections. METHODS: Ophthalmic patient, time tradeoff utilities, direct medical and societal cost perspectives, 12-year, 1-year, and 5-year timelines, United States 2022 real dollars, and a 3% annual discount rate were employed. Utilities were adjusted for nAMD conversion in fellow eyes during the 12-year, mean participant life expectancy. Premature death associated with severe vision loss was integrated as per the population-based Salisbury Eye Evaluation Study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) accruals, costs, and incremental and average cost-utility ratios in $/QALY (dollars expended per QALY gained). RESULTS: Versus no therapy, the 1-year PDS QALY gain was 0.0156 (6.8%) versus 0.0063 (0.82%) for intravitreal injections (P < 0.001), whereas the respective 12-year QALY gains were 1.714 (28%) and 1.639 (26.8%) (P = 0.99). One-year direct PDS ophthalmic costs totaled $21 825 with 2 ranibizumab fills, whereas ranibizumab injection therapy totaled $18 405 with 11.8 injections. The 1-year incremental PDS $/QALY versus injections was cost effective at $75 497/QALY. Five-year PDS therapy was not incrementally cost effective at $304 108/QALY, nor was the 12-year therapy at $761 646/QALY. Average 12-year cost-utility ratios were $78 773/QALY for the PDS and $47 917/QALY for injection therapy. Adding -$476 442 12-year offsetting societal costs netted $314 521 to society per PDS participant versus $370 958 per participant for injection therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ranibizumab PDS therapy was not incrementally cost effective versus ranibizumab injection therapy at 12 or 5 years but was at 1 year. Injection therapy had a more favorable 12-year average cost-utility ratio. Vision gain was the major determinant of participant value gain and was the same for both interventions. Both interventions were highly cost effective utilizing average cost-utility analysis with the societal cost perspective.

"Shared Decision-Making in the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis: Results of a Cross-Sectional, Real-World Survey in Europe and the United States.","INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive deterioration of cognitive and physical functioning, reducing activities of daily living and quality of life (QoL). Several treatments are available that modify the course of the disease and reduce the frequency of relapses. Although effective, all treatment options are accompanied by adverse events, and this study aimed to assess the extent to which patients were involved in the choice of treatment. METHODS: Data were drawn from the Adelphi Multiple Sclerosis Disease Specific Program (DSP)™, a cross-sectional survey of healthcare practitioners (HCP) and their patients with MS in real-world clinical settings in Europe and the United States (US) between December 2020 and July 2021. HCPs reported patient demographics, clinical characteristics, current and previous treatment, and treatment outcomes. Patients voluntarily completed questionnaires reporting the physical and psychological impact of their MS and its treatment. Regression analysis with inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to compare treatment outcomes in patients actively involved in their current treatment choice with those who were not. RESULTS: Of a total of 692 patients, median age 40 years and 64% female, mostly diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS, those who were involved in shared decision-making tended to choose oral therapies such as dimethyl fumarate more often than HCPs. MS had greater impact on physical and psychological functioning in patients whose HCP made treatment decisions solely. Patients involved in decision-making reported greater satisfaction with their treatment and a better QoL. DISCUSSION: Because no single optimal therapy exists for patients with MS, treatments should be individualized with consideration of patients' preferences. Our study shows that shared decision-making is under-utilized in the management of MS and supports the benefits of patient involvement. CONCLUSION: Patients who have an active role in treatment decision-making show improved wellbeing and QoL, and overall treatment satisfaction.",0
Cutaneous Sarcoidosis.,"Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease that most commonly affects the lungs, lymphatic system, eyes, and skin but any organ may be involved. Cutaneous sarcoidosis most commonly presents as pink-red to red-brown papules and plaques that commonly affect the head and neck. With the skin being readily accessible for evaluation and biopsy, when sarcoidosis is suspected, dermatologic evaluation may be helpful for establishing a definitive diagnosis. Treatment strategy depends on the severity and distribution of skin lesions and should incorporate patient preference and treatment considerations for other organs that may be involved.",0
Patient preferences for newer oral therapies in type 2 diabetes.,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate patient preferences towards three oral antihyperglycaemic therapies using conjoint analysis to determine which attributes may influence use. METHODS: We used an online survey, completed by 553 US respondents with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; mean age 64 ± 9 years; 55% had cardiovascular [CV] risk; 27% had CV disease), to present hypothetical, blinded, pairwise, drug profile comparison choices, between different benefit/risk attributes and effect ranges. Attributes were derived from phase 3 trials for empagliflozin 25 mg (SGLT2 inhibitor), oral semaglutide 14 mg (GLP-1 receptor agonist) and sitagliptin 100 mg (DPP-4 inhibitor). Predicted therapy preference outcomes and relative importance of each attribute were calculated (presented as a percentage). RESULTS: Preference score was highest for the profile matching empagliflozin (56%), versus sitagliptin (38%; z-test, P < 0.001) and oral semaglutide (6%, z-test, P < 0.001). Results were overall consistent in subgroup analyses. Genital infection risk was the most important attribute (relative score: 19% [z-test, P = 0.077]). Other important attributes were fasting requirements (15%), weight reduction (15%), risk of vomiting (14%), CV benefit (12%), and risk of nausea (11%). HbA1c reduction (8%) and ability to take medication with other drugs (6%) were considered less important. While blinded to drug name/dose, respondents chose a drug profile similar to empagliflozin (41%) versus sitagliptin (31%), oral semaglutide (11%), or 'none of the options' (17%). CONCLUSION: While the drug profile comparable to empagliflozin was preferred, CV benefit was not the top patient priority. A shared physician-patient decision model and increased patient education are needed to ensure optimal use of guideline-directed T2DM therapies.",1
Comparison of the Novel Digital Multi-dimension Botong Score with the Brief Pain Inventory for Evaluating Cancer-Related Pain: A Randomized Crossover Trial.,"INTRODUCTION: Pain is a common symptom in patients with cancer, and comprehensive assessments of pain are crucial for decision-making of treatment regimens. This study aimed to compare the practicality of the novel digital multi-dimension Botong score (BTS) and the brief pain inventory (BPI) for evaluating cancer-related pain. METHODS: This randomized crossover trial enrolled patients with cancer-related pain at the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Shandong First Medical University between July and December 2022. The participants were randomized 1:1 to BTS evaluation followed by BPI or vice versa. The consistency of BTS and BPI was analyzed, including pain score and the impact of pain on emotions and sleep. The convenience, patient preference, and the filling time of the two tools were compared. The accuracy of BTS in detecting breakthrough pain and neuropathic pain was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 308 patients with cancer-related pain were screened and 233 were finally included in the analysis. The Pearson correlation coefficients of pain score for BTS and BPI (4 relevant questions) were 0.583 for the worst pain score within 24 h, 0.394 for the mildest pain score within 24 h, 0.551 for the average pain score within 24 h, and 0.511 for the current pain score, respectively (all P < 0.01), indicating a positive correlation between the BTS and BPI pain scores. BTS was superior to BPI for filling time, convenience, and patient preference (191.03 vs. 256.76, 7.70 vs. 6.78, 7.58 vs. 6.70; all P < 0.01). The accuracy of BTS in detecting breakthrough pain and neuropathic pain was 98.28% and 97.42%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Pain scores evaluated by BTS have a positive correlation with those evaluated by BPI. BTS reduces the filling time, is more convenient to use, and is more favored by patients. In addition, BTS could help identify breakthrough pain and neuropathic pain. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chictr.org.cn, identifier: ChiCTR220062624.",0
Experience with the US health care system for Black and White patients with advanced prostate cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess differences in reported information about treatment, integration into care, and respect by self-identified Black and White individuals with advanced prostate cancer in the United States. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 701 participants (20% identifying as Black) enrolled in the International Registry for Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer at 37 US sites from 2017 to 2022. Participants were asked six questions from the Cancer Australia National Cancer Control Indicators about their experience with care at study enrollment. Prevalence differences by self-reported race were estimated using marginal standardization of logistic-normal mixed effects models (adjusted for age at enrollment and disease state at enrollment), and 95% CIs were estimated using parametric bootstrapping. RESULTS: Most participants reported a high quality of care for each question. Black participants generally reported higher care quality compared with White participants. Black participants reported more frequently that they were offered a written assessment and care plan (71%) compared with White participants (58%; adjusted difference, 13 percentage points; 95% CI, 4-23). Black participants also reported more frequently being given the name of nonphysician personnel who would support them (64%) than White participants (52%; adjusted difference, 10; 95% CI, 1-20). Prevalence differences did not differ by disease state at enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: Black participants generally reported a higher quality of care compared with White participants. This study calls attention to the need to study potential mediating factors and interpersonal aspects of care in this population to improve survivorship.",0
Pharmacological and Non-pharmacological Approaches for the Management of Neuropathic Pain in Multiple Sclerosis.,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the central nervous system and can cause various types of pain including ongoing extremity pain, Lhermitte's phenomenon, trigeminal neuralgia, and mixed pain. Neuropathic pain is a major concern for individuals with multiple sclerosis as it is directly linked to myelin damage in the central nervous system and the management of neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis is challenging as the options available have limited efficacy and can cause unpleasant side effects. The literature search was conducted across two databases, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Eligible studies included clinical trials, observational studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and narrative reviews. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of literature on pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies employed in the management of neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis. Pharmacological options include cannabinoids, muscle relaxants (tizanidine, baclofen, dantrolene), anticonvulsants (benzodiazepines, gabapentin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine), antidepressants (duloxetine, venlafaxine, tricyclic antidepressants), opioids (naltrexone), and botulinum toxin variants, which have evidence from various clinical trials. Non-pharmacological approaches for trigeminal neuralgia may include neurosurgical methods. Non-invasive methods, physical therapy, and psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction) may be recommended for patients with neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis. The choice of treatment depends on the severity and type of pain as well as other factors, such as patient preferences and comorbidities. There is a pressing need for healthcare professionals and researchers to prioritize the development of better strategies for managing multiple sclerosis-induced neuropathic pain.",0
Burden and prognostic impact of cardiovascular disease in patients with cancer.,"The number of patients at the intersection of cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) is increasing, reflecting ageing global populations, rising burden of shared cardiometabolic risk factors, and improved cancer survival. Many cancer treatments carry a risk of cardiotoxicity. Baseline cardiovascular risk assessment is recommended in all patients with cancer and requires consideration of individual patient risk and the cardiotoxicity profile of proposed anticancer therapies. Patients with pre-existing CVD are potentially at high or very high risk of cancer-therapy related cardiovascular toxicity. The detection of pre-existing CVD should prompt cardiac optimisation and planning of surveillance during cancer treatment. In patients with severe CVD, the risk of certain cancer therapies may be prohibitively high. Such decisions require multidisciplinary discussion with consideration of alternative anti-cancer therapies, risk-benefit assessment, and patient preference. Current practice is primarily guided by expert opinion and data from select clinical cohorts. There is need for development of a stronger evidence base to guide clinical practice in cardio-oncology. The establishment of multicentre international registries and national-level healthcare data linkage projects are important steps towards facilitating enrichment of cardio-oncology research programmes. In this narrative review, we consider epidemiological trends of cancer and CVD comorbidities and the impact of their co-occurrence on clinical outcomes, current approach to supporting cancer patients with pre-existing CVD and gaps in existing knowledge.",0
Use of Acellular Biologic Matrix Envelope for Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Placement to Correct Migration into Submuscular Breast Implant Pocket.,"Breast implants whether used for cosmetic or reconstructive purposes can be placed in pockets either above or below the pectoralis major muscle, depending on clinical circumstances such as subcutaneous tissue volume, history of radiation, and patient preference. Likewise, cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) can be placed above or below the pectoralis major muscle. When a patient has both devices, knowledge of the pocket location is important for procedural planning and for durability of device placement and performance. Here, we report a patient who previously failed subcutaneous CIED placement due to incision manipulation with prior threatened device exposure requiring plane change to subpectoral pocket. Her course was complicated by submuscular migration of the CIED into her breast implant periprosthetic pocket. With subcutaneous plane change being inadvisable due to patient noncompliance, soft tissue support of subpectoral CIED placement with an acellular biologic matrix (ABM) was performed. Similar to soft tissue support used for breast implants, submuscular CIED neo-pocket creation with ABM was performed with durable CIED device positioning confirmed at 9 months postprocedure.",0
Primary Care Team Perspectives on the Suitability of Telehealth Modality (Phone vs Video) at the Veterans Health Administration.,"INTRODUCTION: Telehealth has the potential to improve access and timeliness of care, enabling primary care teams to deliver hybrid (virtual/in-person) services that will likely extend beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. To optimize its use and sustainability, it is imperative to understand how primary care teams perceive the suitability of telehealth services, including appropriate choice of mode (telephone or video). However, there is limited research on providers' decision-making processes surrounding telehealth use in primary care, including whether to use telephone or video, which this VA-focused study addresses. We examined how primary care (PC) team members determine whether to use telehealth and the mode of delivery, in the care of patients. METHODS: Qualitative case study that included 15 semi-structured interviews with employees who provided or supported telehealth care at primary care clinics at the Veterans Health Administration. We used a team-based rapid analysis approach to identify experiences using telehealth soon after COVID-19's emergence, consisting of the creation of structured summaries of each transcribed interview. The lead author then identified and compiled themes and sub-themes related to the suitability of telehealth in primary care, as well as associated quotes from transcripts. Resulting themes and quotes were reviewed and validated by 2 members of the project team. RESULTS: Primary care team members considered several factors when assessing both the suitability of telehealth for appointments, and mode of use. They were largely guided by patient-related factors including patient preferences, specific health issues, and access to technology. Additional considerations centered on team members' personal preferences and factors that supported the wellbeing of the team, such as the flexibility to work from home (work-life balance) and protection from infection. Generally, participants viewed the option of both telephone and video telehealth modalities as useful tools in the care of patients although a few respondents emphasized its inferiority to in-person care. CONCLUSIONS: Determining the suitability of telehealth services, including appropriate choice of mode is complex. Its suitability is tied to a variety of factors related to multilevel resources, preferences, and timing. When appropriate, telehealth should be considered a useful tool in the care of patients and for employee well-being.",0
"Development of a Specific Variant of Patient Benefit Index (PBI) Assessing Patient Needs, Goals and Benefits in Rosacea Treatment.","INTRODUCTION: Evaluation of patient-reported outcomes including health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and perceived benefits from treatment has become a fundamental component of medical decision-making. Standardized evaluation of treatment benefits in rosacea based on patient preferences is still lacking. OBJECTIVE: Development and validation of an instrument for recording patient-defined benefits in rosacea therapy based on the Patient Benefit Index (PBI) methodology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an open survey of n = 50 patients, potential benefits of therapy from the patient's perspective were examined. The generated item pool was combined with pre-existing PBI items for other skin conditions and reviewed by an expert panel of dermatologists, psychologists and patients. Items were condensed to n = 25 and converted into a Likert-scaled questionnaire. The validity and feasibility of the resulting Patient Benefit Index for rosacea (PBI-RO) were tested on individuals with rosacea recruited from a German rosacea patient organization. RESULTS: N = 446 patients with rosacea completed the PBI-RO. The internal consistencies measured by Cronbach's alpha were high (Patient Needs Questionnaire [PNQ] 0.94). Mean PBI-RO was 1.9 ± 1.2 (scale from 0 = no benefit to 4 = maximum benefit), 23.5% of the patients experienced a PBI-RO < 1 (no clinically relevant benefit). The PBI-RO correlated with HRQoL, health state, current extent of rosacea lesions and treatment satisfaction. The highest correlation was found between PBI-RO and satisfaction with previous treatment (r = -0.59, p < 0.001); correlation with the extent of rosacea lesions was low (r = 0.16, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The PBI-RO shows satisfying internal consistency and construct validity. It offers the option of a patient-weighted evaluation of the therapeutic benefit of rosacea therapy and may add to more stringent goal orientation in therapy.",0

Factors Influencing Preferences of Patients With Rheumatic Diseases Regarding Telehealth Channels for Support With Medication Use: Qualitative Study.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with rheumatic diseases are known to experience drug-related problems at various times during their treatment. As these problems can negatively influence patients' health, they should be prevented or resolved as soon as possible, for which patients might benefit from additional support. Telehealth has the potential to continuously provide information and offers the possibility to easily contact a health care provider in order to support patients with medication use. Knowledge of factors influencing the patient's preference for telehealth channels can improve the actual use of telehealth channels. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify factors that influence the preferences of patients with rheumatic diseases regarding telehealth channels for support with medication use. METHODS: A qualitative study with face-to-face interviews was performed among patients with an inflammatory rheumatic disease in the Netherlands. A total of 4 telehealth channels were used: a frequently asked questions page, a digital human, an app for SMS text messaging with health care providers, and an app for video-calling with health care providers. Using a semistructured interview guide based on domains of the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior (COM-B) model, participants were questioned about (1) their general opinion on the 4 telehealth channels, (2) factors influencing preference for individual telehealth channels, and (3) factors influencing preference for individual telehealth channels in relation to the other available channels. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and categorically analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients were interviewed (female: n=8, 53%; male: n=7, 47%; mean age 55, SD 16.8 years; median treatment duration of 41, IQR 12-106 months). The following 3 categories of factors influencing patient preference regarding telehealth channels were identified: (1) problem-related factors included problems needing a visual check, problems specifically related to the patient, and urgency of the problem; (2) patient-related factors included personal communication preference and patient characteristics; and (3) channel-related factors included familiarity with the telehealth channel, direct communication with a health care provider, methods of searching, and conversation history. CONCLUSIONS: Preference for telehealth channels is influenced by factors related to the problem experienced, the patient experiencing the problem, and telehealth channel characteristics. As the preference for telehealth channels varies between these categories, multiple telehealth channels should be offered to enable patients to tailor the support with their medication use to their needs.",0
Patients accept therapy using embryonic stem cells for Parkinson's disease: a discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: New disease-modifying ways to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) may soon become a reality with intracerebral transplantation of cell products produced from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The aim of this study was to assess what factors influence preferences of patients with PD regarding stem-cell based therapies to treat PD in the future. METHODS: Patients with PD were invited to complete a web-based discrete choice experiment to assess the importance of the following attributes: (i) type of treatment, (ii) aim of treatment, (iii) available knowledge of the different types of treatments, (iv) effect on symptoms, and (v) risk for severe side effects. Latent class conditional logistic regression models were used to determine preference estimates and heterogeneity in respondents' preferences. RESULTS: A substantial difference in respondents' preferences was observed in three latent preference patterns (classes). ""Effect on symptoms"" was the most important attribute in class 1, closely followed by ""type of treatment,"" with medications as preferred to other treatment alternatives. Effect on symptoms was also the most important attribute in class 2, with treatment with hESCs preferred over other treatment alternatives. Likewise for class 3, that mainly focused on ""type of treatment"" in the decision-making. Respondents' class membership was influenced by their experience in treatment, side effects, and advanced treatment therapy as well as religious beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the respondents would accept a treatment with products emanating from hESCs, regardless of views on the moral status of embryos. Preferences of patients with PD may provide guidance in clinical decision-making regarding treatments deriving from stem cells.",1
"Society of Surgical Oncology Breast Disease Site Working Group Statement on Contralateral Mastectomy: Indications, Outcomes, and Risks.","Rates of contralateral mastectomy (CM) among patients with unilateral breast cancer have been increasing in the United States. In this Society of Surgical Oncology position statement, we review the literature addressing the indications, risks, and benefits of CM since the society's 2017 statement. We held a virtual meeting to outline key topics and then conducted a literature search using PubMed to identify relevant articles. We reviewed the articles and made recommendations based on group consensus. Patients consider CM for many reasons, including concerns regarding the risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC), desire for improved cosmesis and symmetry, and preferences to avoid ongoing screening, whereas surgeons primarily consider CBC risk when making a recommendation for CM. For patients with a high risk of CBC, CM reduces the risk of new breast cancer, however it is not known to convey an overall survival benefit. Studies evaluating patient satisfaction with CM and reconstruction have yielded mixed results. Imaging with mammography within 12 months before CM is recommended, but routine preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging is not; there is also no evidence to support routine postmastectomy imaging surveillance. Because the likelihood of identifying an occult malignancy during CM is low, routine sentinel lymph node surgery is not recommended. Data on the rates of postoperative complications are conflicting, and such complications may not be directly related to CM. Adjuvant therapy delays due to complications have not been reported. Surgeons can reduce CM rates by encouraging shared decision making and informed discussions incorporating patient preferences.",0
Acceptability and Feasibility of a Patient-Oriented Music Intervention to Reduce Pain in the Intensive Care Unit: Protocol for a Crossover Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Many patients experience pain in the intensive care unit (ICU) despite receiving pain medication. Research has shown that music can help reduce pain. Music interventions studied so far have not used music streaming to generate playlists based on patient preferences while incorporating recommended tempo and duration. Previous research has focused on postoperative ICU patients able to self-report, which is underrepresentative of the ICU population that might benefit from a music intervention for pain management. We developed a new patient-oriented music intervention (POMI) that incorporates features based on theoretical, empirical, and experiential data intended to be used in the ICU. Such a music intervention should consider the expertise of ICU patients, family members, and nursing staff, as well as the practicality of the intervention when used in practice. OBJECTIVE: The primary objectives of this study are to (1) evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the POMI to reduce pain in ICU patients and (2) evaluate the feasibility of conducting a crossover pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) for intervention testing in the ICU. A secondary objective is to examine the preliminary efficacy of the POMI to reduce pain in ICU patients. METHODS: A single-blind 2×2 crossover pilot RCT will be conducted. Patients will undergo 1 sequence of 2 interventions: the POMI which delivers music based on patients' preferences via headphones or music pillow for 20-30 minutes and the control intervention (headphones or pillow without music). The sequence of the interventions will be inverted with a 4-hour washout period. Timing of the interventions will be before a planned bed turning procedure. Each patient will undergo 1 session of music. Twenty-four patients will be recruited. Patients able to self-report (n=12), family members of patients unable to self-report (n=12), and nursing staff (n=12) involved in the bed turning procedure will be invited to complete a short questionnaire on the POMI acceptability. Data will be collected on the feasibility of the intervention delivery (ie, time spent creating a playlist, any issue related to headphones/pillow or music delivery, environmental noises, and intervention interruptions) and research methods (ie, number of patients screened, recruited, randomized, and included in the analysis). Pain scores will be obtained before and after intervention delivery. RESULTS: Recruitment and data collection began in March 2022. As of July 5, 2022, in total, 22 patients, 12 family members, and 11 nurses were recruited. CONCLUSIONS: Methodological limitations and strengths are discussed. Study limitations include the lack of blinding for patients able to self-report. Strengths include collecting data from various sources, getting a comprehensive evaluation of the intervention, and using a crossover pilot RCT design, where participants act as their own control, thus reducing confounding factors.

Is there a role for biomarkers in asymptomatic severe chronic primary mitral regurgitation?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common heart valve disease with a rising prevalence with the aging populations worldwide. The timing of surgical intervention in patients who have severe MR but remain asymptomatic is often debated. Herein we synthesize the latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and European Society of Cardiology/ European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (ESC/EACTS) heart valve guidelines in such patients and illustrate how circulating and/or imaging biomarkers can be used to help refine decision making algorithms. RECENT FINDINGS: The approach to decision making and strength of guideline recommendations in patients with asymptomatic stage C1 (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] > 60% and left ventricular end systolic dimension [LVESD] < 40 mm) and stage C2 disease (LVEF ≤ 60% and/or LVESD ≥ 40 mm) are reviewed. While surgical intervention is clearly indicated in patients with stage C2 disease, a multifaceted approach that integrates repairability, expertise, sub-clinical evidence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and patient preferences is required to identify the optimal approach to surveillance vs. surgery. The role of imaging (3D echocardiography, contrast echocardiography, left ventricular global longitudinal strain, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging [CMR]) and circulating (natriuretic peptides) biomarkers in decision making is also reviewed. SUMMARY: The decision making around timing of intervention in chronic primary MR requires a personalized approach that is based on accurate assessments of severity of MR, LV dimensions, LV function, valve morphology/repairability, surgeon and center expertise, and patient wishes. Biomarkers hold promise in refining decision making.",0
Preferences for Palliative and End-of-Life Care: A Systematic Review of Discrete Choice Experiments.,"OBJECTIVES: Understanding what matters most to patients and their caregivers is fundamental to delivering high-quality care. This systematic review aimed to characterize and appraise the evidence from discrete choice experiments eliciting preferences for palliative care. METHODS: A systematic literature search was undertaken for publications up until August 2022. Data were synthesized narratively. Thematic analysis was applied to categorize attributes into groups. Attribute development, frequency, and relative importance were analyzed. Subgroup analyses were conducted to compare outcomes between patient and proxy respondents. RESULTS: Seventeen studies spanning 11 countries were included; 59% of studies solely considered preferences for patients with cancer. A range of respondent groups were represented including patients (76%) and proxies (caregivers [35%], health providers [12%], and the public [18%]). A total of 117 individual attributes were extracted and thematically grouped into 8 broad categories and 21 subcategories. Clinical outcomes including quality of life, length of life, and pain control were the most frequently reported attributes, whereas attributes relating to psychosocial components were largely absent. Both patients and proxy respondents prioritized pain control over additional survival time. Nevertheless, there were differences between respondent cohorts in the emphasis on other attributes such as access to care, timely information, and low risk of adverse effects (prioritized by patients), as opposed to cost, quality, and delivery of care (prioritized by proxies). CONCLUSIONS: Our review underscores the vital role of pain control in palliative care; in addition, it shed light on the complexity and relative strength of preferences for various aspects of care from multiple perspectives, which is useful in developing personalized, patient-centered models of care for individuals nearing the end of life.",1
Effect of neridronate on axial involvement in patients with spondyloarthritis when biologics are not possible. Results of a monocentric study.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aims to examine the potential effectiveness of intravenous neridronate (IVNer) on axial involvement in patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA) refractory to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) but not eligible for biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). METHOD: Patients with active SpA (BASDAI score ≥ 4) and active sacroiliitis (SI) on MRI (according to ASAS MRI definition), who were NSAID-insufficient responder/intolerant but not eligible for bDMARDs, were retrospectively recruited in a tertiary rheumatology centre between September 2015 and December 2021. IVNer (100 mg) was administered to the patients on days 1, 4, 7, and 10. Responses were evaluated 60 days after the last infusion as the median changes from the baseline of BASDAI and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain and there are improvements on MRI signs. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients (26 axial SpA, 3 enteropathic arthritis, and 9 axial psoriatic arthritis) were included [66% women, mean age ± SD: 38.0 ± 14.1 years, mean disease duration: 30.5 ± 49.5 months (range 1.0-298), 47% HLAB27+]. The reason for bDMARD ineligibility was concurrent solid tumors (n = 6) or hematological (n = 1) malignancy, comorbidities (n = 11), or patient preference (n = 20). Both median BASDAI [5.83 (4.2-8.33) versus 3.66 (1.1-6.85), p < 0.001] and VAS pain [7 (5.75-8.0) versus 3 (1.0-7.0), p < 0.0001] significantly decreased after IVNer. Of 28 available MRI at follow-up, we observed a complete (36%) or partial (39%) resolution of sacroiliitis or a persistent activity (25%). DISCUSSION: IVNer was effective in improving axial involvement in patients with SpA refractory to NSAIDs but not eligible for bDMARDs. IVNer can be considered as a potential alternative therapeutic option in selected settings.",0
"Short-term anti-TNF therapy with surgical closure versus anti-TNF therapy alone for Crohn's perianal fistulas (PISA-II): long-term outcomes of an international, multicentre patient preference, randomised controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: The PISA-II trial showed that short-term anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy followed by surgical closure induces radiological healing of perianal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease more frequently than anti-TNF therapy alone after 18 months. This study aimed to compare long-term outcomes of both treatment arms. METHODS: Follow-up data were collected from patients who participated in the PISA-II trial, an international patient preference randomised controlled trial. This multicentre trial was performed in nine hospitals in the Netherlands and one hospital in Italy. Patients with Crohn's disease above the age of 18 years with an active high perianal fistula and a single internal opening were asked to participate. Patients were allocated to anti-TNF therapy (intravenous infliximab, or subcutaneous adalimumab, at the discretion of the gastroenterologist) for one year, or surgical closure combined with 4-months anti-TNF therapy. Patients without a treatment preference were randomised (1:1) using random block randomisation (block sizes of six without stratification), and patients with a treatment preference were treated according to their preferred treatment arm. For the current follow-up study, data were collected until May 2022. Primary outcome was radiological healing on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including all participants with a MRI made less than 6 months ago at the time of data collection. Analysis was based on observed data. FINDINGS: Between September 14, 2013, and December 7, 2019, 94 patients were enrolled in the trial. Long-term follow-up data were available in 91 patients (36/38 (95%) anti-TNF + surgical closure, 55/56 (98%) anti-TNF). A total of 14/36 (39%) patients in the surgical closure arm were randomly assigned, which was not significantly different in the anti-TNF treatment arm (16/55 (29%) randomly assigned). Median follow-up was 5.7 years (interquartile range (IQR) 5-7). Radiological healing occurred significantly more often after anti-TNF + surgical closure (15/36 = 42% versus 10/55 = 18%; P = 0.014). Clinical closure was comparable (26/36 = 72% versus 34/55 = 62%; P = 0.18) in both groups. However, clinical closure in the surgical group was achieved with less re-interventions 4/26 (= 15%) versus 18/34 (= 53%), including (redo-)surgical closure procedures. Recurrences occurred in 0/25 (0%) patients with radiological healing versus 27/76 (36%) patients with clinical closure, sometime during follow-up. Anti-TNF trough levels were higher in patients with long-term clinical closure in both groups (P = 0.031 and P = 0.014). In 6/11 (55%) patients in the anti-TNF group with available trough levels, recurrences were diagnosed within three months of a drop under 3.5ug/ml. 36 patients stopped anti-TNF, after which 0/14 (0%) patients with radiological healing developed a recurrence and 9/22 (41%) with clinical closure. Self-rated (in)continence was comparable between groups, and 79% (60/76) of patients indicated comparable/improved continence after treatment. Decision-regret analysis showed that all (30/30) anti-TNF + surgical closure patients agreed or strongly agreed that surgery was the right decision versus 78% (36/46) in the anti-TNF arm. All surgical closure patients would go for the same treatment again, whereas this was 89% (41/46) in the anti-TNF arm. INTERPRETATION: This study confirmed that surgical closure should be considered in amenable patients with perianal fistulas and Crohn's disease as long-term outcomes were favourable, and that radiological healing should be the aim of treatment as recurrences only occurred in patients without radiological healing. In patients with complete MRI closure, anti-TNF could be safely stopped. FUNDING: None.",0
Cancer treatments touch a wide range of values that count for patients and other stakeholders: What are the implications for decision-making?,"BACKGROUND: Cancer rates and expenditures are increasing, resulting in debates on the exact value of this care. Perspectives on what exactly constitutes worthwhile values differ. This study aims to explore all values-elements regarding new oncological treatments for patients with cancer and all stakeholders involved and to assess their implications in different decision-making procedures. METHOD: Thirty-one individual in-depth interviews were conducted with different stakeholders to identify values within oncology. A focus group with seven experts was performed to explore its possible implications in decision-making procedures. RESULTS: The overarching themes of values identified were impact on daily life and future, costs for patients and loved ones, quality of life, impact on loved ones, societal impact and quality of treatments. The expert panel revealed that the extended exploration of values that matter to patients is deemed useful in patient-level decision-making, information provision, patient empowerment and support during and after treatment. For national reimbursement decisions, implications for the broad range of values seems less clear. CONCLUSION: Clinical values are not the only ones that matter to oncological patients and the stakeholders in the field. We found a much broader range of values. Proper recognition of values that count might add to patient-level decision-making, but implications for reimbursement decisions are less clear. The results could be useful to guide clinicians and policymakers when it comes to decision-making in oncology. Making more explicit which values counts for whom guarantees a more systematic approach to decision-making on all levels.",0
"Effectiveness of group arts therapies (art therapy, dance movement therapy and music therapy) compared to group counselling for diagnostically heterogeneous psychiatric community patients: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial in mental health ","BACKGROUND: Arts therapies are widely but inconsistently provided in community mental health. Whilst they are appealing to patients, evidence for their effectiveness is mixed. Trials to date have been limited to one art-form or diagnosis. Patients may hold strong preferences for or against an art-form whilst group therapies rely on heterogeneity to provide a range of learning experiences. This study will test whether manualised group arts therapies (art therapy, dance movement therapy and music therapy) are effective in reducing psychological distress for diagnostically heterogeneous patients in community mental health compared to active group counselling control. METHODS: A pragmatic multi-centre 2-arm randomised controlled superiority trial with health economic evaluation and nested process evaluation. Adults aged ≥ 18, living in the community with a primary diagnosis of psychosis, mood, or anxiety disorder will be invited to participate and provide written informed consent. Participants are eligible if they score ≥ 1.65 on the Global Severity Index of the Brief Symptom Inventory. Those eligible will view videos of arts therapies and be asked for their preference. Participants are randomised to either their preferred type of group arts therapy or counselling. Groups will run twice per week in a community venue for 20 weeks. Our primary outcome is symptom distress at the end of intervention. Secondary outcomes include observer-rated symptoms, social situation and quality of life. Data will be collected at baseline, post-intervention and 6 and 12 months post-intervention. Outcome assessors and trial statisticians will be blinded. Analysis will be intention-to-treat. Economic evaluation will assess the cost-effectiveness of group arts therapies. A nested process evaluation will consist of treatment fidelity analysis, exploratory analysis of group process measures and qualitative interviews with participants and therapists. DISCUSSION: This will be the first trial to account for patient preferences and diagnostic heterogeneity in group arts therapies. As with all group therapies, there are a number of logistical challenges to which we have had to further adapt due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the study will provide evidence as to whether there is an additive benefit or not to the use of the arts in group therapy in community mental health care.

Interpretation services used for non-English language speaking patients with head and neck cancer: Findings from a tertiary London cancer centre.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment for head and neck cancer (HNC) can lead to profound changes in swallowing function and nutrition. UK HNC standards recommend informational counselling is provided pre-treatment by the dietitian and speech and language therapist (SLT). Non-english speaking patients treated in English speaking countries have poorer treatment outcomes. UK guidance recommends all patients should have access to interpretation services where required. This audit aimed to investigate the language needs and utilisation of interpretation services for patients with HNC attending pre-treatment clinics. METHODS: A retrospective casenote audit over two-years (2021-2023) of all patients attending pre-treatment clinics in a centralised London cancer centre. Information was collected from electronic hospital records on demographics, disease/treatment characteristics, first language; categorised as English primary language (EPL), non-English primary language (NEPL) and interpretation requirements; formal (professional interpreters) or informal (patients friends/relatives). Data was processed and collated using Microsoft Excel (Version 2308). Descriptive statistics were conducted using Excel Analysis ToolPak. RESULTS: 408 patients were included. Most patients were male (67%), aged 61 ± 13 years. 18% (n = 74) had NEPL; 58 required interpretation services. Formal interpretation service was provided in 43% (n = 25), informal services in 33% (n = 19), and no service in 24% (n = 14). Non-adherence to formal services included lack of/inaccurate documentation of language needs, patient preference and lack of available interpreters. CONCLUSION: This audit indicated that barriers exist in utilising formal interpretation services. Future research should investigate how this can be optimised to ensure necessary language support is provided consistent with guidelines that promote equality, diversity, and inclusion.",0
No obvious effect on mortality from a patient choice reform expanding access to opioid disorder treatment - results from a natural experiment of policy change in Sweden.,"BACKGROUND: Opioid-related overdose deaths remain a common cause of death in many settings, and opioid maintenance treatment is evidence-based for the treatment of opioid use disorders. However, access to such treatment varies and is limited in many settings. METHODS: The present study examines the longitudinal effects of a regional patient choice reform which substantially increased availability to opioid maintenance treatment in one Swedish county, starting from 2014. A previous follow-up, limited in time, indicated a possible effect on mortality from this intervention, demonstrating a lower increase in overdose deaths than in counties without this reform. The present study follows overdose deaths through 2021, and compares the intervention county to the remaining parts in the country, using death certificate statistics from the national causes of death register. RESULTS: The present study does not demonstrate any significant difference in the development of overdose mortality in the county where this reform substantially expanded treatment access, compared to other counties in the country. CONCLUSIONS: The study underlines the importance to maintain extensive efforts against overdose deaths over and above the treatment of opioid use disorders, such as low-threshold provision of opioid antidotes or other interventions specifically addressing overdose risk behaviors.",0
Creating space to talk about patients' personal goals: experiences from primary care stakeholders.,"BACKGROUND: To address the many challenges health systems and communities face, primary care is constantly searching for new strategies to improve quality of care. One of the strategies is to focus on patients' personal goals to direct the care process. To adopt an explicit focus on patients' personal goals, actions at different levels are required. As a first step in this process, this study aims to explore the experiences of primary care stakeholders (i.e., scholars, primary care providers, and policy makers) and develop a comprehensive understanding on the idea 'putting patients' goals first'. This will help to formulate suggestions about what these actions should include. METHOD: In this study, 41 primary care stakeholders participating in six focus groups between January 2020 and September 2020, were recruited via maximal variation purposive sampling. Data collection was done through an open-ended semi-structured interview guide. Focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed following a phenomenological-hermeneutical philosophy of Lindseth and Norberg. RESULTS: All participants expressed a strong fundamental belief for putting patients' personal goals first. The primary care providers shared that they created space for patients' personal goals by letting them talk about their values and stories. They reported to integrate their medical expertise with patients' personal goals in order to develop a balanced relationship. In this context, they also talked about the importance of taking into account the perspectives of patients' significant others. Primary care providers also talked about how they used patients' personal goals as a guide in interprofessional collaboration. Scholars denoted that (future) care providers need more training to acquire competencies to discuss patients' personal goals. The providers and policy makers talked about organizational limitations in terms of time restrictions and the lack of registration systems to support a workflow oriented towards patients' personal goals. CONCLUSIONS: This study can be used to support the coherence of the development of different actions and strategies to get primary care stakeholders fully on board to support the adoption of patients' personal goals in care delivery at different levels. However, models of practice and policy plans are needed to work towards a person-centered integrated system.",0
The Influence of Patient Preference on Surgeons' Treatment Recommendations in the Management of Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasms.,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether surgeon variation in management of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) is driven by differences in risk perception and quantify surgeons' risk threshold for changing their recommendations. BACKGROUND: Surgeons vary widely in management of IPMN. METHODS: We conducted a survey of members of the Americas HepatoPancreatoBiliary Association, presented participants with 2 detailed clinical vignettes and asked them to choose between surgical resection and surveillance. We also asked them to judge the likelihood that the IPMN harbors cancer and that the patient would have a serious complication if surgery was performed. Finally, we asked surgeons to rate the level of cancer risk at which they would change their treatment recommendation. We examined the association between surgeons' treatment recommendations and their risk perception and risk threshold. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty surgeons participated in the study. Surgeons varied in their recommendations for surgery [19% for vignette 1 (V1) and 12% for V2] and in their perception of the cancer risk (interquartile range: 2%-10% for V1 and V2) and risk of surgical complications (V1 interquartile range: 10%-20%, V2 20%-30%). After adjusting for surgeon characteristics, surgeons who were above the median in cancer risk perception were 22 percentage points (27% vs. 5%) more likely to recommend resection than those who were below the median (95% CI: 11.34%; P <0.001). The median risk threshold at which surgeons would change their recommendation was 15% (V1 and V2). Surgeons who recommended surgery had a lower risk threshold for changing their recommendation than those who recommended surveillance (V1: 10.0 vs. 15.0, P =0.06; V2: 7.0 vs. 15.0, P =0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The treatment that patients receive for IPMNs depends greatly on how their surgeons perceive the risk of cancer in the lesion. Efforts to improve cancer risk prediction for IPMNs may lead to decreased variations in care.",0
Practice patterns in management of differentiated thyroid cancer since the 2014 British Thyroid Association (BTA) guidelines.,"BACKGROUND: The updated 2014 BTA guidelines emphasised a more conservative, risk adapted model for the management of low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). In comparison to historical approach of total thyroidectomy combined with radioactive iodine, treatment de-escalation is increasingly supported. AIMS: To evaluate the impact of the updated BTA guidelines on the management of DTC cases at regional UK centre. METHODS: All DTC patients were retrospectively identified from regional thyroid MDT database between Jan2009-Dec2020. Oncological treatment and clinico-pathological characteristics were analysed. RESULTS: 623 DTC cases were identified; 312 (247 female: 65 male) between 2009 and 2014 and 311 (225 female: 86 male) between 2015 and 2020. Median age is 48 years (range 16-85). By comparing pre- and post-2015 cohorts, there was a significant drop in total thyroidectomy (87.1% vs 76.8%, p = 0.001) and the use of radioactive iodine (RAI) (73.1% vs 62.1%, p = 0.003) in our post-2015 cohort. When histological adverse features were analysed, extra-thyroidal extension (4.2% vs 17.0%, p=< 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (31.4% vs 50.5%, p=<0.001) and multi-centricity (26.9% vs 43.4%, p = 0.001) were significantly increased in the post 2015 cohort. Nonetheless, total thyroidectomy (TT) remains the treatment choice for low risk T1/2 N0 M0 disease in 65.3% (124/190) in post-2015 cohort for several reasons. Reasons include adverse histological features (50.8%), benign indications (32.5%), contralateral nodules (11.7%), patient preference (2.5%), and diagnostic uncertainty (2.5%). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms a move towards a more conservative approach to patients with low-risk DTC in the UK, which is in keeping with the BTA 2014 guideline and international trends, but total thyroidectomy remains prevalent for low risk T1/2 N0 M0 disease for other reasons.",0
Association between patient choice of provider and patient-reported experience.,"Health providers are striving to create a more positive, patient-centred experience. However, existing scholarly research about the association between determinants of patient choice of provider and patient-reported experience remains insufficient to effectively promote patient-centredness in healthcare systems. This study used a sample from the nationally representative 2020 Healthcare Experience Survey. Among the respondents (n = 12 133), 6809 who used outpatient services were selected for analysis. The variable of interest was the determinant of the patient choice of provider, and the dependent variables were patient-reported experiences (e.g. general satisfaction, experience with doctors, and experience with health providers and nurses). Data were analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model by correcting for covariates. General satisfaction was positively associated with providers' expertise factors and public image factors [providers' expertise factors: odds ratio (OR), 2.96; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.44-3.59; public image factors: OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.02-1.55] satisfied more general satisfaction. Similar results were found for experience with doctors (providers' expertise factors: OR, 4.50; 95% CI, 2.77-7.32; other factors: OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16-0.81) and experience with health providers and nurses (providers' expertise factors: OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.99-3.57; image factors: OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.09-2.14). Our study's findings suggest that to improve patient-reported experience, health providers must better manage providers' expertise factors and public image factors. Health providers can improve patient-reported experience by increasing communication skills and proper information about the nature is important. Moreover, health providers must manage public image factors comprehensively and continuously by maintaining good quality of care and to brand patients.",0
Hartmann's procedure in rectal cancer surgery is often an intraoperative decision: a retrospective multicenter study.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate patient-related factors predicting the selection of rectal cancer patients to Hartmann's procedure as well as to investigate how often, and on what grounds, anterior resection is intraoperatively changed to Hartmann's procedure. METHODS: Prospectively collected data from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry regarding patients with rectal cancer operated upon from January 1 2007 to June 30 2017 in the county of Skåne were retrospectively reviewed. Data were expanded with further details from medical charts. A univariable analysis was performed to investigate variables associated with unplanned HP and significant variables included in a multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Altogether, 1141 patients who underwent Hartmann's procedure (275 patients, 24%), anterior resection (491 patients, 43%), or abdominoperineal resection (375 patients, 33%) were included. Patients undergoing Hartmann's procedure were significantly older and had more frequently comorbidity. The decision to perform Hartmann's procedure was made preoperatively in 209 (76%) patients, most commonly because of a comorbidity (27%) or oncological reasons (25%). Patient preference was noted in 8% of cases. In 64 cases (23%), the decision was made intraoperatively, most often due to anastomotic difficulties (60%) and oncological reasons (22%). Anastomotic difficulties were most often reported due to technical difficulties, a low tumor or neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Male gender was a significant risk factor for undergoing unplanned Hartmann's procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The decision to perform Hartmann's procedure was frequently made intraoperatively. Hartmann's procedure should be considered and discussed preoperatively in old and frail patients, especially in the presence of mid-rectal cancer and/or male gender, since these factors increase the risk of intraoperative anastomotic difficulties.",0
"Two Methods, One Story? Comparing Results of a Choice Experiment and Multidimensional Thresholding From a Clinician Preference Study in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.","OBJECTIVES: An increasing number of methods are used to elicit health preference information. It is unclear whether different elicitation methods produce similar results and policy advice. Here, we compared the results from a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and multidimensional thresholding (MDT) that were conducted in the same sample. METHODS: Clinicians (N = 350) completed a DCE and MDT to elicit their preferences for 4 attributes related to the medical management of subarachnoid hemorrhage after aneurysm repair. Preference weights were compared between the DCE and MDT using a complete combinatorial convolution test. Additionally, data from the DCE and MDT were used to compute preference-based net treatment values for 16 hypothetical treatment profiles versus 1000 simulated comparators. The implied treatment recommendations were compared between the DCE and MDT. RESULTS: Preference weight distributions and median weights did not differ significantly between the DCE and MDT for any attribute: likelihood of delayed cerebral ischemia (medians 0.48 vs 0.40; P = .41), risk of lung complications (medians 0.27 vs 0.30; P = .52), risk of hypotension (medians 0.10 vs 0.11; P = .55), and risk of anemia (medians 0.07 vs 0.07; P = .50). The DCE and MDT produced similar treatment net value distributions (P > .05) and implied the same treatment recommendations in 82.3% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The DCE and MDT elicited similar preference distributions and produced the same treatment recommendations for most tested cases. However, the share of people supporting the average treatment recommendation differed. More research is needed to determine how these findings would compare with those in other populations (in particular, patients) and applications.",0
"Employees' preferences on organisational aspects of psychotherapeutic consultation at work by occupational area, company size, requirement levels and supervisor function - a cross-sectional study in Germany.","BACKGROUND: Common mental disorders affect a significant proportion of the population worldwide at any given time. Psychotherapeutic consultation at work offers employees with mental distress short-term and low-threshold access to psychotherapeutic treatment. However, this offer is only accepted by one to two percent of the employees to whom it is offered. Taking into account employees ' preferences regarding organisational aspects might increase the use of psychotherapeutic consultation at work. This study therefore aimed to identify preferences on organisational aspects of psychotherapeutic consultation at work among employees of diverse occupational areas, company sizes, supervisor functions and job requirement levels. METHODS: A total of 755 employees were recruited via advertisements on social media (Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn). Participants rated on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to different implementation options of psychotherapeutic consultation at work: type (in-person/video/telephone), location (on/outside company premises), time (within/outside working hours), scope (diagnostic/diagnostic + treatment) and purpose (private/occupational). Additionally, the maximum accepted distance to the location of consultation was assessed. Various analyses of variances (ANOVA) were conducted to determine differences in agreement to implementation options within each organisational aspect and to analyse differences between occupational areas, company sizes, requirement levels and between employees with and without supervisor function. RESULTS: Participants indicated a preference for in-person psychotherapeutic consultation that takes places outside company premises and outside working hours. Furthermore, they preferred offers including diagnostic and treatment sessions compared to offers including diagnostic sessions only. Even though participants agreed that consultation should be offered for all purposes, agreement for occupational issues was stronger than for private issues. For some implementation options, the level of agreement varied according to occupational field, company size, supervisor function and level of requirement. However, these differences did not affect the key findings mentioned above. CONCLUSION: Those findings give practical indications on the organisational design of psychotherapeutic consultation at work. The results suggest that in-person consultation outside company premises and working hours combining diagnostic and treatment sessions will be accepted by employees regardless of their occupational area, company size, supervisor function and requirement level.",0
Comparison of a full and partial choice set design in a labeled discrete choice experiment.,"Labeled discrete choice experiments (DCEs) commonly present all alternatives using a full choice set design (FCSD), which could impose a high cognitive burden on respondents. In the setting of employment preferences, this study explored if a partial choice set design (PCSD) reduced cognitive burden whilst maintaining convergent validity compared with a FCSD. Respondents' preferences between the two designs were investigated. In the experimental design, labeled utility functions were rewritten into a single generic utility function using label dummy variables to generate an efficient PCSD with 3 alternatives shown in each choice task (out of 6). The DCE was embedded in a nationwide survey of 790 Australian pharmacy degree holders where respondents were presented with both a block of FCSD and PCSD tasks in random order. The PCSD's impact on error variances was investigated using a heteroscedastic conditional logit model. The convergent validity of PCSD was based on the equality of willingness-to-forgo-expected-salary estimates from Willingness-to-pay-space mixed logit models. A nested logit model was used combined with respondents' qualitative responses to understand respondents' design preferences. We show a promising future use of PCSD by providing evidence that PCSD can reduce cognitive burden while satisfying convergent validity compared to FCSD.",1
Assessing Stakeholder Engagement for Outcomes-Based Research Among Patients With Chronic Rhinosinusitis and Asthma: A Survey-Based Investigation.,"BACKGROUND: Despite significant morbidity, there remains a critical need for prospective analyses to investigate the impact of comorbid chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with asthma (CRSwA) on patient centered outcomes. The objective of this study was to ascertain critical stakeholder feedback from patients that could inform future study design based on patient preferences, in an effort to optimize patient enrollment. METHODS: A prospective, descriptive study was performed in order to determine the importance of various factors on CRSwA treatment among critical stakeholders. A Likert-scale survey highlighting various aspects of treatment of CRSwA and elucidating patient enthusiasm for clinical enrollment was constructed and prospectively administered to patients with CRSwA. A univariate analysis was instituted to understand the significance of the different trial design preferences. RESULTS: Survey responses were collected from a total of 17 patients with CRSwA. With Likert scores >4/5, responses indicated significant stakeholder interest in research focused on understanding symptom triggers, including the impact of air quality and allergens. Importantly, the highest mean scores noted were for studies focused on improving (1) overall quality of life (4.8/5) and (2) lung function (4.8/5). Patients appeared least interested in participation in a randomized trial, whereas the greatest support was communicated for a purely observational trial (P = .08). CONCLUSION: Patients with CRSwA demonstrate enthusiasm for participation in research that focuses on improving patient centered outcomes-specifically quality of life and lung function. Stakeholder feedback also indicates a preference for observational study design over randomized control trials.",0
"A cross-sectional study on factors influencing patient participation in undergraduate medical education in a public and private hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa.","BACKGROUND: The active involvement of patients in medical education is a common practice globally. Despite this, there is a global paucity of data on patients' views on their role in medical education. As such this study aimed to identify factors that influence patient participation in undergraduate medical education in public and private hospitals in Johannesburg. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted, using a 23-question, self-designed, paper questionnaire to collect data on patients' perceptions of student involvement in their care - with regard to consent, confidentiality, ethics, and patient preferences. Participants were recruited on a voluntary basis in the Departments of Medicine, Surgery, and Gynaecology, at selected hospital sites. Fisher's Exact and Chi-Square statistical tests were used where appropriate. RESULTS: Two hundred and one adult patients, comprised of 150 public sector patients and 51 private sector patients, completed the questionnaire. One hundred and sixty-nine patients (84,1%) were willing to participate in undergraduate medical education and no notable difference between these sectors was demonstrated (p = 0,41). The results further demonstrated that the main factors influencing patient participation in undergraduate medical education across both sectors were (1) the presence of a supervising professional, (2) the perceived degree of invasiveness of a procedure, and (3) the perceived expertise of the student. In addition, data across other key themes such as consent, confidentiality, ethics, and patient preferences and perceptions were elucidated. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the majority of inpatients across the public and private sectors are willing to participate in undergraduate medical education to facilitate the development of healthcare professionals. It also demonstrated that most patients have a positive experience. However, more measures of quality informed consent need to be instituted to optimise the current role of the South African public health sector, whilst facilitating the development of a similar role for the South African private sector in future clinical education. In addition, further research is necessary to evaluate these findings in a South African context.",0
Comparative efficacy of treatments for molluscum contagiosum: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Various interventions have been applied to treat molluscum contagiosum, but benefits and efficacy remain unclear. To assess the comparative efficacy and safety of interventions for molluscum contagiosum, a network meta-analysis was performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library were searched for articles published between January 1, 1990, and November 31, 2020. Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of interventions in immunocompetent children and adults with genital/non-genital molluscum contagiosum lesions. RESULTS: Twelve interventions from 25 RCTs including 2,123 participants were assessed. Compared with the placebo, ingenol mebutate had the most significant effect on complete clearance (odds ratio [OR] 117.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.37-2164.88), followed by cryotherapy (OR 16.81, 95% CI 4.13-68.54), podophyllotoxin (OR 10.24, 95% CI 3.36-31.21), and potassium hydroxide (KOH) (OR 10.02, 95% CI 4.64-21.64). Data on adverse effects were too scarce for quantitative synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Ingenol mebutate, cryotherapy, podophyllotoxin, and KOH were more effective than the other interventions in achieving complete clearance, but safety concerns regarding ingenol mebutate have recently been reported. Due to the possibility of spontaneous resolution, observation is also justified for asymptomatic infection. Factors including adverse effects, cost, patient preference, and medical accessibility should be considered.",0
Exercise Preferences in Young Adults with Cancer-The YOUEX Study.,"(1) Background: Strong evidence supports the persuasive positive effects of exercise for cancer patients and survivors. Different approaches of exercise programs have been established; however, the special interests of young adults (YAs) with cancer have rarely been considered in exercise interventions. Therefore, the study YOUng EXercisers (YOUEX) aimed to investigate exercise preferences in YAs. (2) Methods: YOUEX was a three-arm, patient preference-based non-randomized, longitudinal, pre-post exercise intervention, offering three different exercise modules to YAs during or after acute therapy (Module 1: online supervised group-based (M1); Module 2: online unsupervised (M2); Module 3: in-person supervised (M3)). The intervention period was 12 weeks with another 12-week follow-up period, the modules could be changed or amended after 6 and 12 weeks. (3) Results: 92 YAs were allocated to the study. At baseline, 50 YAs (54%) chose M2, 32 YAs (35%) M1 and 10 YAs (11%) M3. The analysis revealed high acceptability and feasibility of the online exercise programs (M1, M2). There was a high impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the execution of M3. YAs showed diverse preferences in module selection due to differences in, e.g., cancer therapy status or favored level of supervision. (4) Conclusions: YAs need personalized exercise programs that consider their individual interests and needs. Online exercise programs can be a promising addition to existing exercise opportunities. They are an effective way to increase physical activity levels in YAs.",0
Patients' acceptance of a shared cancer follow-up model of care between general practitioners and radiation oncologists: A population-based survey using the theoretical Framework of Acceptability.,"INTRODUCTION: International and national guidelines highlight the need for general practitioner involvement during and after active cancer treatment and throughout long-term follow-up care. This paper aimed to evaluate patients' acceptance of radiation oncology shared follow-up care using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA). METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at two cancer care centres in the Illawarra Shoalhaven region of Australia. A sample of patients scheduled for a radiation oncology follow-up consultation in 2021 were sent a 32-point self-complete paper-based survey. Data were analysed using descriptive, parametric and non-parametric statistical analysis. This paper followed the Checklist for Reporting of Survey Studies (CROSS). RESULTS: Of the 414 surveys returned (45% response rate), the acceptance for radiation oncology shared cancer follow-up care was high (80%). Patients treated with only radiotherapy were 1.7 times more likely to accept shared follow-up care than those treated with multiple modalities. Patients who preferred follow-up care for fewer than three years were 7.5 times more likely to accept shared care than those who preferred follow-up care for five years. Patients who travelled more than 20 minutes to their radiation oncologist or to the rural cancer centre were slightly more likely to accept shared care than those who travelled less than twenty minutes to the regional cancer centre. A high understanding of shared care (Intervention Coherence) and a positive feeling towards shared care (Affective Attitude) were significant predictive factors in accepting shared radiation oncology follow-up care. CONCLUSION: Health services need to ensure patient preferences are considered to provide patient-centred cancer follow-up care. Shared cancer follow-up care implementation should start with patients who prefer a shorter follow-up period and understand the benefits of shared care. However, patients' involvement needs to be considered alongside other clinical risk profiles and organisational factors. Future qualitative research using the TFA constructs is warranted to inform clinical practice change.",0
Linear versus Turbulent Airflow Tracheostomy Heat and Moisture Exchangers: A Crossover Study.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of two tracheostomy heat and moisture exchangers (HMEs), namely the Shikani Oxygen HME™ (S-O(2) HME, ball type, turbulent airflow) and Mallinckrodt Tracheolife II DAR HME (M-O(2) HME; flapper type, linear airflow) on tracheobronchial mucosal health, oxygenation, humidification, and patient preference. METHODS: A randomized cross-over study was conducted with HME-naïve long-term tracheostomy subjects at two academic medical centers. Bronchoscopy assessments of mucosal health were performed at baseline and day 5 of HME application, along with oxygen saturation (S(pO2) ) and breathed air humidity at four oxygen flow rates (1, 2, 3, and 5 lpm). Patient preference was assessed on study conclusion. RESULTS: Both HMEs were associated with improved mucosal inflammation and decreased mucus production (p < 0.0002), with greater improvements in the S-O(2) HME group (p < 0.007). Both HMEs improved humidity concentration at each oxygen flow rate (p < 0.0001), without significant differences between groups. S(pO2) was greater for the S-O(2) HME versus the M-O(2) HME across all measured oxygen flow rates (p = 0.003). At low oxygen flow rates (1 or 2 lpm), the S(pO2) in the S-O(2) HME group was similar to that of the M-O(2) HME at higher oxygen flow rates (3 or 5 lpm; p = 0.6). Ninety percent of subjects preferred the S-O(2) HME. CONCLUSION: Tracheostomy HME uses correlated with improved indicators of tracheobronchial mucosal health, humidity, and oxygenation. The S-O(2) HME outperformed the M-O(2) HME with respect to tracheobronchial inflammation, S(pO2) , and patient preference. Regular HME use by tracheostomy patients is recommended to optimize pulmonary health. Newer ball-type speaking valve technology additionally allows concomitant HME and speaking valve application. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Laryngoscope, 133:3422-3428, 2023.",0
"""It's Important to Work with People that Look Like Me"": Black Patients' Preferences for Patient-Provider Race Concordance.","A compelling body of research supports the race concordance hypothesis, which asserts that racially minoritized patients who share the same race and ethnicity with their provider have improved communication, better perceptions of care, and better health outcomes. Using a mixed methods approach, this study examined (1) the association between racial identity and patients' preference for race-concordant patient-provider dyads and (2) Black patients' subjective experiences of race concordance. Data were gathered from 47 Black caregivers who completed both a survey and participated in a focus group. Quantitative analyses revealed that the majority (83%) of caregivers reported that it is important to have a mental health provider of the same race and ethnicity. Greater racial centrality, but not private or public regard, was associated with a stronger race concordance preference. Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed six themes related to race-concordant preferences: aspects related to the patient care experience, cultural humility, relatability, diversity in cultural experiences, role models for children, and intersecting identities. Patients with a race concordance preference felt more comfortable with their provider, perceived that it was easier to build a rapport with their provider, and emphasized the value of representation for themselves and their children. Patients who were neutral in their race concordance preference emphasized professionalism over race, valued diverse perspectives, and appreciated their providers' cultural awareness and willingness to self-educate. The integration of these findings will help to elucidate a more nuanced understanding of the factors that build the therapeutic relationship and cultivate a framework of comfort and understanding in the clinical setting.",0
Women's perceptions of body mass graphics and their preferences for weight counselling.,"Health care providers may lack data-driven guidance about best practises for discussing weight. We assessed women's self-perception of body mass index (BMI) and preferences for weight counselling by provider characteristics and the initiating question. A voluntary, anonymous survey was completed by 756 women (age ≥ 19 year) at our tertiary care obstetrics and gynaecology clinics in autumn 2021. The respondents' height and weight were collected before respondents selected graphics from a validated Body Image Scale that they felt best represented their current body size and which graphs should prompt weight loss or gain recommendations. Respondents were asked their preferences about provider characteristics for discussion about weight and to identify which of six initiating questions from a provider was most and least preferred. Blank responses were allowed. In 708 responses, 366 women (52%) selected the most accurate graphic that corresponded to their BMI; the selected graphic represented a lower than actual BMI in 268 women (38%) and higher in 74 women (10%). In 648 responses, 374 women (58%) preferred a female provider, but provider body shape, ethnicity/race and age were not important to most women. The most preferred question to initiate a discussion about weight was ""A lot of women have trouble achieving or maintaining a healthy weight; is that something we can discuss?"" in 181 of 555 women (33%), and the least preferred question was ""Do you feel like you are at an appropriate weight?"" in 172 of 554 women (31%). Provider knowledge about patient preferences regarding questions may facilitate the discussion about weight.",0
Differences between physician and patient preferences for cancer treatments: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making is useful to facilitate cancer treatment decisions. However, it is difficult to make treatment decisions when physician and patient preferences are different. This review aimed to summarize and compare the preferences for cancer treatments between physicians and patients. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Scopus. Studies elicited and compared preferences for cancer treatments between physicians and patients were included. Information about the study design and preference measuring attributes or questions were extracted. The available relative rank of every attribute in discrete choice experiment (DCE) studies and answers to preference measuring questions in non-DCE studies were summarized followed by a narrative synthesis to reflect the preference differences. RESULTS: Of 12,959 studies identified, 8290 were included in the title and abstract screening and 48 were included in the full text screening. Included 37 studies measured the preferences from six treatment-related aspects: health benefit, adverse effects, treatment process, cost, impact on quality of life, and provider qualification. The trade-off between health benefit and adverse effects was the main focus of the included studies. DCE studies showed patients gave a higher rank on health benefit and treatment process, while physicians gave a higher rank on adverse effects. Non-DCE studies suggested that patients were willing to take a higher risk of adverse effects or lower health benefit than physicians when accepting a treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians and patients had important preference differences for cancer treatment. More sufficient communication is needed in cancer treatment decision-making.",1
Patient-Centered Clinical Trial Design for Heart Failure Devices via Bayesian Decision Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: The statistical significance of clinical trial outcomes is generally interpreted quantitatively according to the same threshold of 2.5% (in one-sided tests) to control the false-positive rate or type I error, regardless of the burden of disease or patient preferences. The clinical significance of trial outcomes-including patient preferences-are also considered, but through qualitative means that may be challenging to reconcile with the statistical evidence. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to apply Bayesian decision analysis to heart failure device studies to choose an optimal significance threshold that maximizes the expected utility to patients across both the null and alternative hypotheses, thereby allowing clinical significance to be incorporated into statistical decisions either in the trial design stage or in the post-trial interpretation stage. In this context, utility is a measure of how much well-being the approval decision for the treatment provides to the patient. METHODS: We use the results from a discrete-choice experiment study focusing on heart failure patients' preferences, questioning respondents about their willingness to accept therapeutic risks in exchange for quantifiable benefits with alternative hypothetical medical device performance characteristics. These benefit-risk trade-off data allow us to estimate the loss in utility-from the patient perspective-of a false-positive or false-negative pivotal trial result. We compute the Bayesian decision analysis-optimal statistical significance threshold that maximizes the expected utility to heart failure patients for a hypothetical two-arm, fixed-sample, randomized controlled trial. An interactive Excel-based tool is provided that illustrates how the optimal statistical significance threshold changes as a function of patients' preferences for varying rates of false positives and false negatives, and as a function of assumed key parameters. RESULTS: In our baseline analysis, the Bayesian decision analysis-optimal significance threshold for a hypothetical two-arm randomized controlled trial with a fixed sample size of 600 patients per arm was 3.2%, with a statistical power of 83.2%. This result reflects the willingness of heart failure patients to bear additional risks of the investigational device in exchange for its probable benefits. However, for increased device-associated risks and for risk-averse subclasses of heart failure patients, Bayesian decision analysis-optimal significance thresholds may be smaller than 2.5%. CONCLUSIONS: A Bayesian decision analysis is a systematic, transparent, and repeatable process for combining clinical and statistical significance, explicitly incorporating burden of disease and patient preferences into the regulatory decision-making process.",1

Sleep Disorders and Aging in Women.,"Women of advancing age can suffer from an array of sleep disorders. We review the changes in sleep architecture, the impact of hormonal changes on sleep, and the various sleep disorders in women of advancing age. A focused history in this population should include the temporal relation to menopause and comorbid conditions. Treatment options should involve patient preference and review of current medications and comorbid conditions to optimize sleep in this population.",0
Addressing Patient Requests to Add Dietary Supplements to Their Cancer Care-A Suggested Approach.,"Dietary supplements are widely utilized by cancer patients as part of a complementary and integrative approach to their healthcare. However, a significant portion of patients refrain from discussing their supplement use with their physicians, often due to the perceived indifference or negativity of their healthcare providers. This communication gap exposes patients to unreliable information sources and potential risks associated with uninformed supplementation. As the healthcare landscape evolves, there is an increasing recognition of the pivotal role that physicians play in guiding patients' healthcare decisions. A patient-centered perspective prioritizes the provision of evidence-based information tailored to the individual's needs. It advocates for open discussions about potential risks and fosters shared decision making, respecting patient autonomy. Additionally, this approach involves offering alternative options, documenting patient preferences, and ensuring ongoing support while coordinating with the healthcare team. To address these evolving needs, healthcare providers must adopt a transformative perspective, becoming expert guides who engage with their patients as informed and empowered participants. This revised approach emphasizes an open dialogue that balances presenting facts and acknowledging uncertainties surrounding dietary supplement use. Our narrative review of the literature underscores the importance of a practical approach, centered on transparent discussions and respect for patient autonomy. By following this approach, healthcare providers can empower patients to navigate the complexities of dietary supplement use within the context of cancer care, thereby safeguarding patient safety and overall well-being. Notably, our proposed tool highlights the utilization of reliable sources, the risk stratification of supplements, specific recommendations, and subsequent monitoring, providing a structured framework for informed decision making.",0
Quantitative Benefit-Risk Assessment in Medical Product Decision Making: A Good Practices Report of an ISPOR Task Force.,"Benefit-risk assessment is commonly conducted by drug and medical device developers and regulators, to evaluate and communicate issues around benefit-risk balance of medical products. Quantitative benefit-risk assessment (qBRA) is a set of techniques that incorporate explicit outcome weighting within a formal analysis to evaluate the benefit-risk balance. This report describes emerging good practices for the 5 main steps of developing qBRAs based on the multicriteria decision analysis process. First, research question formulation needs to identify the needs of decision makers and requirements for preference data and specify the role of external experts. Second, the formal analysis model should be developed by selecting benefit and safety endpoints while eliminating double counting and considering attribute value dependence. Third, preference elicitation method needs to be chosen, attributes framed appropriately within the elicitation instrument, and quality of the data should be evaluated. Fourth, analysis may need to normalize the preference weights, base-case and sensitivity analyses should be conducted, and the effect of preference heterogeneity analyzed. Finally, results should be communicated efficiently to decision makers and other stakeholders. In addition to detailed recommendations, we provide a checklist for reporting qBRAs developed through a Delphi process conducted with 34 experts.",1
Comparative effectiveness of ice packs versus topical lidocaine-prilocaine mixture for pain control in laser hair removal of the axilla: A rater-blinded randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Laser hair removal is associated with moderate acute pain. OBJECTIVE: To compare effectiveness of ice pack to topical lidocaine-prilocaine for pain reduction during axillary laser hair removal. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive topical anesthetic to one axilla and ice packs to the other before each of 3, monthly 810 nm diode laser sessions. The primary endpoint was participant-reported pain on the visual analog scale (VAS) immediately following and 5 minutes after laser session. Posttreatment erythema, overall edema, and perifollicular edema were assessed by 2 blinded photoraters. Skin temperatures, patient preferences, and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: Eighty-eight of 90 (98%) planned laser treatments were delivered and randomized. Participants reported higher VAS scores immediately after laser treatment with lidocaine-prilocaine compared to ice (P = .03). Five minutes after, participants reported higher VAS scores with ice (P = .03). After 53 of the 88 treatments (60.2%), participants reported preferring ice (P = .055). No serious adverse events were reported. LIMITATIONS: All participants were Caucasian or Asian with Fitzpatrick skin type I to III and coarse dark axillary hair, which may limit generalizability. CONCLUSIONS: While pain control with ice and topical anesthesia is associated with time after treatment, the 2 modalities do not differ in terms of degree of pain reduction associated with axillary laser hair removal.",0
Mothers' and birthing parents' experiences with 1-day cognitive behavioural therapy-based workshops for postpartum depression: A descriptive qualitative study.,"WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE SUBJECT?: One in five mothers and birthing parents are affected by postpartum depression (PPD), yet only a small proportion of those with PPD receive treatment. Given cost and accessibility barriers to treatment, brief therapies (e.g. 1 day) could help address PPD on a large scale, though understanding participants' unique experiences with this novel treatment will help guide its refinement and use. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: This paper describes the experiences, perspectives and satisfaction of participants who attended a 1-day workshop for PPD. Participants appreciate being taught practical techniques and the receipt of social support from facilitators and other attendees in the group setting, while some recommended further 'booster sessions' to enhance effectiveness. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: One-day CBT-based workshops may be an effective, low-intensity treatment option that provides helpful skills and builds social networks for individuals with PPD. Additional post-workshop booster sessions may enhance participant satisfaction with this new treatment by providing a reinforcement of their learning and an opportunity to re-connect with other birthing parents. ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Postpartum depression (PPD) affects up to one in five mothers and birthing parents. Understanding their perceptions of therapeutic interventions is key to their effectiveness and scalability. AIM: The aim of the study was to understand participants' experiences attending an in-person or online 1-day cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based workshop for PPD and compare their experiences participating in either modality. METHOD: This descriptive qualitative study was embedded in two separate randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of 1-day CBT-based workshops for PPD delivered in-person or online. Responses were provided by 94 in-person and 95 online participants about their experiences. Content analysis was used to code and categorize the data. RESULTS: Participants appreciated learning skills to improve PPD symptoms and joining a community of individuals with shared experiences. Integrating practical coping techniques after the workshop was reported to be most useful, though some wanted additional post-workshop support. Online participants identified additional barriers to workshop engagement. DISCUSSION: Participants who attended either workshop found them to be valuable and effective. Participants valued psychoeducation, social connections and applying practical CBT techniques. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: One-day CBT-based workshops may be an accessible treatment option for individuals with PPD, providing new skills and social support, though some prefer to receive additional post-workshop support.",0
Patient Preferences for Pharmacy Services: A Systematic Review of Studies Based on Discrete Choice Experiments.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In recent years, the mission of pharmacists has evolved and the model of the caregiver-patient relationship has been challenged by a new patient-centered approach. A challenge to providing personalized care is the assessment of patient preferences. We aimed to systematically identify published discrete choice experiments related to patient preferences for pharmacy services and to assess the quality of the selected articles. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted in two databases (PubMed and Embase, until March 2023) according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. The quality of the selected articles was assessed according to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research conjoint analysis checklist. RESULTS: Among the 421 articles identified, 16 published studies were included and analyzed. They were mostly published in pharmaceutical (n = 6), economic (n = 4), and public health (n = 4) journals. Only two articles concerned the field of hospital pharmacy. Only five presented the specific pharmacy service studied: filling of prescriptions, management of symptoms, treatment delivery, and components of pharmacist counseling. Five articles focused on pharmacy services related to a specific disease. None fully fulfilled the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research checklist, only partially fulfilled. CONCLUSIONS: According to the identified studies, cost, time, logistics (organizational criteria), and pharmacists' courtesy and skills were consistently cited as factors influencing patient preferences for pharmacy services. The disclosure of patient preferences is a complex and under-researched topic, especially in the field of pharmacy, but interest is growing. As the mission of pharmacists evolves to bring them closer to patients, the better understanding of patient preferences in pharmacy services will allow for better targeting and better integration of patient profiles in patient management.",1
Exploring Patient Adherence to Post-Surgical Follow-Up in Pelvic Endometriosis.,"Endometriosis is a significant cause of disability that affects 5-10% of reproductive-aged women. Laparoscopy with histological confirmation is the gold standard in establishing the diagnosis as therapeutic management surgery is addressed to a certain category of patients. The objective of this study was to assess patient adherence to follow-up after surgery for endometriosis as the primary endpoint, pain symptoms, quality of life, mental health, and fertility as the secondary endpoints. We have analyzed patients' adherence to follow-up after surgery for endometriosis after 1, 3, 5, and 7 years. Out of the 2538 total number of surgeries, 453 patients replied just to the first questionnaire (group A), 528 to the first and second (group B), and only 356 carried out the entire follow-up schedule. General health was significantly lower for group A (46.6 vs. 56.4) but with no statistical difference in the post-surgical improvement in both groups. Pain level score improvement was lower for group A (10.5 vs. 18.8), which is statistically significant. In this light, laparoscopy still remains the gold standard in diagnosis only. Furthermore, no malignancy was discovered. The mental component was improved by laparoscopy based on SF-36 in group B. Studies on patient preference for surgery versus alternative treatment are needed.",0
Adherence to evidence-based implementation of antimicrobial treatment guidelines among prescribers in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Adherence to evidence-based standard treatment guidelines (STGs) enable healthcare providers to deliver consistently appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Irrational use of antimicrobials significantly contributes to antimicrobial resistance in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).  The best available evidence is needed to guide healthcare providers on adherence to evidence-based implementation of STGs. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of adherence to evidence-based implementation of antimicrobial treatment guidelines among prescribers in SSA. METHODS: The review followed the JBI methodology for systematic reviews of prevalence data. CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched with no language and publication year limitations. STATA version 17 were used for meta-analysis. The publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed using Egger's test and the I(2) statistics. Heterogeneity and publication bias were validated using Duval and Tweedie's nonparametric trim and fill analysis using the random-effect analysis. The summary prevalence and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of healthcare professionals' compliance with evidence-based implementation of STG were estimated using random effect model. The review protocol has been registered with PROSPERO code CRD42023389011. The PRISMA flow diagram and checklist were used to report studies included, excluded and their corresponding section in the manuscript. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies with a total of 17,017 study participants from 14 countries in sub-Saharan Africa were included. The pooled prevalence of adherence to evidence-based implementation of antimicrobial treatment guidelines in SSA were 45%. The pooled prevalence of the most common clinical indications were respiratory tract (35%) and gastrointestinal infections (18%). Overall prescriptions per wards were inpatients (14,413) and outpatients (12,845). Only 391 prescribers accessed standard treatment guidelines during prescription of antimicrobials. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals' adherence to evidence-based implementation of STG for antimicrobial treatment were low in SSA. Healthcare systems in SSA must make concerted efforts to enhance prescribers access to STGs through optimization of mobile clinical decision support applications. Innovative, informative, and interactive strategies must be in place by the healthcare systems in SSA to empower healthcare providers to make evidence-based clinical decisions informed by the best available evidence and patient preferences, to ultimately improving patient outcomes and promoting appropriate antimicrobial use.",0
Treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism in patients under palliative care.,"Many patients with cancer require palliative care at some stage and the vast majority of people followed in palliative care are cancer patients. Patients with cancer are at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and this is particularly true during the advanced palliative phase when mobility is limited or absent. Patients with cancer in palliative cancer are at higher bleeding risk compared to non-cancer patients. Decisions to treat VTE or withhold anticoagulation for these patients have proven to be difficult and depend largely on an individual clinician's judgment. For this reason, we have developed a consensus proposal for appropriate management of cancer-associated thromboembolism (CAT) in patients in palliative care, which is presented in this article. The proposal was informed by the recent scientific literature retrieved through a systematic literature review. In cancer patients in advanced palliative care, the benefit-risk ratio of anticoagulation seems unfavourable with a higher haemorrhagic risk than the benefit associated with prevention of CAT recurrence and, above all, in the absence of any benefit on quality of life. For this reason, we recommend that patients should be prescribed anticoagulants on a case-by-case basis. The choice of whether to treat, and with which type of treatment, should take into account anticipated life expectancy and patient preferences, as well as clinical factors such as the estimated bleeding risk, the type of VTE experienced and the time since the VTE event.",0
Treatment patterns and outcomes among adults with immune thrombocytopenia receiving pharmaceutical second-line therapies: a retrospective cohort study using administrative claims data.,"OBJECTIVES: To describe and compare real-world treatment patterns and clinical outcomes among individuals with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) receiving second-line therapies (rituximab, romiplostim, or eltrombopag). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a large administrative claims database (January 2013-May 2020) among continuously enrolled patients ≥18 years prescribed second-line ITP therapies. The index date was the date of the first claim of the study medications. Treatment patterns and outcomes were measured during the 12-month follow-up period. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to balance covariates across treatment groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare treatment patterns and bleeding risk outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 695 patients were included (rituximab, N = 285; romiplostim, N = 212; eltrombopag, N = 198). After IPTW, all baseline covariates were balanced. Compared to eltrombopag, patients in the rituximab cohort were 57% more likely to receive other ITP therapies (systematic corticosteroids or third-line therapies) during the follow-up period (odds ratio [OR] = 1.571, p = .030). There was no significant difference in the odds of receiving a different second-line therapy or experiencing a bleeding-related episode among three groups (p > .050). Patients in the romiplostim cohort were 69% more likely to receive rescue therapy compared to those in the rituximab cohort (OR = 1.688, p = .025). CONCLUSION: Patients with ITP receiving rituximab were more likely to need other ITP therapies but did not experience higher risk of bleeding compared to those receiving eltrombopag or romiplostim. Benefits, risks, cost-effectiveness, and patient preference should all be considered in optimizing second-line therapy for ITP.",0
Self-administered stretching exercises are as effective as motor control exercises for people with chronic non-specific low back pain: a randomised trial.,"QUESTION: In people with chronic non-specific low back pain, what is the effect of self-administered stretching exercises relative to motor control exercises on pain intensity, disability, fear avoidance, global perceived effect and flexibility? DESIGN: Randomised trial with concealed allocation, intention-to-treat analysis and blinding of assessors. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred people with chronic non-specific low back pain. INTERVENTIONS: The self-stretching exercise group performed 6 stretches in 40-minute sessions. The motor control exercise group performed trunk stabilising exercises in 40-minute sessions. Both groups performed weekly supervised sessions for 8 weeks with one or more home sessions/week. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were pain intensity (0 to 10 scale) and disability (Oswestry Disability Index). The secondary outcomes were the Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, global perceived effect, and the fingertip-to-floor test. Measures were taken at baseline and at 8, 13 and 26 weeks. RESULTS: On the 0 to 10 scale, the between-group difference in pain intensity was negligible, with a mean difference of roughly 0 (95% CI -1 to 1) at each time point. Similarly, the between-group difference on the 100-point disability scale was negligible: MD -1 (95% CI -3 to 1) at week 8, MD 1 (95% CI -1 to 3) at week 13 and MD 0 (95% CI -1 to 2) at week 26. The two interventions also had similar effects on the secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: In people with chronic non-specific low back pain, self-stretching exercises had very similar effects to motor control exercises on pain intensity, disability, fear avoidance, global perceived effect and flexibility up to 18 weeks beyond the end of an 8-week program. Given the established effectiveness of motor control exercises, either intervention could be recommended to people with chronic low back pain. The choice of intervention might be directed by patient preference. REGISTRATION: NCT03128801.",0
QALY-type preference and willingness-to-pay among end-of-life patients with cancer treatments: a pilot study using discrete choice experiment.,"PURPOSE: Quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a dominant measurement of health gain in economic evaluations for pricing drugs. However, end-of-life (EoL) patients' preference for QALY gains in life expectancy (LE) and quality of life (QoL) during different disease stages remains unknown and is seldom involved in decision-making. This study aims to measure preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) towards different types of QALY gain among EoL cancer patients. METHODS: We attributed QALY gain to four types, gain in LE and QoL, respectively, and during both progression-free survival (PFS) and post-progression survival (PPS). A discrete choice experiment including five attributes (the four QALY attributes and one cost attribute) with three levels each was developed and conducted with 85 Chinese advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients in 2022. All levels were set with QALY gain/cost synthesised from research on anti-lung cancer drugs recently listed by Chinese National Healthcare Security Administration. Each respondent answered six choice tasks in a face-to-face interview. The data were analysed using mixed logit models. RESULTS: Patients valued LE-related QALY gain in PFS most, with a relative importance of 81.8% and a WTP of $43,160 [95% CI 26,751 ~ 59,569] per QALY gain. Respondents consistently preferred LE-related to QoL-related QALY gain regardless of disease stage. Patients with higher income or lower education levels tended to pay more for QoL-related QALY gain. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a prioritised resource allocation to EoL-prolonging health technologies. Given the small sample size and large individual heterogeneity, a full-scale study is needed to provide more robust results.",1
MK-0616: an oral PCSK9 inhibitor for hypercholesterolemia treatment.,"INTRODUCTION: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lowering LDL-cholesterol, by lifestyle modification or therapeutically, reduces the risk of ASCVD. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a protein which binds to the LDL-receptor and induces degradation, is a clinically validated target to lower LDL-cholesterol. Injectable PCSK9 inhibitor therapies have demonstrated substantial reductions in LDL-cholesterol with associated decreased risk of ASCVD events. AREAS COVERED: MK-0616 is an orally bioavailable, renally excreted, macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of PCSK9. The article provides an understanding of the chemistry and development, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of MK-0616 and insight into its clinical efficacy and safety. In clinical trials, MK-0616 produced dose-dependent reductions in LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein (apo) B levels. Furthermore, MK-0616 modestly lowered lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)]. EXPERT OPINION: MK-0616 is a potent, oral macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of PCSK9 that is not only able to reduce LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol, and apoB, but can also lower Lp(a). Safety and tolerability studies reported to date are promising. MK-0616 may offer advantages over injectable anti-PCSK9 therapies in terms of ease of dosing, patient preference and cost. The results from phase III trials of MK-0616 on cardiovascular outcomes are awaited with interest.",0
Patient Preferences for Postmastectomy Breast Reconstruction.,"IMPORTANCE: Up to 40% of women experience dissatisfaction after breast reconstruction due to unexpected outcomes that are poorly aligned with personal preferences. Identifying what attributes patients value when considering surgery could improve shared decision-making. Adaptive choice-based conjoint (ACBC) analysis can elicit individual-level treatment preferences. OBJECTIVES: To identify which attributes of breast reconstruction are most important to women considering surgery and to describe how these attributes differ by those who prefer flap vs implant reconstruction. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from March 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023, at Duke University and between June 1 and December 31, 2022, through the Love Research Army with ACBC analysis. Participants were 105 women at Duke University with a new diagnosis of or genetic predisposition to breast cancer who were considering mastectomy with reconstruction and 301 women with a history of breast cancer or a genetic predisposition as identified through the Love Research Army registry. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Relative importance scores, part-worth utility values, and maximum acceptable risks were estimated. RESULTS: Overall, 406 women (105 from Duke University [mean (SD) age, 46.3 (10.5) years] and 301 from the Love Research Army registry [mean (SD) age, 59.2 (11.9) years]) participated. The attribute considered most important was the risk of abdominal morbidity (mean [SD] relative importance [RI], 28% [11%]), followed by chance of major complications (RI, 25% [10%]), number of additional operations (RI, 23% [12%]), appearance of the breasts (RI, 13% [12%]), and recovery time (RI, 11% [7%]). Most participants (344 [85%]) preferred implant-based reconstruction; these participants cared most about abdominal morbidity (mean [SD] RI, 30% [11%]), followed by the risk of complications (mean [SD], RI, 26% [11%]) and additional operations (mean [SD] RI, 21% [12%]). In contrast, participants who preferred flap reconstruction cared most about additional operations (mean [SD] RI, 31% [15%]), appearance of the breasts (mean [SD] RI, 27% [16%]), and risk of complications (mean [SD] RI, 18% [6%]). Factors independently associated with choosing flap reconstruction included being married (odds ratio [OR], 2.30 [95% CI, 1.04-5.08]; P = .04) and higher educational level (college education; OR, 2.43 [95% CI, 1.01-5.86]; P = .048), while having an income level of greater than $75 000 was associated with a decreased likelihood of choosing the flap profile (OR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.21-0.97]; P = .01). Respondents who preferred flap appearance were willing to accept a mean (SD) increase of 14.9% (2.2%) chance of abdominal morbidity (n = 113) or 6.4% (4.8%) chance of complications (n = 115). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides information on how women value different aspects of their care when making decisions for breast reconstruction. Future studies should assess how decision aids that elicit individual-level preferences can help tailor patient-physician discussions to focus preoperative counseling on factors that matter most to each patient and ultimately improve patient-centered care.",1
"Immunotherapy, Chemotherapy, or Both: Options for First-Line Therapy for Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.","The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice.The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the management of recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). The landmark KEYNOTE-048 clinical trial established the programmed death-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab with and without chemotherapy as a new standard first-line treatment for patients with platinum-sensitive R/M HNSCC. Nonetheless, clinical decision making can be challenging when considering the significant morbidity associated with rapidly progressive disease in high-risk locations, patient fitness, and programmed death-ligand 1 expression. Both planned and unplanned subgroup analyses from KEYNOTE-048 provide valuable insights into how therapy for untreated R/M HNSCC may be optimized for individual patients. Given differences in the toxicity profile of pembrolizumab alone versus in combination with chemotherapy, prioritizing patient preference is paramount in this palliative treatment setting. Here, the case of a patient presenting with de novo metastatic HNSCC is discussed to highlight the practical application of KEYNOTE-048 data in clinical practice.",0
Studying How Patient Engagement Influences Research: A Mixed Methods Study.,"BACKGROUND: There is evidence supporting the value of patient engagement (PE) in research to patients and researchers. However, there is little research evidence on the influence of PE throughout the entire research process as well as the outcomes of research engagement. The purpose of our study is to add to this evidence. METHODS: We used a convergent mixed method design to guide the integration of our survey data and observation data to assess the influence of PE in two groups, comprising patient research partners (PRPs), clinicians, and researchers. A PRP led one group (PLG) and an academic researcher led the other (RLG). Both groups were given the same research question and tasked to design and conduct an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related patient preference study. We administered validated evaluation tools at three points and observed PE in the two groups conducting the IBD study. RESULTS: PRPs in both groups took on many operational roles and influenced all stages of the IBD-related qualitative study: launch, design, implementation, and knowledge translation. PRPs provided more clarity on the study design, target population, inclusion-exclusion criteria, data collection approach, and the results. PRPs helped operationalize the project question, develop study material and data collection instruments, collect data, and present the data in a relevant and understandable manner to the patient community. The synergy of collaborative partnership resulted in two projects that were patient-centered, meaningful, understandable, legitimate, rigorous, adaptable, feasible, ethical and transparent, timely, and sustainable. CONCLUSION: Collaborative and meaningful engagement of patients and researchers can influence all stages of qualitative research including design and approach, and outputs.",0
A Narrative Synthesis of Literature on the Barriers to Timely Diagnosis and Treatment of Cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa.,"Poor cancer survival outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have been linked to delays in diagnosis and treatment. Here we present a detailed overview of the qualitative literature evaluating the barriers to receiving timely diagnosis and treatment of cancer in SSA. The PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO databases were searched to identify qualitative studies reporting on barriers to timely diagnosis of cancer in SSA published between 1995 and 2020. A systematic review methodology was applied, including quality assessment and narrative data synthesis. We identified 39 studies, of which 24 focused on breast or cervical cancer. Only one study focused on prostate cancer and one on lung cancer. When exploring factors contributing to delays, six key themes emerged from the data. The first theme was health service barriers, which included: (i) inadequate numbers of trained specialists; (ii) limited knowledge of cancer among healthcare providers; (iii) poor co-ordination of care; (iv) inadequately resourced health facilities; (v) negative attitudes of healthcare providers towards patients; (vi) high cost of diagnostic and treatment services. The second key theme was patient preference for complementary and alternative medicine; the third was the limited understanding of cancer among the population. The fourth barrier was a patient's personal and family obligations; the fifth was the perceived impact of cancer and its treatment on sexuality, body image and relationships. Finally, the sixth was the stigma and discrimination faced by patients following a diagnosis of cancer. In conclusion, health system, patient level and societal factors all influence the likelihood of timely diagnosis and treatment for cancer in SSA. The results provide a focus for targeting health system interventions, particular with regards to awareness and understanding of cancer in the region.",0
Insomnia and related mental health conditions: Essential neurobiological underpinnings towards reduced polypharmacy utilization rates.,"Insomnia represents a significant public health burden, with a 10% prevalence in the general population. Reduced sleep affects social and working functioning, productivity, and patient's quality of life, leading to a total of $100 billion per year in direct and indirect healthcare costs. Primary insomnia is unrelated to any other mental or medical illness; secondary insomnia co-occurs with other underlying medical, iatrogenic, or mental conditions. Epidemiological studies found a 40-50% comorbidity prevalence between insomnia and psychiatric disorders, suggesting a high relevance of mental health in insomniacs. Sleep disturbances also worsen the outcomes of several psychiatric disorders, leading to more severe psychopathology and incomplete remission, plausibly contributing to treatment-resistant conditions. Insomnia and psychiatric disorder coexistence can lead to polypharmacy, namely, the concurrent use of two or more medications in the same patient, regardless of their purpose or rationale. Polypharmacy increases the risk of using unnecessary drugs, the likelihood of drug interactions and adverse events, and reduces the patient's compliance due to regimen complexity. The workup of insomnia must consider the patient's sleep habits and inquire about any medical and mental concurrent conditions that must be handled to allow insomnia to be remitted adequately. Monotherapy or limited polypharmacy should be preferred, especially in case of multiple comorbidities, promoting multipurpose molecules with sedative properties and with bedtime administration. Also, non-pharmacological interventions for insomnia, such as sleep hygiene, relaxation training and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy may be useful in secondary insomnia to confront behaviors and thoughts contributing to insomnia and help optimizing the pharmacotherapy. However, insomnia therapy should always be patient-tailored, considering drug indications, contraindications, and pharmacokinetics, besides insomnia phenotype, clinical picture, patient preferences, and side effect profile.",0
Characteristics of international primary care practices and physicians related to advance care planning: a cross-sectional survey study.,"BACKGROUND: Primary care providers (PCPs) are well-situated to delivery primary palliative care such as advance care planning (ACP). The aim of this work is to identify practice characteristics, including features found in advanced primary care models (APCMs), that predict PCP engagement of patients in ACP. METHODS: We analyzed characteristics of physician respondents and their practices associated with ACP conversations in older and sicker patients using data from 11 countries who participated in the 2015 Commonwealth Fund International Survey of Primary Care Physicians in 10 Nations. The primary outcome was how routinely these ACP conversations are reported. We used a validated measure to describe practice-level characteristics of advanced primary care models. We conducted bivariate and multivariable analyses to determine PCP and practice characteristics associated with routinely engaging patients in ACP and with documenting patient preferences in medical records. RESULTS: Respondents (N = 12,049) predominantly were older than 45 and did not view their jobs as high stress. PCPs reported routinely engaging patients in ACP work in practices with more APCM features. They are more likely to view their jobs as high stress, to work more hours, to practice in rural areas, and to work in smaller practices. Multivariable analyses showed that older PCP age, higher perceived stress of the job, practice location in rural areas, and increased number of APCM features were associated with more ACP conversations. Increased number of APCM features was also associated with higher odds of routinely recording patient preferences in their medical records. CONCLUSIONS: In this international survey, physician and practice characteristics, including having features associated with APCMs, were associated with whether physicians routinely discuss ACP with patients who are older and sicker. Many features of APCMs may facilitate ACP discussions between PCPs and patients.",0
A Quantitative Framework for Medication Non-Adherence: Integrating Patient Treatment Expectations and Preferences.,"INTRODUCTION: Medication non-adherence remains a significant challenge in healthcare, impacting treatment outcomes and the overall effectiveness of medical interventions. This article introduces a novel approach to understanding and predicting medication non-adherence by integrating patient beliefs, efficacy expectations, and perceived costs. Existing theoretical models often fall short in quantifying the impact of barrier removal on medication adherence and struggle to address cases where patients consciously choose not to follow prescribed medication regimens. In response to these limitations, this study presents an empirical framework that seeks to provide a quantifiable model for both individual and population-level prediction of non-adherence under different scenarios. METHODS: We present an empirical framework that includes a health production function, specifically applied to antihypertensive medications nonadherence. Data collection involved a pilot study that utilized a double-bound contingent-belief (DBCB) questionnaire. Through this questionnaire, participants could express how efficacy and side effects were affected by controlled levels of non-adherence, allowing for the estimation of sensitivity in health outcomes and costs. RESULTS: Parameters derived from the DBCB questionnaire revealed that on average, patients with hypertension anticipated that treatment efficacy was less sensitive to non-adherence than side effects. Our derived health production function suggests that patients may strategically manage adherence to minimize side effects, without compromising efficacy. Patients' inclination to manage medication intake is closely linked to the relative importance they assign to treatment efficacy and side effects. Model outcomes indicate that patients opt for full adherence when efficacy outweighs side effects. Our findings also indicated an association between income and patient expectations regarding the health of antihypertensive medications. CONCLUSION: Our framework represents a pioneering effort to quantitatively link non-adherence to patient preferences. Preliminary results from our pilot study of patients with hypertension suggest that the framework offers a viable alternative for evaluating the potential impact of interventions on treatment adherence.",0
Post-operative Surveillance Following Curative Resection of Colorectal Cancer in the Elderly Population in the United Kingdom: An Observational Study.,"Background Colorectal cancer most commonly affects the elderly population. Post-colorectal cancer surveillance aims to reduce cancer incidence and mortality, but its necessity and effectiveness are debated, especially in the elderly population. This study explores the relevance of computer tomography (CT) and colonoscopy surveillance in patients aged 75 and over who have undergone curative resection for colorectal cancer. Methods A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was conducted on patients aged 75 and over who had undergone surgical resection of colorectal cancer between November 2014 and August 2021. Data on demographics, treatment, survival, and surveillance were gathered from electronic patient records. The primary outcome was adherence to follow-up colonoscopy and CT-scan surveillance following surgery. Results A total of 417 patients underwent colorectal cancer surgery, with 334 included for analysis. The cohort had an average age of 81 years, with the majority receiving laparoscopic surgery and primary anastomosis. Twelve-month CT surveillance showed normal results in 281 patients (91.8%), while 24-month CT surveillance demonstrated normal findings in 244 patients (88.7%). Only 175 patients (52.4%) had colonoscopy follow-up, with 94 (53.7%) showing normal results, 74 (42.3%) demonstrating benign polyps, and two patients (1.1%) having histologically proven cancer. Reasons for not undergoing colonoscopy included declining invitations (30 patients, 19.1%) and being too frail (45 patients, 28.7%). Conclusion This study reinforces the notion that colonoscopy surveillance for patients over the age of 75 may have limited benefits. In an ageing population, the benefits of surveillance in terms of early detection of recurrence must be balanced against the risks of harm from the procedure, the availability of further management, cost-effectiveness, and patient preferences. An individualised approach should be adopted, potentially with colonoscopy surveillance only recommended in patients of higher risk (extramural venous invasion (EMVI)) and a low frailty score with a life expectancy over 10 years.",0
Long-term outcomes after plaque excision grafting for Peyronie's disease and subanalysis of patients who undergo the procedure despite preoperative counseling against it.,"BACKGROUND: Plaque excision and grafting (PEG) has been recommended for patients with Peyronie's disease (PD) with >60° curvature and/or hinge effect and strong preoperative erections, while placement of an inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) is recommended when rigidity is suboptimal. Nevertheless, many patients counseled to undergo an IPP decline and insist on proceeding with PEG due to personal preference or desire to avoid an implant. AIM: We aim to review long-term outcomes in patients who underwent PEG for PD at our institution and investigate whether there is any difference in long-term outcomes in patients who undergo PEG despite a recommendation to undergo IPP. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review from 2007 to 2021 on PEG surgery performed at a single tertiary care institution in patients ≥18 years old who had >3 months of follow-up. OUTCOMES: Postoperative information was gathered from the electronic medical record, including postoperative erectile function, patient satisfaction, and the ability to engage in penetrative sexual intercourse. RESULTS: An overall 251 patients underwent PEG with a median follow-up of 12 months (IQR, 6-54). Among these, 54 (22%) were initially advised to undergo IPP but elected for PEG. Patients who underwent PEG despite counseling to undergo IPP reported lower postoperative ability to engage in intercourse (51% vs 76%). Seven (13%) patients initially advised to undergo IPP eventually received an IPP, relative to 7 (4%) initially advised to undergo PEG. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Thorough preoperative assessment of erectile function and penile deformity can guide clinician counseling and manage patient expectations during decision making between PEG surgery and IPP implantation for PD. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature, high attrition to follow-up, and risk of recall and selection bias. This is a large study with a median follow-up of 12 months, with a high-volume single surgeon who treats patients in a specialized population of complex cases. CONCLUSION: Patients who were initially counseled to undergo IPP due to suboptimal erectile rigidity but elected for PEG had worse postoperative ability to engage in penetrative intercourse, and a higher proportion of these patients eventually received an IPP.",0
"Latinx attitudes, barriers, and experiences with genetic counseling and testing: A systematic review.","As genetics is increasingly used across clinical settings, there is a need to understand the impact and experiences of diverse patients. This review systematically examined research literature on Latinx experiences with genetic counseling and genetic testing (GC/GT) in the United States, synthesizing key themes and knowledge gaps pertaining to both patient experience and hypothetical scenarios. Findings were based on a systematic search, inclusion, and thematic analysis of 81 empirical peer-reviewed articles published from January 1990 to July 2019 pertaining to Latinx populations and GC/GT. Studies most commonly addressed Latinas' perspectives on GC/GT in prenatal settings or for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Costs, referrals, and communication were significant barriers to accessing genetic services for many Latinx patients, particularly those with low English proficiency (LEP). Studies highlighted difficulties accessing and communicating in healthcare settings, and how medical context and prior experience with healthcare workers and institutions influenced GC/GT decision-making. Providers' implicit biases about Latinx patients negatively impacted their care and impeded communication. Despite low awareness of cancer GT, Latinx patients often reported interest in learning more about GC/GT or unmet needs for GT discussion and provider involvement. This systematic review identified areas where providers can take action to improve Latinx experiences with GC/GT. Clinicians should elicit and respond to patient preferences about shared decision-making. For patients with low numeracy or LEP, providers should consider tailored educational and communication techniques. Most studies focused on HBOC and prenatal testing, and Latinx patients are heterogeneous, leaving many research questions about Latinx experience with GT/GC in other clinical areas.",0
Understanding depression treatment and perinatal service preferences of Kenyan pregnant adolescents: A discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding mental health treatment preferences of adolescents and youth is particularly important for interventions to be acceptable and successful. Person-centered care mandates empowering individuals to take charge of their own health rather than being passive recipients of services. METHODS: We conducted a discrete choice experiment to quantitatively measure adolescent treatment preferences for different care characteristics and explore tradeoffs between these. A total of 153 pregnant adolescents were recruited from two primary healthcare facilities in the informal urban settlement of Nairobi. We selected eight attributes of depression treatment option models drawn from literature review and previous qualitative work. Bayesian d-efficient design was used to identify main effects. A total of ten choice tasks were solicited per respondent. We evaluated mean preferences using mixed logit models to adjust for within subject correlation and account for unobserved heterogeneity. RESULTS: Respondents showed a positive preference that caregivers be provided with information sheets, as opposed to co-participation with caregivers. With regards to treatment options, the respondents showed a positive preference for 8 sessions as compared to 4 sessions. With regards to intervention delivery agents, the respondents had a positive preference for facility nurses as compared to community health volunteers. In terms of support, the respondents showed positive preference for parenting skills as compared to peer support. Our respondents expressed negative preferences of ANC service combined with older mothers as compared to adolescent friendly services and of being offered refreshments alone. A positive preference was revealed for combined refreshments and travel allowance over travel allowance or refreshments alone. A number of these suggestions were about enhancing their experience of maternity clinical care experience. CONCLUSION: This study highlights unique needs of this population. Pregnant adolescents' value responsive maternity and depression care services offered by nurses. Participants shared preference for longer psychotherapy sessions and their preference was to have adolescent centered maternal mental health and child health services within primary care.",1
"A Randomized, Open-label, Cross-over Phase 2 Trial of Darolutamide and Enzalutamide in Men with Asymptomatic or Mildly Symptomatic Metastatic Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer: Patient Preference and Cognitive Function in ODENZA.","BACKGROUND: Darolutamide and enzalutamide are second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors with activity in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and different toxicity profiles. OBJECTIVE: ODENZA is a prospective, randomized, multicenter, cross-over, phase 2 trial designed to assess preference between darolutamide and enzalutamide in men with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC (mCRPC). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either darolutamide 1200 mg/d for 12 wk followed by enzalutamide 160 mg/d for 12 wk or enzalutamide followed by darolutamide. In both arms, the second treatment was given in absence of cancer progression. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was patient preference between the two drugs, as assessed by a preference questionnaire (p value calculated with the Prescott test). After week 24, patients entered an extension period during which they received their preferred treatment until progression or toxicity. The main secondary objectives included reasons for patient preference, response at week 12, tolerance of each drug, and measurement compared with baseline of cognitive outcomes assessed using tablet questionnaires. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 249 patients, with a median age of 72 yr, were randomized. Among the 200 patients who fulfilled the preplanned criteria for the evaluation of the primary endpoint of preference, 97 (49% [41; 56]), 80 (40% [33; 47]), and 23 (12% [7; 16]) chose darolutamide, chose enzalutamide, and had no preference, respectively (p = 0.92). Reduced fatigue, easier administration, and better quality of life were the main criteria that influenced patient choice. A moderate benefit in episodic memory from darolutamide was observed for the acquisition of new information (least square [LS] means difference = 2.2, effect size = 0.5) and for the recall of that information after a brief delay (LS means difference = 0.7, effect size = 0.3). Using the Brief Fatigue Inventory questionnaire, patients reported greater fatigue with enzalutamide (3.3 [3.0; 3.6]) than with darolutamide (2.7 [2.4; 3.0]). There was no difference in terms of depression, seizures, and falls. CONCLUSIONS: The study did not show a difference in preference between the two treatments. In men with mCRPC, darolutamide was associated with a clinically meaningful benefit in episodic memory and less fatigue compared with enzalutamide. PATIENT SUMMARY: Preference between darolutamide and enzalutamide was well balanced in men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Darolutamide was associated with a significant benefit in verbal learning and less fatigue compared with enzalutamide.",0
Strategies to Bridge Equitable Implementation of Telehealth.,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapid scaling of telehealth limited the extent to which proactive planning for equitable implementation was possible. The deployment of telehealth will persist in the postpandemic era, given patient preferences, advances in technologies, growing acceptance of telehealth, and the potential to overcome barriers to serve populations with limited access to high-quality in-person care. However, aspects and unintended consequences of telehealth may leave some groups underserved or unserved, and corrective implementation plans that address equitable access will be needed. The purposes of this paper are to (1) describe equitable implementation in telehealth and (2) integrate an equity lens into actionable equitable implementation.",0
Preferences of People Living with HIV for Long-Acting Antiretroviral Treatment in Germany: Evidence from a Discrete Choice Experiment.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elicit preferences for attributes of current and novel long-acting antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus treatment. METHODS: Primary survey data were collected (July-October 2022) on a sample of 333 people living with human immunodeficiency virus in Germany from a patient recruitment agency. Respondents were invited by e-mail to respond to a web-based questionnaire. After performing a systematic literature review, we conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews to identify and select the key attributes of drug therapy for patients' preferences for human immunodeficiency virus treatment. Based on this, a discrete choice experiment survey elicited preferences for long-acting antiretroviral therapy characteristics, including the type of medication, frequency of dosing, the location of treatment, the risk of both short-term and long-term side effects, as well as possible interactions with other medications or (party) drugs. A statistical data analysis was performed using multinomial logit models. An additional latent class multinomial logit was performed to evaluate subgroup differences. RESULTS: Overall, 226 respondents (86% male, mean age 46.1 years) were included in the analysis. The frequency of dosing (36.1%) and the risk of long-term side effects (28.2%) had the greatest influence on preferences. The latent class analysis identified two patient groups. While the first class (n = 135; 87% male, mean age 44.4 years) found the frequency of dosing (44.1%) to be most important, the second class (n = 91; 85% male, mean age 48.6 years) focused on the risk of long-term side effects (50.3%). The evaluation of structural variables showed that male respondents, those living in small cities or villages, and those with better health status results were significantly more likely to be assigned to the second class (p < 0.05 each). CONCLUSIONS: All attributes included in our survey were important to participants when choosing an antiretroviral therapy. We found evidence that the frequency of dosing as well as the risk of long-term side effects have a particular impact on the acceptance of novel therapy regimens and should be considered in order to optimize adherence and satisfaction.",1
Interrelationship between dental clinicians and laboratory technicians: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Effective communication among members of the dental team is essential for the delivery of high-quality dental care. However, an in-depth understanding of issues concerning the interrelationship between dental clinicians and laboratory technicians has not been previously undertaken. Therefore, the aim of the study was to explore factors influencing the interrelationship between dental clinicians and laboratory technicians. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with dental clinicians and laboratory technicians using purposeful snowball sampling. Two trained researchers conducted the interviews based on a pre-piloted topic guide. The interviews were conducted via video conferencing platform, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Field notes were taken during the interviews. Framework Methodology was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 20 dental clinicians and laboratory technicians were interviewed. The average interview duration was 37 min. Participants mainly reported negative encounters and highlighted the importance of training and exposure, collaborative learning, and alignment of expectations of both parties in terms of cost of laboratory work, turnaround time, and patient preferences. The relationship between dental clinicians and laboratory technicians depends largely on effective teamwork dynamics and open communication channels. Increased workload, workforce shortage, availability of digital systems, management policies, and financial challenges were emphasized as organizational factors affecting the interrelationship between both groups. Participants highlighted the importance of shadowing, mentorship, education courses, joint discussions, patient-technician rapport, and adoption of digital technology for fostering collaborative practices between the professions. CONCLUSIONS: A multitude of factors influencing the dental clinician-laboratory interrelationship at individual, interpersonal and organizational levels were identified. This study highlights the need to build a transformative relationship underpinned by mutual trust and respect. Such a collaborative relationship will facilitate optimal patient care and successful treatment outcomes. The outcome of this study can help stakeholders identify solutions for enhancing the interrelationship among the dental team, to ultimately improve patient care and efficiency of dental services.",0
Ageism scale for dental students (ASDS): A focus group review of content validity.,"PURPOSE/AIM: Improve content validity of the Ageism Scale for Dental Students (ASDS) and identify barriers to using the scale. METHODS: Thematic analysis of transcripts of three purposively sampled focus groups of 1) geriatric dentistry specialists, 2) older adult dental patients, and 3) dental students. RESULTS: Twenty-five participants engaged in focus groups. No new concepts to define ageism were identified. Experts found the scale acceptable and appropriate, yet they raised specific potential revisions to scale questions. Commonly reported themes already addressed by ASDS included the importance of tailoring decision-making to patient preference and not making assumptions about older adults' capacity or preferences for dental care. Barriers to identifying ageism or using the scale included experiential differences in interpreting scale items, cultural differences in attitudes towards older adults, and potential overlap with social determinants of health. Secondary findings include recommendations for older-adult focused training for dental students to provide positive, concrete guidance on caring for older adults. CONCLUSION: There are opportunities to refine the Ageism Scale for Dental Students and to allow tailoring of the scale for specific national or cultural contexts.",0
Comparative analysis of algorithm-guided treatment and predefined duration treatment programmes for depression: exploring cost-effectiveness using routine care data.,"BACKGROUND: More knowledge on the cost-effectiveness of various depression treatment programmes can promote efficient treatment allocation and improve the quality of depression care. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the real-world cost-effectiveness of an algorithm-guided programme focused on remission to a predefined duration, patient preference-centred treatment programme focused on response using routine care data. METHODS: A naturalistic study (n=6295 in the raw dataset) was used to compare the costs and outcomes of two programmes in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and depression-free days (DFD). Analyses were performed from a healthcare system perspective over a 2-year time horizon. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated, and the uncertainty of results was assessed using bootstrapping and sensitivity analysis. FINDINGS: The algorithm-guided treatment programme per client yielded more DFDs (12) and more QALYs (0.013) at a higher cost (€3070) than the predefined duration treatment programme. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were around €256/DFD and €236 154/QALY for the algorithm guided compared with the predefined duration treatment programme. At a threshold value of €50 000/QALY gained, the programme had a probability of <10% of being considered cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm-guided programme led to larger health gains than the predefined duration treatment programme, but it was considerably more expensive, and hence not cost-effective at current Dutch thresholds. Depending on the preferences and budgets available, each programme has its own benefits. CLINICAL IMPLICATION: This study provides valuable information to decision-makers for optimising treatment allocation and enhancing quality of care cost-effectively.",0
Hospital Culture and Intensity of End-of-Life Care at 3 Academic Medical Centers.,"IMPORTANCE: There is substantial institutional variability in the intensity of end-of-life care that is not explained by patient preferences. Hospital culture and institutional structures (eg, policies, practices, protocols, resources) might contribute to potentially nonbeneficial high-intensity life-sustaining treatments near the end of life. OBJECTIVE: To understand the role of hospital culture in the everyday dynamics of high-intensity end-of-life care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This comparative ethnographic study was conducted at 3 academic hospitals in California and Washington that differed in end-of-life care intensity based on measures in the Dartmouth Atlas and included hospital-based clinicians, administrators, and leaders. Data were deductively and inductively analyzed using thematic analysis through an iterative coding process. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Institution-specific policies, practices, protocols, and resources and their role in the everyday dynamics of potentially nonbeneficial, high-intensity life-sustaining treatments. RESULTS: A total of 113 semistructured, in-depth interviews (66 women [58.4%]; 23 [20.4%] Asian, 1 [0.9%] Black, 5 [4.4%] Hispanic, 7 [6.2%] multiracial, and 70 [61.9%] White individuals) were conducted with inpatient-based clinicians and administrators between December 2018 and June 2022. Respondents at all hospitals described default tendencies to provide high-intensity treatments that they believed were universal in US hospitals. They also reported that proactive, concerted efforts among multiple care teams were required to deescalate high-intensity treatments. Efforts to deescalate were vulnerable to being undermined at multiple points during a patient's care trajectory by any individual or entity. Respondents described institution-specific policies, practices, protocols, and resources that engendered broadly held understandings of the importance of deescalating nonbeneficial life-sustaining treatments. Respondents at different hospitals reported different policies and practices that encouraged or discouraged deescalation. They described how these institutional structures contributed to the culture and everyday dynamics of end-of-life care at their institution. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this qualitative study, clinicians, administrators, and leaders at the hospitals studied reported that they work in a hospital culture in which high-intensity end-of-life care constitutes a default trajectory. Institutional structures and hospital cultures shape the everyday dynamics by which clinicians may deescalate end-of-life patients from this trajectory. Individual behaviors or interactions may fail to mitigate potentially nonbeneficial high-intensity life-sustaining treatments if extant hospital culture or a lack of supportive policies and practices undermine individual efforts. Hospital cultures need to be considered when developing policies and interventions to decrease potentially nonbeneficial, high-intensity life-sustaining treatments.",0
Physician Perspectives on Telemedicine in Radiation Oncology.,"PURPOSE: Telemedicine enthusiasm and uptake in radiation oncology rapidly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is unclear if and how telemedicine should be used after the COVID-19 public health emergency ends is unclear. Herein, we report on our institution's provider experience after the mature adoption of telemedicine. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We distributed a survey to all radiation oncology attending physicians at our institution in October 2021 to assess satisfaction, facilitators, and barriers to telemedicine implementation. We performed quantitative and qualitative analyses to characterize satisfaction and identify influencing factors whether telemedicine is employed. We calculated the average proportion of visits that providers expected to be appropriately performed with telemedicine for each disease site and visit type. RESULTS: A total of 60 of the 82 eligible radiation oncologists (73%) responded to the survey, of whom 78% were satisfied with telemedicine in the radiation oncology department and 83% wished to continue offering video visits after the COVID-19 public health emergency ends. Common patient factors influencing whether physicians offer telemedicine include the patient's travel burden, patient preferences, and whether a physical examination is required. Approximately 20% of new consultations and 50% of weekly management visits were estimated to be appropriate for telemedicine. The central nervous system/pediatrics and thoracic faculty considered telemedicine appropriate for the greatest proportion of new consultations, and 93% of respondents felt comfortable determining whether telemedicine was appropriate. CONCLUSIONS: Surveyed radiation oncologists were satisfied with telemedicine in their practice, and wished to continue offering video visits in the future. Our data suggest that payers should continue to support this patient-centered technology.",0
Public preferences for online medical consultations in China: a discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Online medical consultation (OMC) is significant to promote the utilization and accessibility of healthcare resources and save time on consultation. However, the usage and public acceptance rates of it are still low in China. Meanwhile, few studies have focused on consumers' demand of OMC services. This study aims to identify attributes that influence users' preference for OMC services, quantify the value of these characteristics, and compare their relative importance. METHODS: A nationwide discrete choice experiment was conducted to survey Chinese residents' preference choices for six attributes of OMC services. Conditional logit model and mixed logit model were used to analyze respondents' preference. Willingness to pay and heterogeneity were estimated by the mixed logit model. RESULTS: A total of 856 respondents completed the study, and 668 questionnaires passed the consistency test. All of 6 attributes in the study were statistically significant except for ""Doctor's professional title - Associate Senior."" When choosing OMC services, respondents preferred to spend as little time and money as possible on a large online medical platform to consult a high-rated physician with a senior title from a well-known Grade-A tertiary hospital. Besides, respondents valued doctor's evaluation score most and were willing to pay ¥107 to obtain the services of higher-scored doctors. CONCLUSION: The study measured Chinese residents' preferences for six attributes of OMC and showed the heterogeneity of attributes among subgroups. Our findings suggested that OMC services providers should reduce the customers' waiting time, improve the quality of services and enhance professional skills to meet the customers' requirements. More research on preferences for OMC needs to be conducted in China, especially for key populations such as patients with chronic diseases.",1
Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of active Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy in persons with diabetes mellitus (IWGDF 2023).,"The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence-based guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease since 1999. This is the first guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of active Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy in persons with diabetes published by the IWGDF. We followed the GRADE Methodology to devise clinical questions in the PACO (Population, Assessment, Comparison, Outcome) and PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) format, conducted a systematic review of the medical literature, and developed recommendations with the rationale. The recommendations are based on the evidence from our systematic review, expert opinion when evidence was not available, and also taking into account weighing of the benefits and harms, patient preferences, feasibility and applicability, and costs related to an intervention. We here present the 2023 Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of active Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy in persons with diabetes mellitus and also suggest key future topics of research.",0
Association of Open Reduction and Internal Fixation With Volar Locking Plate for Distal Radius Fractures With Patient-Reported Outcomes in Older Adults: A Network Meta-analysis.,"IMPORTANCE: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have reported inconsistent conclusions regarding optimal distal radius fracture (DRF) treatment in older adults and are limited due to the inclusion of cohort studies with small sample sizes. A network meta-analysis (NMA) addresses these limitations by only synthesizing direct and indirect evidence from RCTs and may clarify optimal DRF treatment in older adults. OBJECTIVE: To examine DRF treatment results in optimal short-term and intermediate-term patient-reported outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were conducted for RCTs that investigated DRF treatment outcomes in older adults between January 1, 2000, and January 1, 2022. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials including patients with a mean age of 50 years or older that compared the following DRF treatments were eligible for inclusion: casting, open reduction and internal fixation with volar lock plating (ORIF), external fixation, percutaneous pinning, and nail fixation. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers independently completed all data extraction. An NMA aggregated all direct and indirect evidence among DRF treatments. Treatments were ranked by surface under the cumulative ranking curve score. Data are reported as standard mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was short-term (≤3 months) and intermediate-term (>3 months to 1 year) Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire scores. Secondary outcomes included Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) scores and 1-year complication rates. RESULTS: In this NMA, 23 RCTs consisting of 3054 participants (2495 women [81.7%]) with a mean (SD) age of 66 (7.8) years were included. At 3 months, DASH scores were significantly lower for nail fixation (SMD, -18.28; 95% CI, -29.93 to -6.63) and ORIF (SMD, -9.28; 95% CI, -13.90 to -4.66) compared with casting. The PRWE scores were also significantly lower for ORIF (SMD, -9.55; 95% CI, -15.31 to -3.79) at 3 months. In the intermediate term, ORIF was associated with lowered DASH (SMD, -3.35; 95% CI, -5.90 to -0.80) and PRWE (SMD, -2.90; 95% CI, -4.86 to -0.94) scores. One-year complication rates were comparable among all treatments. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this NMA suggest that ORIF may be associated with clinically significant improvements in short-term recovery compared with casting for multiple patient-reported outcomes measures with no increase in 1-year complication rates. Shared decision-making with patients may be useful to identify patient preferences regarding recovery to determine optimal treatment.",0
Rapid implementation of remote digital primary care in Stockholm and implications for further system-wide implementation: practitioner's and manager's experience of the Always Open mobile application.,"OBJECTIVE: To contribute actionable knowledge how to increase appropriate use of digital technologies in primary care by understanding clinical managers experiences with a digital connection system, Always Open, during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: The overall design was a qualitative study with directed content analysis method. Data were collected from documents and focus group (n = 12) interviews with clinical managers (n = 99) of primary care. The seven domains of the Non-adoption, Abandonment, and challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) framework was used to understand the implementation process, as described by the clinical managers. RESULTS: Focus group participants reported that their units made their own local decisions to make more use of the technology provided by the health system. Most participants considered that the technology was ready to use, despite some limitations, that included individual clinician's and patient preferences, and how ready their unit was for making changes to practice and organization. Some raised concerns about how standardizing some aspects possibly conflicted with the decentralized management model of the organization. The overall experience was reported to be positive, with an intention to sustain the achievements. CONCLUSION: Focus group interviews found that clinical unit managers reported that they and their staff were positive about the digital technology system for remote care. For the future, they wanted changes to be made at different levels of the health system to better combine digital and physical care. Possibilities to use digital technology to integrate primary and hospital health care were identified.",0
ECCO Topical Review on Biological Treatment Cycles in Crohn's Disease.,"There are now a growing number of licensed biological therapies for patients with Crohn's disease. However, there can be significant costs associated with long-term maintenance treatment, as well as some concerns about potential side-effects. As a result, there has been increasing interest in elective biological treatment discontinuation in selected patients, after a sustained period of remission. Following discontinuation, in cases of relapse, evidence to date has suggested that remission may often be regained by re-treatment with the same biological agent. Therefore, a concept has emerged in which cycles of biological therapy might be used. If this treatment strategy were to be applied in a subgroup of patients at low risk of relapse, cycling might allow a substantial number of patients to have a lower, overall therapeutic burden-ensuring decreased exposure to biological therapy but still enabling appropriate disease control. Currently, there remains uncertainty about the benefit-risk balance for using cycles of biological treatment for patients with Crohn's disease. Accordingly, an expert panel was convened by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [ECCO] to review the published literature and agree a series of consensus practice points. The panel aimed to provide evidence-based guidance on multiple aspects of biological treatment discontinuation and cycling, including the risk of relapse after elective treatment discontinuation, predictors of probable relapse or remission, safety, patient preferences, and pharmacoeconomic aspects. Crucially, discussions about biological treatment discontinuation and cycling should be individualized, to enable shared decision-making by patients with their clinicians.",0
Incorporating Prior Data in Quantitative Benefit-Risk Assessments: Case Study of a Bayesian Method.,"BACKGROUND: Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) in their current implementation cannot incorporate prior or external information on benefits and risks. We demonstrate how to incorporate prior data using a Bayesian mixture model approach while conducting quantitative benefit-risk assessments (qBRA) for medical products. METHODS: We implemented MCDA and SMAA in a Bayesian framework. To incorporate information from a prior study, we use mixture priors on each benefit and risk attribute that mixes information from a previous study with a vague prior distribution. The degree of borrowing is varied using a mixing proportion parameter. RESULTS: A demonstration case study for qBRA using the supplementary New Drug Application (sNDA) filing for Rivaroxaban for the indication of reduction in the risk of major thrombotic vascular events in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) was used to illustrate the method. Net utility scores, obtained from the randomized controlled trial data to support the sNDA, from the MCDA for Rivaraxoban and comparator were 0.48 and 0.56, respectively, with Rivaroxaban being the preferred alternative only 33% of the time. We show that with only 30% borrowing from a previous RCT, the MCDA and SMAA results are favorable for Rivaroxaban, accounting for the seemingly aberrant results on all-cause death in the trial data used to support the sNDA. CONCLUSION: Our method to formally incorporate prior data in MCDA and SMAA is easy to use and interpret. Software in the form of an RShiny App is available here: https://sai-dharmarajan.shinyapps.io/BayesianMCDA_SMAA/ .",1
Factors influencing gender preference towards surgeons among Jordanian adults: an investigation of healthcare bias.,"Studies investigating gender bias against female surgeons yielded conflicting results ranging from neutrality to a clear preference towards male surgeons. Yet, such bias remains understudied within Middle Eastern nations. We aimed to assess preferences of surgeons' gender among Jordanians and explore reasons for possible gender bias across different surgical specialties. A total of 1708 respondents were examined using a cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire to evaluate the gender preferences of surgeons, characteristics associated with preferred surgeon's gender, and surgeon's preference in certain specialties. Nearly 52.0% of participants had no gender preference for surgeons. Among those with a preference, 75.7% preferred male surgeons while 24.3% preferred female surgeons. Reputation, knowledge, and experience were the most important factors when choosing a surgeon. Male surgeons were viewed as more trustworthy, knowledgeable, experienced, and communicative. Female surgeons were dominantly perceived as more compassionate, cooperative, and prone to listen. Male respondents were 5 times more likely to choose a surgeon of similar gender (OR 5.687; CI 3.791-8.531). Male surgeons were favored for cardiovascular and orthopedic surgeries. Similarly, female surgeons were favored in gynecological and obstetric surgeries, plastic surgeries, and breast surgeries. Female gender (OR 6.193; CI 4.077-9.408), living outside Amman (OR 1.517; CI 1.066-2.160), and being married (OR 2.504; CI 1.601-3.917) were all significant positive predictors of preferring female surgeons. Our findings highlight differences in gender preference and perception of surgeons among Jordanian adults.",0
Implant Preference and Clinical Outcomes of Patients with Staged Bilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty: All-Polyethylene and Contralateral Metal-Backed Tibial Components.,"Numerous studies have compared metal-backed components (MBTs) and all-polyethylene tibial components (APTs), but none of them specifically analysed the clinical results and the overall patient preference in patients who had undergone a staged bilateral knee replacement. The purpose of this study is to compare clinical results, perceived range of motion, and overall implant preference among patients who had undergone staged bilateral knee replacement with an APT and contralateral knee replacement with MBTs. A dataset of 62 patients from a single centre who underwent staged bilateral TKA between 2009 and 2022 was selected and retrospectively analysed. Tibial component removal was performed in three knees overall, all of which had MBTs. The mean measured Knee Score (KS) of knees with APTs was 78.37 and that of contralateral knees with MBTs was 77.4. The mean measured Function (FS) of knees with APTs was 78.22, and that of contralateral knees with MBs was 76.29. The mean flexion angle of knees with APTs was 103.8 and that for knees with MBTs was 101.04 degrees. A total of 54.8% of the patients preferred the knee that received APTs over contralateral MBTs. In our cohort, TKA with an APT in one knee and an MBT in the contralateral knee recorded similar clinical results and perceived ranges of motion. Patients in general preferred the knee that received an APT over contralateral knee with an MBT.",0
Advance Care Planning in Serious Illness: A Narrative Review.,"CONTEXT: Advance care planning (ACP) intends to support person-centered medical decision-making by eliciting patient preferences. Research has not identified significant associations between ACP and goal-concordant end-of-life care, leading to justified scientific debate regarding ACP utility. OBJECTIVE: To delineate ACP's potential benefits and missed opportunities and identify an evidence-informed, clinically relevant path ahead for ACP in serious illness. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review merging the best available ACP empirical data, grey literature, and emergent scholarly discourse using a snowball search of PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar (2000-2022). Findings were informed by our team's interprofessional clinical and research expertise in serious illness care. RESULTS: Early ACP practices were largely tied to mandated document completion, potentially failing to capture the holistic preferences of patients and surrogates. ACP models focused on serious illness communication rather than documentation show promising patient and clinician results. Ideally, ACP would lead to goal-concordant care even amid the unpredictability of serious illness trajectories. But ACP might also provide a false sense of security that patients' wishes will be honored and revisited at end-of-life. An iterative, 'building block' framework to integrate ACP throughout serious illness is provided alongside clinical practice, research, and policy recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: We advocate a balanced approach to ACP, recognizing empirical deficits while acknowledging potential benefits and ethical imperatives (e.g., fostering clinician-patient trust and shared decision-making). We support prioritizing patient/surrogate-centered outcomes with more robust measures to account for interpersonal clinician-patient variables that likely inform ACP efficacy and may better evaluate information gleaned during serious illness encounters.",0
Developing hospital resilience domains in facing disruption era in Indonesia: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: The studies of hospital resilience have been of increasing importance during the last decade due to disasters and pandemics. However, studies in developing the domain and indicators of hospital resilience were limited mainly on disaster response. A few studies of hospital resilience focused on how to deal with disruptions such as environmental turbulence, rapid technological changes, and changes in patient preferences. This study aims to develop domains and indicators of hospital resilience in facing the disruption era. METHODS: This qualitative study focused on exploring the domains and indicators to face disruptions that have been identified in the first exploratory phase of the studies. Key informants included hospital experts from the government, medical practitioners, and academics. A total of 20 key informants were involved in semi-structured interviews which were conducted face-to-face, via telephone and Zoom. Data was analyzed using a grounded theory approach to discover domains for a resilient hospital. RESULTS: The study identified a number of domains that are fundamental for a hospital to become a resilient in the face of disruption. These include readiness to face digital transformation, effective leadership, and flexibility in managing resources among others. Situation awareness and resilience ethos, implementation of marketing management, networking, and disaster anticipation are found to be equally important. These domains focused on the hospital's ability to deal with specific shocks from different perspectives as the result of changes from disruptions which are inevitable within the organizational business environment. CONCLUSIONS: The domains identified in the study are able to respond to the limitations of the concept of hospital resilience, which is currently more focused on hospital disaster resilience. They can be used to measure hospital resilience in the context of the volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA), which are relevant to the context of the Indonesia hospital industry.",0
Allergic Rhinitis: A Review.,"IMPORTANCE: Allergic rhinitis affects an estimated 15% of the US population (approximately 50 million individuals) and is associated with the presence of asthma, eczema, chronic or recurrent sinusitis, cough, and both tension and migraine headaches. OBSERVATIONS: Allergic rhinitis occurs when disruption of the epithelial barrier allows allergens to penetrate the mucosal epithelium of nasal passages, inducing a T-helper type 2 inflammatory response and production of allergen-specific IgE. Allergic rhinitis typically presents with symptoms of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, postnasal drainage, sneezing, and itching of the eyes, nose, and throat. In an international study, the most common symptoms of allergic rhinitis were rhinorrhea (90.38%) and nasal congestion (94.23%). Patients with nonallergic rhinitis present primarily with nasal congestion and postnasal drainage frequently associated with sinus pressure, ear plugging, muffled sounds and pain, and eustachian tube dysfunction that is less responsive to nasal corticosteroids. Patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis typically have physical examination findings of edematous and pale turbinates. Patients with perennial allergic rhinitis typically have erythematous and inflamed turbinates with serous secretions that appear similar to other forms of chronic rhinitis at physical examination. Patients with nonallergic rhinitis have negative test results for specific IgE aeroallergens. Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as symptoms occurring less than 4 consecutive days/week or less than 4 consecutive weeks/year. Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as symptoms occurring more often than 4 consecutive days/week and for more than 4 consecutive weeks/year. Patients with allergic rhinitis should avoid inciting allergens. In addition, first-line treatment for mild intermittent or mild persistent allergic rhinitis may include a second-generation H1 antihistamine (eg, cetirizine, fexofenadine, desloratadine, loratadine) or an intranasal antihistamine (eg, azelastine, olopatadine), whereas patients with persistent moderate to severe allergic rhinitis should be treated initially with an intranasal corticosteroid (eg, fluticasone, triamcinolone, budesonide, mometasone) either alone or in combination with an intranasal antihistamine. In contrast, first-line therapy for patients with nonallergic rhinitis consists of an intranasal antihistamine as monotherapy or in combination with an intranasal corticosteroid. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Allergic rhinitis is associated with symptoms of nasal congestion, sneezing, and itching of the eyes, nose, and throat. Patients with allergic rhinitis should be instructed to avoid inciting allergens. Therapies include second-generation H1 antihistamines (eg, cetirizine, fexofenadine, desloratadine, loratadine), intranasal antihistamines (eg, azelastine, olopatadine), and intranasal corticosteroids (eg, fluticasone, triamcinolone, budesonide, mometasone) and should be selected based on the severity and frequency of symptoms and patient preference.",0
Informed Decision Making for Anticoagulation Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must decide between warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), a decision involving important tradeoffs. Our objective was to understand whether physicians engage patients in informed decision making for anticoagulants. DESIGN: We performed an analysis of recorded conversations between physicians and anticoagulation-naïve patients in the Verilogue Point-of-Practice database. We assessed the presence of 7 elements of informed decision making, as well as a discussion of financial costs. RESULTS: Of 37 encounters with 21 physicians, 92% resulted in a DOAC prescription and 8% resulted in a warfarin prescription. Seventy percent met criteria for discussion of pros and cons, 70% for discussion of the alternatives, 43% presented the decision, 30% included an assessment of patient understanding, 22% included an explanation of the patient's role in decision making, 22% included an assessment of patient preferences, and 19% included a discussion of uncertainty. Two encounters (5%) included all 7 elements and 9 (24%) included none. Physicians discussed treatment costs with patients in 43% of encounters. LIMITATIONS: We assessed informed decision making in a single encounter. Physicians and patients may have had other discussions that were not captured in our data. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians often presented the alternatives but did not generally engage patients in informed decision making. The high rate of DOAC prescriptions is likely the result of physician preferences, as patient preferences were rarely assessed. IMPLICATIONS: Strategies to support physicians in engaging patients in informed decision making for anticoagulation are needed. HIGHLIGHTS: While physicians discussed the alternatives and presented pros and cons with patients, they rarely assessed patient preferences, explained the patient's role in decision making, or addressed uncertainty.The cost of treatment with DOACs versus warfarin was discussed by physicians in less than half of encounters, limiting patients' ability to make informed decisions for anticoagulation.Only 2 encounters (5%) fulfilled all 7 elements of informed decision making.",0
"Development of a web-based, theory-guided narrative intervention for women at elevated risk for breast cancer.","OBJECTIVE: To describe the development of a web-based, theory-guided narrative intervention that replaces conventional pre-test genetic counseling for women at elevated breast cancer risk. METHODS: We used an iterative process that was guided by health behavior theory and feedback from multiple stakeholder groups including: 1) content input from genetic experts; 2) study team input; 3) review of video storyboards, video example, study logo, recruitment materials, post-test patient preference counseling survey, and additional study surveys; 4) video series development; and 5) intervention review and finalization of study-related materials. RESULTS: The intervention is patient-centered providing convenience and an opportunity for an individual's preferences for post-test counseling delivery. The intervention's efficacy is being determined in a randomized controlled trial compared to conventional genetic counseling for adherence to recommended guidelines and changes in knowledge, perception of breast cancer risk, breast cancer-specific worry, and satisfaction with counseling. CONCLUSION: If efficacious, the intervention may improve the delivery of the genetic testing and counseling process, inform best practices, and reduce the genetic counseling workforce burden. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The developed intervention has the potential to improve the genetic testing and counseling experience for women at elevated risk for breast cancer, inform best practices, and reduce genetic counseling workforce burden.",0
Establishment of Prospective Registry of Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: The Korean Urological Oncology Society Database.,"PURPOSE: To establish a prospective registry for the active surveillance (AS) of prostate cancer (PC) using the Korean Urological Oncology Society (KUOS) database and to present interim analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The KUOS registry of AS for PC (KUOS-AS-PC) was organized in May 2019 and comprises multiple institutions nationwide. The eligibility criteria were as follows: patients with (1) pathologically proven PC; (2) pre-biopsy prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤20 ng/mL; (3) International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 1 or 2 (no cribriform pattern 4); (4) clinical T stage ≤T2c; (5) positive core ratio ≤50%; and (6) maximal cancer involvement in the core ≤50%. Detailed longitudinal clinical information, including multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging and disease-specific outcomes, was recorded. RESULTS: From May 2019 to June 2021, 296 patients were enrolled, and 284 were analyzed. The mean±standard deviation (SD) age at enrollment was 68.7±8.2 years. The median follow-up period was 11.2 months (5.9-16.8 mo). Majority of patients had pre-biopsy PSA ≤10 ng/mL (91.2%), PSA density <0.2 ng/mL² (79.7%), ISUP grade group 1 (94.4%), single positive core (65.7%), maximal cancer involvement in the core ≤20% (78.1%), and clinical T stage of T1c or lower (72.9%). Fifty-two (18.3%) discontinued AS for various reasons. Interventions included radical prostatectomy (80.8%), transurethral prostatectomy (5.8%), primary androgen deprivation therapy (5.8%), radiation (5.8%), and focal therapy (1.9%). The mean±SD time to intervention was 8.9±5.2 months. The reasons for discontinuation included pathologic reclassification (59.6%), patient preference (25.0%), and radiologic reclassification (9.6%). Two (4.8%) patients with pathologic Gleason score upgraded to ISUP grade group 4, no biochemical recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The KUOS established a successful prospective database of PC patients undergoing AS in Korea, named the KUOS-AS-PC registry.",0
Nurses' perception of the hospitals' culture and readiness of evidence-based practise integration in the hospital's system in western Ethiopia.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based practise is a method by which healthcare professionals integrate the best available evidence, individual expertise and patient preferences to improve patient safety and utilise quality healthcare. No study was conducted in Ethiopia to assess the nurses' perception of the hospitals' culture and readiness for evidence-based practice integration into the hospital's system. Hence, this study aimed to assess the perception of nurses on the hospitals' culture and readiness of evidence-based practise integration in hospitals' systems in Western Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 412 nurses in six hospitals in western Ethiopia was conducted between December 2022 and February 2023. A 25-item Organisational Culture and Readiness of System-Wide Integration of EBP scale was used, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.94. While 25 is the minimum score, 125 is the maximum; higher scores indicate better hospital culture and readiness for system-wide integration of evidence-based practice. A self-administered data collection technique was used. Descriptive statistics were computed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 25 software. RESULTS: Four hundred and twelve nurses participated in the study. The majority (85.9%) were bachelor's degree holders and over a third (34.7%) worked in primary hospitals. Only a quarter (26.5%) had ever received mentorship from their leader on implementing evidence-based practice. The overall hospital culture and readiness score for system-wide integration of evidence-based practice among nurses in six hospitals was 70.3 ± 17.3. CONCLUSION: The nurses' perception of the hospitals' culture and readiness score for system-wide integration of evidence-based practice in six hospitals in Western Ethiopia was equivocal. There is a need to engage all resources and increase leadership commitment to make evidence-based practice a hospital culture. Further research is warranted to understand the national hospitals' status in establishing and sustaining evidence-based practise culture.",0
Women's preferences for less active ectopic pregnancy treatment: A discrete choice experiment.,"RESEARCH QUESTION: Shared decision-making has become a hallmark of quality care and is increasingly spotlighted in practice guidelines. Little is known about women's views for treatment of less active ectopic pregnancy. What are the preferences of women for less active ectopic pregnancy treatment-related attributes? DESIGN: A discrete choice model with 8 attributes depicting ectopic pregnancy treatment including varying levels of first-line treatment effectiveness, length of hospitalization, cost, length of sick leave, of convalescence, need for surgical management, for emergency care during convalescence and for tube removal was used. Childbearing aged women, i.e. those who might experience an ectopic pregnancy in the future, were recruited. They were asked to choose between hypothetical treatments in 18 choice tasks with different levels of all treatment attributes. A conditional logit McFadden's choice model was performed. The main outcome measure was preference weights for less active ectopic pregnancy treatment-related attributes. RESULTS: A total of 5770 observations from 178 women were analysed. The attributes displaying the highest marginal impacts on women's decisions included: higher rate of first-line treatment effectiveness, lower rate of tube removal, lower rate of surgical management, shorter length of hospitalization and, to a lesser extent, but still significant, shorter length of convalescence, absence of risk of emergency care during convalescence and lower cost. CONCLUSIONS: Trade-offs made by women between the attributes of less active ectopic pregnancy treatment suggest that no treatment option, either medical or surgical, is an obvious preferred option. These results encourage the promotion of shared decision-making.",1
Preferences of Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis for Intrathecal Drug Delivery: Choosing between an Implanted Drug-Delivery Device and Therapeutic Lumbar Puncture.,"BACKGROUND: Novel intrathecal treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may require delivery using lumbar puncture (LP). Implanted drug-delivery devices (IDDDs) could be an alternative but little is known about patients' preferences for intrathecal drug-delivery methods. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to elicit preferences of patients with ALS for routine LP and IDDD use. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) and a threshold technique (TT) exercise were conducted online among patients with ALS in the US and Europe. In the DCE, patients made trade-offs between administration attributes. Attributes were identified from qualitative interviews. The TT elicited maximum acceptable risks (MARs) of complications from device implantation surgery. DCE data were analyzed using mixed logit to quantify relative attribute importance (RAI) as the maximum contribution of each attribute to a preference, and to estimate MARs of device failure. TT data were analyzed using interval regression. Four scenarios of LP and IDDD were compared. RESULTS: Participants (N = 295) had a mean age of 57.7 years; most (74.2%) were diagnosed < 3 years ago. Preferences were affected by device failure risk (RAI 28.6%), administration frequency (26.4%), administration risk (19.7%), overall duration (17.8%), and appointment location (7.5%). Patients accepted a 5.6% device failure risk to reduce overall duration from 2 h to 30 min and a 3.6% risk for administration in a local clinic instead of a hospital. The average MAR of complications from implantation surgery was 29%. Patients preferred IDDD over LP in three of four scenarios. CONCLUSION: Patients considered an IDDD as a valuable alternative to LP in multiple clinical settings.",1
Prognostication for Patients Receiving Palliative Radiation Therapy.,"Estimation of patient prognosis plays a central role in guiding decision making for the palliative management of metastatic disease, and a number of statistical models have been developed to provide survival estimates for patients in this context. In this review, we discuss several well-validated survival prediction models for patients receiving palliative radiotherapy to sites outside of the brain. Key considerations include the type of statistical model, model performance measures and validation procedures, studies' source populations, time points used for prognostication, and details of model output. We then briefly discuss underutilization of these models, the role of decision support aids, and the need to incorporate patient preference in shared decision making for patients with metastatic disease who are candidates for palliative radiotherapy.",0
What are the Most Important Objectives of Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy? A Narrative Review.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate what objectives are most important to men undergoing radical prostatectomy to allow treating physicians to personalize perioperative counselling and improve patient quality of life outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A predefined search protocol of the Medline and Embase databases was performed from database inception to May 2023. The search was limited to English language and full text. All articles with a specific consideration of patient objectives, preferences or reasons for decision to undergo radical prostatectomy were included for review. RESULTS: Ten articles out of 375 screened met inclusion criteria for review. All 10 articles utilized a qualitative design and originated across 5 countries across the developed world. A common theme of men placing importance on having their tumor physically removed was found. Methodologies allowing free response beyond predefined categories identified a breadth of considerations including personal circumstance, personal belief and current function in the decision-making process. An investigation on radical prostatectomy performed robotically found some men placed preference on the quicker treatment time with surgery compared to radiation therapy, reflective of shorter recovery times with the robotic approach. CONCLUSION: Variability in results across studies highlights the heterogeneity in patient preferences. Directed investigation of patient objectives with an open-ended questioning approach would personalize the perioperative experience and may improve patient satisfaction and quality of life outcomes.",0
Comparing Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty and High Tibial Osteotomy for Isolated Medial Compartment Knee Osteoarthritis.,"»: Both unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) and high tibial osteotomy (HTO) allow for compartment-specific intervention on an arthritic knee joint that preserves bone stock and native soft tissue compared to a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Both operations give a more natural feeling with native proprioception compared with a TKA. »: HTO is better suited in patients who are younger (<55 years-of-age), have a body mass index (BMI) <30 kg/m2, high activity requirements, mechanical malalignment, asymmetric varus, isolated anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency, need for multiplanar correction, and a preference for joint preserving interventions. Recent data suggest that age (>55 years-of-age) should not solely contraindicate a HTO. »: UKA may be chosen in patients who are older (>55 years-of-age), low activity requirements, have a BMI <40 kg/m2, severe osteoarthritis with significant joint space narrowing, acceptable coronal alignment, symmetric varus, and patient preference for arthroplasty.",0
Interleukin-17A Inhibitors in Patients with Psoriasis and Tuberculosis Infection: A 2-Year Prospective Study on Safety Without Preventive Treatment.,"INTRODUCTION: The necessity for tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) and routine T-SPOT.TB monitoring in patients with psoriasis and tuberculosis infection (TBI) undergoing interleukin (IL)-17A inhibitor therapy remains uncertain. This study aims to evaluate the long-term safety of IL-17A inhibitors administered without TPT and analyze changes in T-SPOT.TB among these patients. It also identifies risk factors for TBI in patients with psoriasis. METHODS: This single-center prospective study enrolled adult patients with plaque psoriasis and TBI receiving IL-17A inhibitors. TBI was defined as positive T-SPOT.TB results (≥ 6 spots) without symptoms or evidence of active tuberculosis (ATB). TPT administration was based on contraindications, tuberculosis risk factors, and patient preferences. The primary endpoint was the incidence of ATB over 2 years. Secondary outcomes included T-SPOT.TB changes and TBI risk factors. RESULTS: Of the 129 patients with psoriasis and TBI enrolled in the study, 97 (75.2%) did not receive TPT, while 32 (24.8%) did. Among them, 109 patients (84.5%) completed the 2-year follow-up. During the 235 person-years of observation, no ATB cases were identified. Median T-SPOT.TB values showed no significant changes from baseline to year 2 in both the non-TPT (20 vs. 17 spots, p = 0.975) and TPT groups (55 vs. 58 spots, p = 0.830). T-SPOT.TB reversed in 14 patients (12.8%), mostly in the non-TPT group. Moreover, for TBI risk factor analysis, a cohort of 212 patients with psoriasis with negative baseline T-SPOT.TB was evaluated, revealing a TBI prevalence of 37.8%. Logistic regression analysis highlighted age ≥ 45 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.50-3.99, p < 0.001) and body mass index (BMI) < 24.0 kg/m(2) (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.27-3.54, p = 0.004) as independent risk factors for TBI. CONCLUSION: IL-17A inhibitors do not appear to reactivate tuberculosis in patients with psoriasis and TBI, potentially reducing the need for routine TBI screening and preventive treatment.

"An Online Decision Aid for Patients With Metastatic Melanoma—Results of the Randomized Controlled Trial ""PEF-Immun"".","BACKGROUND: Treatment decisions in metastatic melanoma (MM) depend on patient preferences and require the patients' involvement in the decision-making process. Patients often feel overwhelmed by the complexity of treatment options with their individual advantages and disadvantages. We developed an online patient decision aid (PtDA) to facilitate shared decision making (SDM). METHODS: We conducted a two-center, two-armed, prospective, open randomized controlled trial with MM patients who were facing a decision about first-line treatment. They were randomly allotted (1:1) to the use or non-use of the PtDA before discussing the choice of treatment with a physician (intervention group [IG] and control group [CG], respectively). The primary endpoint of the study was patient knowledge about first-line treatment options (multiple-choice test, 10 items, range 0-40 points). The secondary endpoints were the degree of SDM (ratings of audio recordings of the patient-physician discussions by third-party observers) and satisfaction with the decision that was taken on later follow-up. RESULTS: 120 of the 128 randomized patients completed the baseline questionnaire and were included in the analysis (59% male, median age 66 years). The primary endpoint, i.e., the mean difference in knowledge after discussion with a physician, was significantly higher in the intervention group (mean difference -3.22, 95% CI [-6.32;-0.12], p = 0.042). No difference was found in either of the secondary endpoints (SDM and satisfaction with the decision). The patients in the intervention group rated the PtDA as very useful. CONCLUSION: PtDA improved MM patients' knowledge about their options for treatment. Both patients who used it and patients who did not were highly satisfied with their treatment decisions. Additional physician training seems necessary to promote SDM.",0
Evaluation of post-operative surveillance strategies and surgeon perceptions and beliefs of surveillance for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in the UK.,"BACKGROUND: Despite high rates of recurrence after surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) there is lack of standardised surveillance practices. We aimed to identify UK surveillance practice and interrogate surgeon beliefs around surveillance. METHODS: A web-based survey was sent to all UK pancreatic units to assess surveillance practice for resected PDAC, factors influencing surveillance protocols, and perceptions and beliefs surrounding on current postoperative surveillance. RESULTS: There was wide variation in reported practice between 40 consultant surgeons from 28 pancreatic units (100% unit response rate). 26% had standardised surveillance compared to 18% with no standardised practice. 16% individualised surveillance to the patient, and 40% reported differing practices between surgeons within units despite local surveillance protocols. 66% felt surveillance should be tailored to patient factors, and 58% to patient preference. There was a broad belief regarding a lack of robust evidence supporting surveillance making a trial necessary. Thematic analysis identified surveillance barriers, considerations for trial design, necessity for patient engagement and potential benefits of surveillance. DISCUSSION: Wide variation in surveillance practice exists within and between units. A surveillance trial was deemed beneficial, however identified barriers potentially preclude a trial. Future work should assess acceptability for patients including impact on anxiety and quality-of-life.",0
Abdominal Hysterectomy.,"Abdominal hysterectomy was first performed in 1843. Prior attempts at removal of the uterus date back to ancient times, when vaginal hysterectomy was performed to treat uterine prolapse or inversion. Laparoscopic assistance was used to facilitate minimally invasive hysterectomy in 1989 and further advanced in 2005 with the approval of the robotic-assisted technique. Today, abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and a combination of vaginal and laparoscopic techniques are utilized for hysterectomy. The surgical approach to hysterectomy depends on the clinical indication, the technical experience of the surgeon, the resources available, the general health condition of the patient, and patient preference. An abdominal hysterectomy involves the removal of the uterus through an incision in the abdominal wall. As minimally invasive techniques have become more available, the rates of abdominal hysterectomy have declined since the less invasive approaches offer benefits such as less post-operative pain, expedited recovery times, and better short-term quality of life after surgery, as well as shorter hospitalization stays and reduced costs. Furthermore, the use of hysterectomy, in general, has decreased as alternatives to hysterectomy continue to gain favor, such as endometrial ablation for symptomatic uterine bleeding and uterine artery embolization for uterine leiomyomas. Still, hysterectomy remains the most appropriate management option for many patients. Large uterine size has been cited as a common reason for choosing the abdominal approach to hysterectomy, as it has been thought that an enlarged uterus may require better visualization and exposure due to higher risks of blood loss, injury to neighboring viscera, and prolonged operating times. However, there are no specific recommendations up to which uterine weight or size should qualify a patient for abdominal hysterectomy, and studies have shown that minimally invasive techniques, such as laparoscopy, can safely remove larger uteri. Despite these findings, abdominal hysterectomy remains a common route of surgery being most commonly indicated for uterine fibroids, followed by abnormal uterine bleeding, prolapse, and endometriosis.",0
In-office needle arthroscopy is a cost-effective alternative for operating room diversion in medial meniscectomy: a financial analysis.,"BACKGROUND: In-office needle arthroscopy (IONA) has been described as a diagnostic alternative to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for intra-articular pathology. However, few studies have analyzed its impact on cost and wait times when used as a therapeutic intervention. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact on cost and wait times associated with offering IONA for partial medial meniscectomy as an alternative to traditional operating room (OR) arthroscopy for patients with irreparable medial meniscus tears on MRI. METHODS: Two models were created comparing the existing care pathway (current state) to a proposed future state utilizing IONA. Data sources were accounting data from an academically affiliated hospital in Canada and supplemented with literature values. A Monte Carlo simulation combined with DuPont analysis running 10,000 simulations was conducted to calculate the revenue, expenses, profits, and effect on surgical waitlists (i.e., throughput) between the states. Sensitivity analyses examined the influence of patient preference and revision rates on profit and throughput. Two-sample Student's t test was performed (p < .05). RESULTS: An average of 198 (standard deviation (SD) 31) patients underwent arthroscopic meniscectomy or repair each year from 2016 to 2020. The IONA revision rate was calculated as 20.3%. Compared to the current state, annual expenses in the IONA pathway were significantly reduced ($266,912.68 versus $281,415.23, p < .0001), while improving throughput by 21.2% (3.54%). Sensitivity analysis revealed 10% of patients need to select IONA over traditional OR arthroscopy with the revision rate remaining below 40% for the proposed state profit to be higher than the current state. CONCLUSIONS: IONA is a cost-effective alternative to traditional OR arthroscopy in patients undergoing partial medial meniscectomy. The next steps are to assess patients' perceptions of IONA as an alternative to traditional OR arthroscopy, and to carry out clinical trials to determine the efficacy, patient-reported outcome metrics, and complications of IONA.",0
Patient-related outcomes and Oral Health-Related Quality of Life in endodontics.,"There is increased interest in outcome measures that complement the classic goal of endodontics, being the prevention and healing of apical periodontitis. Possible outcome measures can be subdivided into patient-centred outcomes (PCOs), encompassing data collected by nonpatients aiming to assess the effectiveness of an intervention and patient-reported outcomes (PROs), which are reported directly by the patient. PROs can be subsequently classed into PRO measures that ascertain patients' view of their symptoms, their functional status, and their health-related quality of life, and patient-reported experience measures that focus on aspects including the humanity of care, patient satisfaction, patient preference and adherence, personal costs, expectation fulfilment, and decision regrets. The present review aims to define various patient-related outcomes and discuss the literature available regarding PCOs and PROs in endodontics. This includes those proposed to assess the effectiveness of endodontic treatment for pulpitis and apical periodontitis for use in the development of European Society of Endodontology S3-level clinical practice guidelines that have been included by all working groups, except for the radiographic assessment of apical periodontitis. Based on limited evidence in the field, it can be summarized that after recall periods of various lengths, endodontic treatment is associated with a high likelihood of tooth survival and limited need for further intervention, including extraction and further restorative procedures. Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) is likely to improve following the completion of treatment. Nonetheless, the literature assessing the association between OHRQoL and endodontics is hampered by the use of instruments that have not been previously validated. Amongst the remaining outcome measures discussed in the present review, it is worth highlighting that there is only one study assessing exacerbations in teeth with the presence of endodontic pathosis, which suggests a very low incidence of this adverse effect following endodontic treatment. Patients' expectation fulfilment, adherence, and satisfaction are closely inter-related and depend also on various nonclinical factors. Further studies assessing PCOs and PROs, in association with healing and prevention of apical periodontitis, are required to better understand endodontic treatment from the perspective of patients.",0
Achalasia: Current therapeutic options.,"Achalasia is an esophageal motor disorder characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and absent peristalsis in the smooth muscle esophageal body. As a result, patients typically experience dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss. Over the past 10-15 years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the evaluation of therapies for achalasia. Unfortunately, little progress in the development of effective pharmacological treatments has been made. Botulinum toxin injection provides some relief of symptoms in many patients but requires periodic reinjection that may provide progressively less benefit over time. There are now three well-established, safe, and effective therapies for the treatment of achalasia: pneumatic dilation (PD), laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM), and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) which can lead to marked symptom improvement in most patients. Each treatment has a specific constellation of risks, benefits, and recurrence rate. The first-line treatment used will depend on patient preference, achalasia subtype, and local expertise. The recent impressive advances in both the art and science of achalasia therapy are explored with a comprehensive review of the various treatment modalities and comparative controlled clinical trials. In addition, key technical pearls of the procedural treatments are demonstrated.",0
Comparing Discrete Choice Experiment with Swing Weighting to Estimate Attribute Relative Importance: A Case Study in Lung Cancer Patient Preferences.,"INTRODUCTION: Discrete choice experiments (DCE) are commonly used to elicit patient preferences and to determine the relative importance of attributes but can be complex and costly to administer. Simpler methods that measure relative importance exist, such as swing weighting with direct rating (SW-DR), but there is little empirical evidence comparing the two. This study aimed to directly compare attribute relative importance rankings and weights elicited using a DCE and SW-DR. METHODS: A total of 307 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer in Italy and Belgium completed an online survey assessing preferences for cancer treatment using DCE and SW-DR. The relative importance of the attributes was determined using a random parameter logit model for the DCE and rank order centroid method (ROC) for SW-DR. Differences in relative importance ranking and weights between the methods were assessed using Cohen's weighted kappa and Dirichlet regression. Feedback on ease of understanding and answering the 2 tasks was also collected. RESULTS: Most respondents (>65%) found both tasks (very) easy to understand and answer. The same attribute, survival, was ranked most important irrespective of the methods applied. The overall ranking of the attributes on an aggregate level differed significantly between DCE and SW-ROC (P < 0.01). Greater differences in attribute weights between attributes were reported in DCE compared with SW-DR (P < 0.01). Agreement between the individual-level attribute ranking across methods was moderate (weighted Kappa 0.53-0.55). CONCLUSION: Significant differences in attribute importance between DCE and SW-DR were found. Respondents reported both methods being relatively easy to understand and answer. Further studies confirming these findings are warranted. Such studies will help to provide accurate guidance for methods selection when studying relative attribute importance across a wide array of preference-relevant decisions. HIGHLIGHTS: Both DCEs and SW tasks can be used to determine attribute relative importance rankings and weights; however, little evidence exists empirically comparing these methods in terms of outcomes or respondent usability.Most respondents found the DCE and SW tasks very easy or easy to understand and answer.A direct comparison of DCE and SW found significant differences in attribute importance rankings and weights as well as a greater spread in the DCE-derived attribute relative importance weights.",1
Delivering Prognostic News to Older People with Chronic Disease: What Format Preference and Level of Involvement in Decision Making? A Hospital Survey.,"Shared decision making near end of life is a balancing act of communicating prognosis to patients and their surrogates/families and engaging them in considering value-concordant management choices. This cross-sectional survey aimed to determine the format in which older patients with chronic illnesses would prefer to receive prognostic information on their treatment options and disease progression, and their desired level of engagement in decision making. With a 60% participation rate, 139 inpatients in two hospitals and five surrogates were presented with six hypothetical scenarios with a randomly assigned sequence: verbal and written summary, graph, table, photo, video, and pamphlet. The majority (76%) of respondents chose the traditional verbal communication of prognosis by their doctor with a written summary as a reference and to share with family; the second choice was a condition-specific pamphlet (63%). Many found the graph and photo to be distressing (36% and 42%, respectively). Most (71%) wanted to know everything about their condition trajectory, and 63% chose shared decision making rather than completely autonomous or full delegation to clinicians or family. There were no gender differentials between wanting to know it all, supporting shared decision making or the preferred format for breaking news (p > 0.05). Older hospitalized patients with chronic conditions are willing to discuss end-of-life issues, learn about their prognosis, and be involved in shared decision making. Innovative formats such as graphs, videos, or photos were not welcome as part of the prognostic discussion.",0
Rural patient and provider perceptions of telehealth implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding perceptions of telehealth  implementation from patients and providers can improve the utility and sustainability of these programs, particularly in under-resourced rural settings. The purpose of this study was to evaluate both patient and provider perceptions of telehealth visits in a large rural healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic. To promote sustainability of telehealth approaches, we also assessed whether the percentage of missed appointments differed between in-person and telehealth visits. METHODS: Using anonymous surveys, we evaluated patient preferences and satisfaction with telehealth visits from November 2020 -March 2021 and assessed perceptions of telehealth efficiency and value among rural providers from September-October 2020. We examined whether telehealth perceptions differed according to patients' age, educational attainment, insurance status, and distance to clinical site and providers' age and length of time practicing medicine using ANOVA test. We also examined whether the percentage of missed appointments differed between in-person and telehealth visits at a family practice clinic within the rural healthcare system from April to September 2020 using a Chi-square test. RESULTS: Over 73% of rural patients had favorable perceptions of telehealth visits, and satisfaction was generally higher among younger patients. Patients reported difficulty with scheduling follow-up appointments, lack of personal contact and technology challenges as common barriers. Over 80% of the 219 providers responding to the survey reported that telehealth added value to their practice, while 36.6% agreed that telehealth visits are more efficient than in-person visits. Perception of telehealth value and efficiency did not differ by provider age (p = 0.67 and p = 0.67, respectively) or time in practice (p = 0.53 and p = 0.44, respectively). Technology challenges for the patient (91.3%) and provider (45.1%) were commonly reported. The percentage of missed appointments was slightly higher for telehealth visits compared to in-person visits, but the difference was not statistically significant (8.7% vs. 8.0%; p = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth perceptions were generally favorable among rural patients and providers, although satisfaction was lower among older patients and providers. Our findings suggest that telehealth approaches may add value and efficiency to rural clinical practice. However, technology issues for both patients and providers and gaps in care coordination need to be addressed to promote sustainability of telehealth approaches in rural practice.",0
CAPER: patient preferences to inform nonsurgical treatment of chronic low back pain: a discrete-choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVE: We developed and used a discrete-choice measure to study patient preferences with regard to the risks and benefits of nonsurgical treatments when they are making treatment selections for chronic low back pain. METHODS: ""CAPER TREATMENT"" (Leslie Wilson) was developed with standard choice-based conjoint procedures (discrete-choice methodology that mimics an individual's decision-making process). After expert input and pilot testing, our final measure had 7 attributes (chance of pain relief, duration of relief, physical activity changes, treatment method, treatment type, treatment time burden, and risks of treatment) with 3-4 levels each. Using Sawtooth software (Sawtooth Software, Inc., Provo, UT, USA), we created a random, full-profile, balanced-overlap experimental design. Respondents (n = 211) were recruited via an emailed online link and completed 14 choice-based conjoint choice pairs; 2 fixed questions; and demographic, clinical, and quality-of-life questions. Analysis was performed with random-parameters multinomial logit with 1000 Halton draws. RESULTS: Patients cared most about the chance of pain relief, followed closely by improving physical activity, even more than duration of pain relief. There was comparatively less concern about time commitment and risks. Gender and socioeconomic status influenced preferences, especially with relation to strength of expectations for outcomes. Patients experiencing a low level of pain (Pain, Enjoyment, and General Activity Scale [PEG], question 1, numeric rating scale score<4) had a stronger desire for maximally improved physical activity, whereas those in a high level of pain (PEG, question 1, numeric rating scale score>6) preferred both maximum and more limited activity. Highly disabled patients (Oswestry Disability Index score>40) demonstrated distinctly different preferences, placing more weight on achieving pain control and less on improving physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with chronic low back pain were willing to trade risks and inconveniences for better pain control and physical activity. Additionally, different preference phenotypes exist, which suggests a need for clinicians to target treatments to particular patients.",1

How can we elicit health workers' preferences for measures to reduce informal payments? A mixed methods approach to developing a discrete choice experiment in Tanzania.,"OBJECTIVE: While discrete choice experiments (DCEs) have been used in other fields as a means of eliciting respondent preferences, these remain relatively new in studying corrupt practices in the health sector. This study documents and discusses the process of developing a DCE to inform policy measures aimed at addressing informal payments for healthcare in Tanzania. DESIGN: A mixed methods design was used to systematically develop attributes for the DCE. It involved five stages: a scoping literature review, qualitative interviews, a workshop with health providers and managers, expert review and a pilot study. SETTING: Dar es Salaam and Pwani regions in Tanzania. PARTICIPANTS: Health workers and health managers. RESULTS: A large number of factors were identified as driving informal payments in Tanzania and thus represent potential areas for policy intervention. Through iterative process involving different methods (qualitative and quantitative) and seeking consensus views by diverse actors, we derived six attributes for a DCE: mode of payment, supervision at the facility level, opportunity for private practice, awareness and monitoring, disciplinary measures against informal payments and incentive payment for staff if a facility has less informal payments. 12 choice sets were generated and piloted with 15 health workers from 9 health facilities. The pilot study revealed that respondents could easily understand the attributes and levels, answered all the choice sets and appeared to be trading between the attributes. The results from the pilot study had expected signs for all attributes. CONCLUSIONS: We elicited attributes and levels for a DCE to identify the acceptability and preferences of potential policy interventions to address informal payments in Tanzania through a mixed-methods approach. We argue that more attention is needed to the process of defining attributes for the DCE, which needs to be rigorous and transparent in order to derive reliable and policy-relevant findings.",1
Eliciting preferences of persons with dementia and informal caregivers to support ageing in place in the Netherlands: a protocol for a discrete choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Ageing in place (AIP) for persons with dementia is encouraged by European governments and societies. Healthcare packages may need reassessment to account for the preferences of care funders, patients and informal caregivers. By providing insight into people's preferences, discrete choice experiments (DCEs) can help develop consensus between stakeholders. This protocol paper outlines the development of a Dutch national study to cocreate a healthcare package design methodology built on DCEs that is person-centred and helps support informal caregivers and persons with dementia to AIP. A subpopulation analysis of persons with dementia with a migration background is planned due to their high risk for dementia and under-representation in research and care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The DCE is designed to understand how persons with dementia and informal caregivers choose between different healthcare packages. Qualitative methods are used to identify and prioritise important care components for persons with dementia to AIP. This will provide a list of care components that will be included in the DCE, to quantify the care needs and preferences of persons with dementia and informal caregivers. The DCE will identify individual and joint preferences to AIP. The relative importance of each attribute will be calculated. The DCE data will be analysed with the use of a random parameters logit model. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was waived by the Amsterdam University Medical Center (W23_112 #23.137). A study summary will be available on the websites of Alzheimer Nederland, Pharos and Amsterdam Public Health institute. Results are expected to be presented at (inter)national conferences, peer-reviewed papers will be submitted, and a dissemination meeting will be held to bring stakeholders together. The study results will help improve healthcare package design for all stakeholders.",1
Shared Decision Making and the Management of Intact Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Scoping Review of the Literature.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to summarise the current knowledge of shared decision making (SDM) in patients facing a treatment decision about an intact abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and to identify where further evidence is needed. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched on 18 July 2021. An updated search was run on 31 May 2022 for relevant studies published from 1 January 2000 to 31 May 2022. REVIEW METHODS: This scoping review was undertaken in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines following a pre-defined protocol, retrieving studies reporting on aspects of SDM in those with intact AAAs. Qualitative synthesis of the articles was performed, and the results grouped according to theme. RESULTS: Fifteen articles reporting on a total of 1 344 participants (age range 62-74 years) from hospital vascular surgery clinics with intact AAAs were included. Studies were observational (n = 9), non-randomised studies of an intervention (n = 3), and randomised clinical trials (n = 3). The first theme was the preferences and practice of SDM. The proportion of patients preferring SDM ranged from 58% to 95% (three studies), although objective rating of SDM practice was consistently < 50% (three studies). Clinician training improved SDM practice. The second theme was poor provision of information. Fewer than half of patients (0 - 46%) surveyed were informed about all available treatment options (three studies). Publicly available information sources were rated as poor. The third theme concerned the utility of decision making support tools (DSTs). Two randomised trials demonstrated that the provision of DSTs improves patient knowledge and agreement between patient preference and repair type received but not objective measures of SDM for patients with AAAs. CONCLUSION: SDM for patients with an intact AAA appears to be in its infancy. Most patients with an AAA want SDM, but this is not commonly applied. Most patients with an AAA do not receive adequate information for SDM, although the use of bespoke DSTs leaves patients better informed to facilitate SDM.",1
"Patient-reported health-related quality of life outcomes following mastectomy for breast cancer, with immediate, delayed or no breast reconstruction: Four-year follow-up from a prospective cohort study.","BACKGROUND: Breast reconstruction (BR) improves women's health-related quality of life (HRQOL) following mastectomy for breast cancer, yet factors contributing to improved HRQOL remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the overall impact of mastectomy with or without BR on participants' perceptions of HRQOL over time in a cohort of women with high-risk breast cancer; to examine differences in mean HRQOL scores between immediate BR, delayed BR and no BR groups; to assess the influence of patient characteristics potentially associated with HRQOL scores; and to determine the feasibility of long-term collection of patient-reported outcome measures in clinical settings. METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal study of 100 women with high-risk breast cancer who underwent mastectomy with or without breast reconstruction and were likely to require post-mastectomy radiotherapy. Four validated patient-reported questionnaires, comprising 21 outcome measures relating to HRQOL, administered at baseline and up to 4 years post-mastectomy. Demographic, clinical and surgical data extracted from patient medical records. RESULTS: Consistently significant declines in perceptions of future health and arm symptoms, consistently significant improvements in treatment side effects, breast symptoms and fatigue, as well as significant improvements, compared to baseline, in social functioning and financial difficulties at 48 months. No significant differences in mean HRQOL scores between women given a choice of reconstructive options. CONCLUSION: Similar trajectories of HRQOL scores were found in women with high-risk breast cancer who were offered a choice of BR. Informed choice may be an independent contributing factor in long-term maintenance of most HRQOL indicators at their pre-mastectomy levels.",0
Refusal of Retreatment With Topical 5-Fluorouracil Among Patients With Actinic Keratosis: Qualitative Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Actinic keratosis (AK) is a common premalignant skin lesion, and topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is commonly used in field-directed therapy. However, 5-FU is associated with frequent local skin reactions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to qualitatively assess experiences among patients with AK who refuse retreatment with 5-FU. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 adult participants who had received treatment with 5-FU for AK between January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2020, and refused future treatment with 5-FU. Results were analyzed using qualitative research methods. RESULTS: Although most participants had low concern upon having received a diagnosis of AK, most felt that treatment is very important. When initiating treatment with 5-FU, most cited recommendation by their health care professionals as the primary motivator and initially had low concern regarding treatment. The side effects associated with treatment were physically and psychosocially burdensome for most participants and led to temporary lifestyle adjustments. After treatment, most did not believe that their health care provider prepared them for treatment or were unsure. While half of the participants felt that 5-FU helped treat AKs, half were either unsure, due to premature discontinuation, or did not think that 5-FU treated their AKs. CONCLUSIONS: 5-FU is one of the most commonly prescribed treatments for AKs, yet most patients experienced both a physical and psychosocial burden with the treatment. Inability to assess efficacy due to premature discontinuation secondary to 5-FU-related reactions is common, and shared decision-making, navigating treatment options, and taking into account patient preferences may be critical to help assure better adherence and outcomes. Although our study was limited by input from participants who refused future treatment with 5-FU, most stated that they would still continue to seek treatment for AKs in the future and would consider other topical treatments, especially if associated with a milder tolerability profile.",0
Impact of the Breast Cancer Index for Extended Endocrine Decision-Making: First Results of the Prospective BCI Registry Study.,"BACKGROUND: The Breast Cancer Index (BCI) test assay provides an individualized risk of late distant recurrence (5-10 years) and predicts the likelihood of benefitting from extended endocrine therapy (EET) in hormone receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer. This analysis aimed to assess the impact of BCI on EET decision-making in current clinical practice. METHODS: The BCI Registry study evaluates long-term outcomes, decision impact, and medication adherence in patients receiving BCI testing as part of routine clinical care. Physicians and patients completed pre-BCI and post-BCI test questionnaires to assess a range of questions, including physician decision-making and confidence regarding EET; patient preferences and concerns about the cost, side effects, drug safety, and benefit of EET; and patient satisfaction regarding treatment recommendations. Pre-BCI and post-BCI test responses were compared using McNemar's test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: Pre-BCI and post-BCI questionnaires were completed for 843 physicians and 823 patients. The mean age at enrollment was 65 years, and 88.4% of patients were postmenopausal. Of the tumors, 74.7% were T1, 53.4% were grade 2, 76.0% were N0, and 13.8% were HER2-positive. Following BCI testing, physicians changed EET recommendations in 40.1% of patients (P<.0001), and 45.1% of patients changed their preferences for EET (P<.0001). In addition, 38.8% of physicians felt more confident in their recommendation (P<.0001), and 41.4% of patients felt more comfortable with their EET decision (P<.0001). Compared with baseline, significantly more patients were less concerned about the cost (20.9%; P<.0001), drug safety (25.4%; P=.0014), and benefit of EET (29.3%; P=.0002). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis in a large patient cohort of the BCI Registry confirms and extends previous findings on the significant decision-making impact of BCI on EET. Incorporating BCI into clinical practice resulted in changes in physician recommendations, increased physician confidence, improved patient satisfaction, and reduced patient concerns regarding the cost, drug safety, and benefit of EET.",0
Comparing adalimumab and infliximab in the prevention of postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a relapsing disease that often requires operative management. Prevention of postoperative recurrence (POR) is critical to maintain remissions. Biologic agents have proven to be most successful in remission maintenance. We made a direct head-to-head comparison of the 2 anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADA), to compare endoscopic and clinical POR of Crohn's disease. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search in 7 databases, including Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science Core Collection, KCI-Korean Journal Index, SciELO, and Global Index Medicus. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and P-values (<0.05 considered significant). We evaluated the total rates of endoscopic recurrence, endoscopic recurrence at 1 year, and clinical recurrence rates of IFX and ADA in a direct head-to-head comparison. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded a total of 393 articles. Three studies with a total of 268 participants were included. Our meta-analysis showed no statistically significant difference in total endoscopic recurrence rate between ADA and IFX (27.1% vs. 32.3%, OR 0.696, 95%CI 0.403-1.201; P=0.193; I (2)=0%). Nor was there any significant difference between the drugs in endoscopic recurrence rate at 1 year (OR 0.799, 95%CI 0.329-1.940; P=0.620) or clinical recurrence rate (OR 0.477, 95%CI 0.477-1.712; P=0.755). CONCLUSIONS: ADA and IFX show comparable efficacy in preventing POR endoscopically and clinically. The clinical decision should be based on cost, side-effects, tolerability, and patient preferences. Additional studies, particularly randomized controlled trials, are needed to determine generalizability.",0
"Racial, Ethnic, and Socioeconomic Disparities in Out-of-Hospital Pain Management for Patients With Long Bone Fractures.","STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate racial and ethnic disparities in out-of-hospital analgesic administration, accounting for the influence of clinical characteristics and community socioeconomic vulnerability, among a national cohort of patients with long bone fractures. METHODS: Using the 2019-2020 ESO Data Collaborative, we retrospectively analyzed emergency medical services (EMS) records for 9-1-1 advanced life support transport of adult patients diagnosed with long bone fractures at the emergency department. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for out-of-hospital analgesic administration by race and ethnicity, accounting for age, sex, insurance, fracture location, transport time, pain severity, and scene Social Vulnerability Index. We reviewed a random sample of EMS narratives without analgesic administration to identify whether other clinical factors or patient preferences could explain differences in analgesic administration by race and ethnicity. RESULTS: Among 35,711 patients transported by 400 EMS agencies, 81% were White, non-Hispanic, 10% were Black, non-Hispanic, and 7% were Hispanic. In crude analyses, Black, non-Hispanic patients with severe pain were less likely to receive analgesics compared with White, non-Hispanic patients (59% versus 72%; Risk Difference: -12.5%, 95% CI: -15.8% to -9.9%). After adjustment, Black, non-Hispanic patients remained less likely to receive analgesics compared with White, non-Hispanic patients (aOR:0.65, 95% CI:0.53 to 0.79). Narrative review identified similar rates of patients declining analgesics offered by EMS and analgesic contraindications across racial and ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among EMS patients with long bone fractures, Black, non-Hispanic patients were substantially less likely to receive out-of-hospital analgesics compared with White, non-Hispanic patients. These disparities were not explained by differences in clinical presentations, patient preferences, or community socioeconomic conditions.",0
Preferences for first-line treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma among US practicing oncologists and patients.,"Aim: Investigate oncologist and patient preferences for the first-line treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma. Materials & methods: A discrete-choice experiment was used to elicit treatment attribute preferences, including patient treatment experience (number and duration of treatments and grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events), overall survival and treatment administration frequency. Results: The study included 151 eligible medical oncologists and 150 patients with urothelial carcinoma. Both physicians and patients appeared to prefer treatment attributes related to overall survival, treatment-related adverse events and the number and duration of the medications in a regimen over frequency of administration. Overall survival had the most influence in driving oncologists' treatment preferences, followed by the patient's treatment experience. Patients found the treatment experience the most important attribute when considering options, followed by overall survival. Conclusion: Patient preferences were based on treatment experience, while oncologists preferred treatments that prolong overall survival. These results help to direct clinical conversations, treatment recommendations and clinical guideline development.",1
Radiotherapy Use in Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer: Review of the Guidelines and Impact of Increased Awareness in Patient Referral at a Tertiary Center in Belgium.,"PURPOSE: Pronounced underuse of radiotherapy (RT) in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is reported. This study aims to assess the awareness about the role of RT in different MIBC settings and see whether this has increased since 2017. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the bladder cancer guidelines of the EAU, ESMO, NCCN, NICE, and AUA/ASCO/ASTRO/SUO, focusing on the role of RT in MIBC. In 2017, we evaluated the use of RT in MIBC in Belgium. This raised awareness about the indications of RT in different MIBC settings. Here, we present a retrospective pattern of care analysis of the RT use for MIBC patients at our center from January 2012 until December 2021. Frequency of RT use, patient, disease and treatment characteristics were compared between two 5-year periods (2012-2016 and 2017-2021). RESULTS: Review of the guidelines suggested that RT can be used as a treatment option in most MIBC settings. However, differences between guideline recommendations existed and high-level evidence was often lacking. Overall, 221 unique MIBC patients received RT at our center. RT use for MIBC was 39% higher in the second 5-year period (Between the same periods, the number of new MIBC registrations increased with 26%). The most pronounced increase, ie, 529%, was observed in the primary setting and was in parallel with patient preference becoming the main indication for RT. Participation in clinical trials seems to have had an important impact on the frequency of RT use in the adjuvant and metastatic setting. CONCLUSION: We provide a critical overview of the RT indications in MIBC as recommended by the international guidelines. Increased awareness about RT as a treatment option in MIBC seems to have an impact on the treatment choice in clinical practice, as was observed in our tertiary center.",0
Face-down positioning or posturing after pars plana vitrectomy for macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachments.,"BACKGROUND: A macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is one of the most common ophthalmic surgical emergencies and causes significant visual morbidity. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with gas tamponade is often performed to repair primary macula-involving RRDs with a high rate of anatomical retinal reattachment. It has been advocated by some ophthalmologists that face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade helps reduce postoperative retinal displacement. Retinal displacement can cause metamorphopsia and binocular diplopia. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review is to determine whether face-down positioning reduces the risk of retinal displacement following PPV and gas tamponade for primary macula-involving RRDs. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2022, Issue 11), MEDLINE (January 1946 to 28 November 2022), Embase.com (January 1947 to 28 November 2022), PubMed (1948 to 28 November 2022), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database (1982 to 28 November 2022), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search. We last searched the electronic databases on 28 November 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which face-down positioning was compared with no positioning or another form of positioning following PPV and gas tamponade for primary macula-involving RRDs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methodology and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for the prespecified outcomes using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three RCTs (369 eyes of 368 participants) that met the eligibility criteria. Two RCTs provided data on postoperative retinal displacement, one reported on postoperative distortion and quality of life outcomes, two on postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in logMAR, and two on postoperative ocular adverse events such as outer retinal folds. Study characteristics and risk of bias All the trials involved predominantly male participants (range: 68% to 72%). Only one trial provided race and ethnicity information, was registered on a trial registry, and reported funding sources. Using the RoB 2 tool, we assessed the risk of bias for proportion of eyes with retinal displacement, mean change in visual acuity, objective distortion scores, quality of life assessments, and ocular adverse events, with most domains judged to be at low risk of bias. Findings Immediate face-down positioning may result in a lower proportion of participants with postoperative retinal displacement compared with support-the-break positioning at six months (risk ratio [RR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54 to 0.99; 1 RCT; 239 eyes of 239 participants; very low certainty evidence). One study found no evidence of a difference in BCVA at three months when comparing postoperative face-up with face-down positioning with or without perfluorocarbon liquid (mean difference [MD] -0.03, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.02; I(2) = 0; 56 eyes of 56 participants; very low certainty evidence). Immediate face-down positioning appears to have little to no effect on postoperative distortion scores at week 26 (MD 1.80, 95% CI -1.92 to 5.52; 1 RCT; 219 eyes of 219 participants; very low certainty evidence) and postoperative quality of life assessment scores at week 26 (MD -1.80, 95% CI -5.52 to 1.92; 1 RCT; 217 eyes of 217 participants; very low certainty evidence). Adverse events One study that enrolled 262 participants with macula-involving RRDs suggested that immediate face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade may reduce the ocular adverse event of postoperative outer retinal folds at six months (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.90; 1 RCT; 262 eyes of 262 participants; very low certainty evidence) and binocular diplopia (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.90; 1 RCT; 262 eyes of 262 participants; very low certainty evidence) compared with support-the-break positioning. Immediate face-down positioning may increase the ocular adverse event of elevated intraocular pressure compared with support-the-break positioning (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.73; 1 RCT; 262 eyes of 262 participants; very low certainty evidence). Another study found no evidence of a difference in postoperative outer retinal folds when comparing face-down versus face-up positioning at one and three months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.02; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.28 to 3.61; 1 RCT; 56 eyes of 56 participants; very low certainty evidence). No studies reported non-ocular adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Very low certainty evidence suggests that immediate face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade may result in a reduction in postoperative retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia, but may increase the chance of postoperative raised intraocular pressure compared with support-the-break positioning at six months. We identified two ongoing trials that compare face-down positioning with face-up positioning following PPV and gas tamponade in participants with primary macula-involving RRDs, whose results may provide relevant evidence for our stated objectives. Future trials should be rigorously designed, and investigators should analyze outcome data appropriately and report adequate information to provide evidence of high certainty. Quality of life and patient preferences should be examined in addition to clinical and adverse event outcomes.",0
"Talking, not training, increased the accuracy of physicians' diagnosis of their patients' preferences for colon cancer screening.","OBJECTIVE: Identify if primary care physicians (PCPs) accurately understand patient preferences for colorectal cancer (CRC) testing, whether shared decision making (SDM) training improves understanding of patient preferences, and whether time spent discussing CRC testing improves understanding of patient preferences. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a trial comparing SDM training plus a reminder arm to a reminder alone arm. PCPs and their patients completed surveys after visits assessing whether they discussed CRC testing, patient testing preference, and time spent discussing CRC testing. We compared patient and PCP responses, calculating concordance between patient-physician dyads. Multilevel models tested for differences in preference concordance by arm or time discussing CRC. RESULTS: 382 PCP and patient survey dyads were identified. Most dyads agreed on whether CRC testing was discussed (82%). Only 52% of dyads agreed on the patient's preference. SDM training did not impact accuracy of PCPs preference diagnoses (55%v.48%,p = 0.22). PCPs were more likely to accurately diagnose patient's preferences when discussions occurred, regardless of length. CONCLUSION: Only half of PCPs accurately identified patient testing preferences. Training did not impact accuracy. Visits where CRC testing was discussed resulted in PCPs better understanding patient preferences. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: PCPs should take time to discuss testing and elicit patient preferences.",0
Preferences for Anaemia Treatment Attributes among Patients with Non-Dialysis-Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Information about patient preferences for the treatment of anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is scarce. Hence, our aim was to examine how patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD valued attributes of alternative hypothetical anaemia treatments. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in adult patients who reported a clinical diagnosis of CKD-related anaemia. Treatment attributes included mode and frequency of administration, need for iron supplementation, risk of gastrointestinal side effects, risk of major cardiovascular events and impact on energy levels (as defined by the vitality section of the SF-6D health index). Logit models were used to analyse patients' preferences. RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 200 patients in four countries. Patients preferred an oral mode of administration. Patients were willing to tolerate a 5.1% (95% CI 2.0-8.3%) increase in the risk of a major cardiovascular event and an 11.7% (95% CI 5.0-18.5%) increase in the risk of gastrointestinal side effects to switch from an at-home subcutaneous injection administered once every 2 weeks to an at-home oral pill administered three times a week. Patients were willing to tolerate a 20.3% (95% CI 15.0-25.6%) increase in the risk of gastrointestinal side effects and an 8.9% (95% CI 6.1-11.7%) increase in the risk of a major cardiovascular event to transition from 'Sometimes having a lot of energy' to 'Always having a lot of energy'. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD-related anaemia demonstrated clear treatment preferences and were willing to accept increased gastrointestinal or cardiovascular risks in exchange for more energy or an oral treatment.",1
Diabetes patient preferences for glucose-monitoring technologies: results from a discrete choice experiment in Poland and the Netherlands.,"INTRODUCTION: New glucose-monitoring technologies have different cost-benefit profiles compared with traditional finger-prick tests, resulting in a preference-sensitive situation for patients. This study aimed to assess the relative value adults with diabetes assign to device attributes in two countries. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults with type 1 or 2 diabetes from the Netherlands (n=226) and Poland (n=261) completed an online discrete choice experiment. Respondents choose between hypothetical glucose monitors described using seven attributes: precision, effort to check, number of finger pricks required, risk of skin irritation, information provided, alarm function and out-of-pocket costs. Panel mixed logit models were used to determine attribute relative importance and to calculate expected uptake rates and willingness to pay (WTP). RESULTS: The most important attribute for both countries was monthly out-of-pocket costs. Polish respondents were more likely than Dutch respondents to choose a glucose-monitoring device over a standard finger prick and had higher WTP for a device. Dutch respondents had higher WTP for device improvements in an effort to check and reduce the number of finger pricks a device requires. CONCLUSION: Costs are the primary concern of patients in both countries when choosing a glucose monitor and would likely hamper real-world uptake. The costs-benefit profiles of such devices should be critically reviewed.",1
"Preferences for innovations in healthcare delivery models in the Swiss elderly population: a latent class, choice modelling study.","BACKGROUND: With the increasing number of people affected by multiple chronic conditions, it is essential for public-health professionals to promote strategies addressing patient needs for coordinated care. We aim to explore preference heterogeneity for better-coordinated care delivery models in Swiss older adults, and identify profiles of individuals more open to healthcare reforms. METHODS: A DCE (discrete choice experiment) survey was developed online and on paper for the Swiss adults aged 50+, following best practice. To elicit preferences, we estimated a latent class model allowing grouping individuals with similar preferences into distinct classes, and examined what background characteristics contributed to specific class membership. RESULTS: The optimal model identified three classes with different openness to reforms. Class 1 (49%) members were concerned with premium increases and were in favour of integrated care structures with care managed by interprofessional teams. Individuals in class 2 (19%) were younger, open to reforms, and expressed the needs for radical changes within the Swiss healthcare system. Class 3 respondents (32%) were strongly reluctant to changes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study goes beyond average preferences and identifies three distinct population profiles, a majority open to reforms on specific aspects of care delivery, a smallest group in favour radical changes, and a third strongly against changes. Therefore, tailored approaches around healthcare reforms are needed, e.g. explaining the role of interprofessional teams in coordinating care, electronic health records and insurance premium variation.",1
Recruiting women with ductal carcinoma in situ to a randomised controlled trial: lessons from the LORIS study.,"BACKGROUND: The LOw RISk DCIS (LORIS) study was set up to compare conventional surgical treatment with active monitoring in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Recruitment to trials with a surveillance arm is known to be challenging, so strategies to maximise patient recruitment, aimed at both patients and recruiting centres, were implemented. METHODS: Women aged ≥ 46 years with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-high-grade DCIS were eligible for 1:1 randomisation to either surgery or active monitoring. Prior to randomisation, all eligible women were invited to complete: (1) the Clinical Trials Questionnaire (CTQ) examining reasons for or against participation, and (2) interviews exploring in depth opinions about the study information sheets and film. Women agreeing to randomisation completed validated questionnaires assessing health status, physical and mental health, and anxiety levels. Hospital site staff were invited to communication workshops and refresher site initiation visits to support recruitment. Their perspectives on LORIS recruitment were collected via surveys and interviews. RESULTS: Eighty percent (181/227) of eligible women agreed to be randomised. Over 40% of participants had high anxiety levels at baseline. On the CTQ, the most frequent most important reasons for accepting randomisation were altruism and belief that the trial offered the best treatment, whilst worries about randomisation and the influences of others were the most frequent most important reasons for declining. Most women found the study information provided clear and useful. Communication workshops for site staff improved knowledge and confidence but only about half said they themselves would join LORIS if eligible. The most common recruitment barriers identified by staff were low numbers of eligible patients and patient preference. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment to LORIS was challenging despite strategies aimed at both patients and site staff. Ensuring that recruiting staff support the study could improve recruitment in similar future trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN27544579, prospectively registered on 22 May 2014.",0
Disparities in Adult Patient Selection for Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in the United States: A Population-Level Study.,"Rationale: Disparities in patient selection for advanced therapeutics in health care have been identified in multiple studies, but it is unclear if disparities exist in patient selection for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a rapidly expanding critical care resource. Objectives: To determine if disparities exist in patient selection for ECMO based on sex, primary insurance, and median income of the patient's neighborhood. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study using the Nationwide Readmissions Database 2016-2019, we identified patients treated with mechanical ventilation (MV) and/or ECMO with billing codes. Patient sex, insurance, and income level for patients receiving ECMO were compared with the patients treated with MV only, and hierarchical logistic regression with the hospital as a random intercept was used to determine odds of receiving ECMO based on patient demographics. Results: We identified 2,170,752 MV hospitalizations with 18,725 cases of ECMO. Among patients treated with ECMO, 36.1% were female compared with 44.5% of patients treated with> MV only (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] for ECMO, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.75). Of patients treated with ECMO, 38.1% had private insurance compared with 17.4% of patients treated with MV only. Patients with Medicaid were less likely to receive ECMO than patients with private insurance (aOR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.52-0.57). Patients treated with ECMO were more likely to live in the highest-income neighborhoods compared with patients treated with MV only (25.1% vs. 17.3%). Patients living in the lowest-income neighborhoods were less likely to receive ECMO than those living in the highest-income neighborhoods (aOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.60-0.67). Conclusions: Significant disparities exist in patient selection for ECMO. Female patients, patients with Medicaid, and patients living in the lowest-income neighborhoods are less likely to be treated with ECMO. Despite possible unmeasured confounding, these findings were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses. On the basis of previous work describing disparities in other areas of health care, we speculate that limited access in some neighborhoods, restrictive/biased interhospital transfer practices, differences in patient preferences, and implicit provider bias may contribute to the observed differences. Future studies with more granular data are needed to identify and modify drivers of observed disparities.",0
Six month incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events among adults with HIV in northern Tanzania: a prospective observational study.,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to prospectively describe incident cardiovascular events among people living with HIV (PLWH) in northern Tanzania. Secondary aims of this study were to understand non-communicable disease care-seeking behaviour and patient preferences for cardiovascular care and education. DESIGN: A prospective observational study. SETTING: This study was conducted at the Majengo HIV Care and Treatment Clinic, an outpatient government-funded clinic in Moshi, Tanzania PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients presenting to an HIV clinic for routine care in northern Tanzania were enrolled from 1 September 2020 to 1 March 2021. INTERVENTIONS: At enrolment, participants completed a survey and a resting 12-lead ECG was obtained. At 6 month follow-up, a repeat survey regarding interim health events and repeat ECG was obtained. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Interim major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were defined by: self-reported interim stroke, self-reported hospitalisation for heart failure, self-reported interim myocardial infarction, interim myocardial infarction by ECG criteria (new pathologic Q waves in two contiguous leads) or death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). RESULTS: Of 500 enrolled participants, 477 (95.4%) completed 6 month follow-up and 3 (0.6%) died. Over the 6 month follow-up period, 11 MACE occurred (3 strokes, 6 myocardial infarctions, 1 heart failure hospitalisation and 1 cardiovascular death), resulting in an incidence rate of 4.58 MACE per 100 person-years. Of participants completing 6 month follow-up, 31 (6.5%) reported a new non-communicable disease diagnosis, including 23 (4.8%) with a new hypertension diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of MACE among PLWH in Tanzania is high. These findings are an important preliminary step in understanding the landscape of CVD among PLWH in Tanzania and highlight the need for interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk in this population.",0
Seborrheic keratosis.,"Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is the most common benign epidermal tumor in clinical dermatological practice. This review summarizes current knowledge about the clinical and histological appearance, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of SK. There are different subtypes of SK based on clinical presentation and histologic findings. Several factors, including age, genetic predisposition, and possibly also exposure to ultraviolet radiation, are thought to contribute to the development of SK. The lesions can occur on all areas of the body except for the palms and soles, but the most common sites are the face and upper trunk. The diagnosis is usually made clinically, and in some cases by dermatoscopy or histology. Many patients prefer to have the lesions removed for cosmetic reasons although there is no medical indication. Treatment options include surgical therapy, laser therapy, electrocautery, cryotherapy, and topical drug therapy, which is currently in development. Treatment should be individualized depending on the clinical picture and patient preference.",0
Humanistic and Economic Burden of IgA Nephropathy: Systematic Literature Reviews and Narrative Synthesis.,"BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is a progressive inflammatory kidney disease requiring long-term treatment to reduce the risk of progression to kidney failure. Here, we present two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) to identify and summarize literature reporting the humanistic and economic burden of IgAN. METHODS: Electronic literature databases (Ovid Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane) were searched for relevant literature on 29 November 2021, supplemented with gray literature searches. Studies reporting any health-related quality of life (HRQoL) or health state utility outcomes in IgAN patients were included in the humanistic impact SLR, and studies reporting the costs and healthcare resource utilization associated with or economic models of IgAN disease management were included in the economic burden SLR. Narrative synthesis was used to discuss the heterogeneous studies included in the SLRs. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines were followed, and all included studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Center for Evidence-Based Management tool for Critical Appraisal of a Survey or the Drummond Checklist. RESULTS: A total of 876 and 1122 references were identified from electronic and gray literature searches for humanistic and economic burden, respectively. Three studies reporting humanistic impact and five studies reporting economic burden met criteria for inclusion in these SLRs. The included humanistic studies reported patient preferences in the USA and China, HRQoL for patients with IgAN in Poland, and impact of exercise on HRQoL for patients with IgAN in China. The five economic studies reported costs of IgAN treatment in Canada, Italy, and China, along with two economic models from Japan. DISCUSSION: Current literature suggests IgAN is associated with substantial humanistic and economic burdens. However, these SLRs demonstrate the paucity of research conducted to specifically describe the humanistic or economic burden of IgAN and highlight the need for further research.",0
Practices and Views of US Oncologists and Genetic Counselors Regarding Patient Recontact After Variant Reclassification: Results of a Nationwide Survey.,"PURPOSE: Over a 5-year or 10-year period, between 6% and 15% of germline cancer genetic variants undergo reclassification. Up-to-date interpretation can clarify a variant's clinical significance and guide patient management. As the frequency of reclassifications increase, the issue of whether, how, when, and which providers should recontact patients with information about reclassification becomes important. However, the field lacks research evidence and definitive guidance from professional organizations about how providers should recontact patients. We compared the perspectives of US oncologists and cancer genetic counselors (GCs) to describe their practices and views regarding recontact. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a survey using themes identified from semistructured interviews with oncologists and GCs and administered it in a national sample of oncologists and GCs between July and September 2022. RESULTS: In total, 634 respondents completed the survey including 349 oncologists and 285 GCs. On frequency of recontacting patients with reclassified results, 40% of GCs reported recontacting often compared with 12.5% of oncologists. Neither group reported recording patient preference for recontact on electronic medical record (EMR). Both groups agreed that all reclassified variants, even those that do not affect clinical management, should be returned to patients. They also reported that recontact via EMR messages, mailed letters, and phone calls from GC assistants were more suitable for downgrades. By contrast, face-to-face meetings and phone calls were preferred for upgrades. Remarkably, oncologists were more likely to endorse face-to-face return of results and were more likely to endorse return through a nongenetics provider compared to GCs. CONCLUSION: These data on current recontact practices and opinions provide a foundation for developing guidelines with explicit recommendations on patient recontact that can help maximize clinical effect while considering provider preferences for recontact within resource-constrained genomic practice settings.",0
Conflicting attitudes between clinicians and women regarding maternal requested caesarean section: a qualitative evidence synthesis.,"BACKGROUND: Caesarean section (CS) can be a life-saving operation but might also negatively affect the health of both the woman and the baby. The aim of this study was to synthesize and contrast women's and clinicians' attitudes toward maternal-requested CS, and their experiences of the decision-making process around CS. METHODS: The databases of CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycInfo and Scopus were screened. All qualitative studies that answered the study question and that were assessed to have minor or moderate methodological limitations were included. Synthesised findings were assessed using GRADE-CERQual. RESULTS: The Qualitative Evidence Synthesis included 14 qualitative studies (published 2000-2022), involving 242 women and 141 clinicians. From the women's perspectives, two themes arose: women regarded CS as the safest mode of birth; and women's rights to receive support and acceptance for a CS request. From the clinicians' perspectives, four themes emerged: clinicians were concerned about health risks associated with CS; demanding experience to consult women with a CS request; conflicting attitudes about women's rights to choose a CS; and the importance of respectful and constructive dialogue about birthing options. CONCLUSION: Women and clinicians often had different perceptions regarding the right of a woman to choose CS, the risks associated with CS, and the kind of support that should be part of the decision-making process. While women expected to receive acceptance for their CS request, clinicians perceived that their role was to support the woman in the decision-making process through consultation and discussion. While clinicians thought it was important to show respect for a woman's birth preferences, they also felt the need to resist a woman's request for CS and encourage her to give birth vaginally due to the associated increases in health risks.",0
The best defence is a good offence: Ensuring equitable access to primary care in Canada.,"Ensuring access to primary care is a persistent challenge in Canada, and the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing gaps. Public policy reform that only partially addresses these access issues, technological opportunities, workforce desires, or patient preferences creates an opportunity for private, investor-owned corporations to take ownership of primary care delivery systems. This article summarizes the history of the ""public-private"" conversation as it pertains to primary care, with a particular focus on investor-owned corporations. We outline how profit-driven, corporate healthcare impacts equitable access to care, increases spending on low-value services, and undermines the underlying values of Canadian healthcare systems. All of healthcare delivery requires rapid regulation and oversight by policy-makers, which would increase transparency of corporate care. There also must be parallel efforts placed on addressing the long-standing issues in publicly funded delivery of primary care that created the space for corporate care to grow.",0
[Technical points of human use experience of ethnic medicine].,"Ethnic medicine has a rich history of application. Because of the large number of ethnic groups, wide geographical distribution, and unique medical systems in China, the research on the human use experience(HUE) of ethnic medicine should combine the characteristics of ethnic medicine, be based on practical experience, and respect folk practice and tradition. The clinical positioning of ethnic medicine should consider three factors, i.e., population region, dominant diseases, and clinical demand. We should consider the development of traditional preparations that meet the needs of ethnic regions and encourage the development of new drugs that can be popularized and used nationwide for the dominant diseases of ethnic medicines. Attention should be paid to the problems such as a large number of customary articles or substitutes of ethnic medicinal materials, the phenomena of foreign bodies with the same name and different names for the same substance, the different standards of medicinal materials, and the poor processing standards. The name, processing method, source, medicinal parts, and dosage of ethnic medicinal materials or decoction pieces should be determined, and resources should be carefully evaluated to ensure the safety of medicinal resources and ecology. The preparation of ethnic medicine is mostly in the form of pills, powder, ointment, etc., with simple processing technology. The problems of low-quality stan-dards of some preparations, different prescriptions with the same name, and inconsistent processing technology should be overcome, and the process route and main process parameters should be clarified to lay the foundation for the subsequent empirical research on HUE. In the collection and analysis of the HUE data of ethnic medicine, the core guiding ideology of &quot;patient-centered&quot; should be established, and the experience data of patients should be collected. The problems of weak links existing in the inheritance of ethnic medicine should be solved, and flexible and diverse methods should be adopted. Meanwhile, on the premise of complying with the requirements of the principles of medical ethics, we should respect the religion, culture, and customs of ethnic areas to obtain the key HUE information of ethnic medicine. On the basis of the patient preference information and differences in regional disease epidemiology, population characteristics, and medical practice, whether the HUE conclusions of ethnic medicine can be extrapolated to patients outside the region is evaluated from the aspects of clinical benefits, risk tolerance, risk acceptance, etc. The HUE research on ethnic medicine is carried out in a clear way to guide the research and development of new ethnic medicines.",0
International Delphi Study on Wound Closure and Incision Management in Joint Arthroplasty Part 2: Total Hip Arthroplasty.,"BACKGROUND: This modified Delphi study aimed to develop a consensus on optimal wound closure and incision management strategies for total hip arthroplasty (THA). Given the critical nature of wound care and incision management in influencing patient outcomes, this study sought to synthesize evidence-based best practices for wound care in THA procedures. METHODS: An international panel of 20 orthopedic surgeons from Europe, Canada, and the United States evaluated a targeted literature review of 18 statements (14 specific to THA and 4 related to both THA and total knee arthroplasty). There were 3 rounds of anonymous voting per topic using a modified 5-point Likert scale with a predetermined consensus threshold of ≥ 75% agreement necessary for a statement to be accepted. RESULTS: After 3 rounds of voting, consensus was achieved for all 18 statements. Notable recommendations for THA wound management included (1) the use of barbed sutures over non-barbed sutures (shorter closing times and overall cost savings); (2) the use of subcuticular sutures over skin staples (lower risk of superficial infections and higher patient preferences, but longer closing times); (3) the use of mesh-adhesives over silver-impregnated dressings (lower rate of wound complications); (4) for at-risk patients, the use of negative pressure wound therapy over other dressings (lower wound complications and reoperations, as well as fewer dressing changes); and (5) the use of triclosan-coated sutures (lower risk of surgical site infection) over standard sutures. CONCLUSIONS: Through a structured modified Delphi approach, a panel of 20 orthopedic surgeons reached consensus on all 18 statements pertaining to wound closure and incision management in THA. This study provides a foundational framework for establishing evidence-based best practices, aiming to reduce variability in patient outcomes and to enhance the overall quality of care in THA procedures.",0
Contemporary outcomes for arterial reconstruction with non-saphenous vein cryo-preserved conduits.,"OBJECTIVE: Cryopreserved (CP) products are utilized during challenging cases when autogenous or prosthetic conduit use is not feasible. Despite decades of experience with cadaveric greater saphenous vein (GSV), there is limited available data regarding the outcomes and patency of other CP products, specifically arterial and deep venous grafts. This study was designed to evaluate outcomes of non-GSV CP conduits in patients undergoing urgent, emergent, and elective arterial reconstruction at our institution. We hypothesized that non-GSV CP allografts have adequate patency and outcomes and are therefore a feasible alternative to GSV in settings where autologous graft is unavailable or prosthetic grafts are contraindicated. METHODS: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at our institution. We retrospectively reviewed charts of patients undergoing arterial reconstructions using CP conduits from 2010 to 2022. Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, smoking status, indications for surgery, indication for CP conduit use, anatomic reconstruction, urgency of procedure, and blood loss. Time-to-event outcomes included primary and secondary graft patency rates, follow-up amputations, and mortality; other complications included follow-up infection/reinfection and 30-day complications, including return to the operating room and perioperative mortality. Time-to-event analyses were evaluated using product-limit survival estimates. RESULTS: Of 96 identified patients receiving CP conduits, 56 patients received non-GSV conduits for 66 arterial reconstructions. The most common type of non-GSV CP product used was femoral artery (31 patients), followed by aorto-iliac artery (22 patients), and femoral vein (19 patients), with some patients receiving more than one reconstruction or CP product. Patients were mostly male (75%), with a mean age of 63.1 years and a mean body mass index of 26.7 kg/m(2). Indications for CP conduit use included infection in 53 patients, hostile environment in 36 patients, contaminated field in 30 patients, tissue coverage concerns in 30 patients, inadequate conduit in nine patients, and patient preference in one patient. Notably, multiple patients had more than one indication. Most surgeries (95%) were performed in urgent or emergent settings. Supra-inguinal reconstructions were most common (53%), followed by extra-anatomic bypasses (47%). Thirty-day mortality occurred in 10 patients (19%). Fifteen patients (27%) required return to the operating room for indications related to the vascular reconstructions, with 10 (18%) cases being unplanned and five (9%) cases planned/staged. Overall survival at 6, 12, and 24 months was 80%, 68%, and 59%, respectively. Primary patency at 6, 12, and 24 months was 86%, 70%, and 62%, respectively. Amputation freedom at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months was 98%, 95%, and 86%, respectively for non-traumatic indications. CONCLUSIONS: Non-GSV CP products may be used in complex arterial reconstructions when autogenous or prosthetic options are not feasible or available.",0
Determining Goal Concordant Care in the Intensive Care Unit Using Electronic Health Records.,"BACKGROUND: Goal concordant care (GCC) is the alignment of care to patient values and preferences. GCC is a major outcome of communication with patients and families in serious/critical illness. Using the electronic health record (EHR) to study the provision of GCC would be pragmatic and cost-effective for research and quality improvement efforts. RESEARCH QUESTION: Do EHRs contain information to identify GCC? METHODS: This is a feasibility retrospective chart review performed by two independent reviewers. An existing framework containing four questions for identifying GCC was adopted. Two clinicians reviewed multi-disciplinary notes and extracted pertinent information. The primary outcomes were whether the four key questions for determining goal concordance could be answered using information in the EHR. The secondary outcome was the type of goals identified. Cohen's kappa was used to measure agreement between two reviewers. RESULTS: Patient care was considered goal concordant in 35 (85%) of 41 patients in a random sample comprising of 36 survivors and five who died in hospital. Inter-rater agreement on identifying data to determine GCC was excellent (Kappa 0.70). Patient goals were identified in 80% of charts reviewed. Note sources informative of patient preferences, included social work (39%), hospital progress notes (29%), palliative care (20%), and physical/occupational therapy (15%). ""Returning home"" and ""getting better/ stronger"" were among the most common patient goals captured in EHR. CONCLUSION: The EHR can be used to understand patient goals, but the information is scattered across the multi-disciplinary notes. Improving EHR and external validation will facilitate ascertainment of goal concordance as an important outcome measure.",0
It Shouldn't Be a Battle: Customizing Shared Decision Making to Meet Patients' Preferences.,.,0
Beyond 10-year lead-times in EQ-5D-5L: leveraging alternative lead-times in willingness-to-accept questions to capture preferences for worse-than-dead states and their implication.,"BACKGROUND: A fixed 10-year lead-time in composite time-trade-off (C-TTO) tasks might compromise the precision of utility values below - 1. This study explored how alternative lead-times (ALTs) influence EQ-5D-5L value sets and their implications in economic evaluations. METHODS: Leveraging data from Taiwan's EQ-5D-5L valuation and capitalizing on its exploratory willingness-to-accept question, we explored participants' quantification of ""worse-than-dead (WTD)"" health states with ALTs up to 50 years. We then derived alternative value sets incorporating these ALTs through interval regression and compared them against those from conventional models. To evaluate their impact on health change valuation, we simulated utility differences for all possible EQ-5D-5L health-state-pairs using each value set. RESULTS: With a salient floor effect observed in the C-TTO values, the model with ALT led to a wider range of predicted utilities ( - 2.3897 ~ 1), compared with those of conventional models (generalized least squares (GLS):  - 0.7773 ~ 1; Tobit-GLS:  - 0.9583 ~ 1). Compared to the Tobit-GLS model, the model with ALT increased the numerical distance in 80% of health-state-pairs, with 11% decreasing and 9% altering direction (e.g., positive to negative) in utility differences. CONCLUSIONS: While ALTs offer insights into patient preferences, their integration into economic evaluations might require rescaling. Future research should prioritize advanced rescaling methods or enhanced elicitation strategies for populations with substantial censoring. This is pivotal for improving the elicitation of extreme WTD states and accurately discerning the relative distances between health states. Countries developing EQ-5D-5L value sets should consider pilot studies and incorporating region-specific questions on social determinants, especially where pronounced floor effects are suspected.",0
"A review of evidence, antimicrobial stability, and feasibility considerations for OPAT continuous infusion.","Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) has been widely used in clinical practice for many decades because of its associated cost savings, reductions in inpatient hospital days, and decreases in hospital-associated infections. Despite this long history, evolving practice patterns and new drug delivery devices continue to present challenges as well as opportunities for clinicians when designing appropriate outpatient antimicrobial regimens. One such change is the increasing use of extended and continuous infusion (CI) of antimicrobials to optimize the achievement of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic targets. Elastomeric devices are also becoming increasingly popular in OPAT, including for the delivery of CI. In this article, we review the clinical evidence for CI in OPAT, as well as practical considerations of patient preferences, cost, and antimicrobial stability.",0
[Cosmetic outcome of nasal tip reconstruction with the frontonasal flap and other locoregional flaps - Cosmetic Outcome of Nasal Tip Reconstruction].,"BACKGROUND: This study investigates the results of nasal tip reconstruction with the frontonasal flap compared with other locoregional flaps. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All nasal tip reconstructions with locoregional flaps performed during a 10-year period were included. Defect size, flap type, risk factors, comorbidities, complications, revisions, and secondary operations were retrospectively assessed. Clinical follow-up examinations were performed after 12 months. Digital photographs were taken in standard projections preoperatively and at the time of the last follow-up examination, and the aesthetic results were assessed by three independent examiners, with nasal contour, symmetry, scarring, and match of skin colour between flap and nasal skin rated on a 4-point scale. Finally, patient satisfaction was obtained. RESULTS: A total of 112 nasal tip reconstructions were performed in 68 women and 44 men with a mean age of 71,4±10,2 years. Taking into account defect size, individual factors and patient preference, reconstruction was performed with 58 frontonasal flaps, 23 Rintala flaps, 20 paramedian forehead flaps and 11 bilobed flaps. Mean age and comorbidities of patients were comparable between flap types, except for a higher incidence of arterial hypertension and a lower incidence of diabetes mellitus in patients treated with frontonasal flaps. Defect size was the same in reconstructions with frontonasal flaps and Rintala flaps, smaller in bilobed flaps, and more extensive in paramedian forehead flaps. There were no differences in complication rates between the different flap techniques. Taking into account the planned second interventions (flap pedicle separations) in the paramedian forehead flaps, the frequency of unplanned corrections was comparable for all flap techniques. Aesthetic results and patient satisfaction were rated as very good or good in more than 90% with all techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the paramedian forehead flap, the frontonasal flap avoids a planned secondary procedure and an extensive donor defect. It allows for the coverage of defects at least the size of the Rintala flap and larger defects than the bilobed flap.",0
Management of Lobular Neoplasia Diagnosed by Core Biopsy.,"Lobular neoplasia (LN) involves proliferative changes within the breast lobules. LN is divided into lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH). LCIS can be further subdivided into three subtypes: classic LCIS, pleomorphic LCIS, and LCIS with necrosis (florid type). Because classic LCIS is now considered as a benign etiology, current guidelines recommend close follow-up with imaging versus surgical excision. The goal of our study was to determine if the diagnosis of classic LN on core needle biopsy (CNB) merits surgical excision. This is a retrospective, observational study conducted at Mount Auburn Hospital, Cambridge, MA, from May 17, 2017, through June 30, 2020. We reviewed the data of breast biopsies conducted at our hospital over this period and included patients who were diagnosed with classic LN (LCIS and/or ALH) and excluded patients having any other atypical lesions on CNB. All known cancer patients were excluded. Of the 2707 CNBs performed during the study period, we identified 68 women who were diagnosed with ALH or LCIS on CNB. CNB was performed for an abnormal mammogram in the majority of patients (60; 88%) while 7(10.3%) had an abnormal breast magnetic resonance imaging study (MRI), and 1 had an abnormal ultrasound (US). A total of 58 patients (85%) underwent excisional biopsy, of which 3 (5.2%) showed malignancy, including 2 cases of DCIS and 1 invasive carcinoma. In addition, there was 1 case (1.7%) with pleomorphic LCIS and 11 cases with ADH (15.5%). The management of LN found on core biopsy is evolving, with some advocating surgical excision and others recommending observation. Our data show a change in diagnosis with excisional biopsy in 13 (22.4%) of patients with 2 cases of DCIS, 1 invasive carcinoma, 1 pleomorphic LCIS, and 9 cases of ADH, diagnosed on excisional biopsy. While ALH and classic LCIS are considered benign, the choice of ongoing surveillance versus excisional biopsy should be made with shared decision making with the patient, with consideration of personal and family history, as well as patient preferences.",0
Patient-Preference Diagnostics: Adapting Stated-Preference Methods to Inform Effective Shared Decision Making.,"BACKGROUND: While clinical practice guidelines underscore the need to incorporate patient preferences in clinical decision making, incorporating meaningful assessment of patient preferences in clinical encounters is challenging. Structured approaches that combine quantitative patient preferences and clinical evidence could facilitate effective patient-provider communication and more patient-centric health care decisions. Adaptive conjoint or stated-preference approaches can identify individual preference parameters, but they can require a relatively large number of choice questions or simplifying assumptions about the error with which preferences are elicited. METHOD: We propose an approach to efficiently diagnose preferences of patients for outcomes of treatment alternatives by leveraging prior information on patient preferences to generate adaptive choice questions to identify a patient's proximity to known preference phenotypes. This information can be used for measuring sensitivity and specificity, much like any other diagnostic procedure. We simulated responses with varying levels of choice errors for hypothetical patients with specific preference profiles to measure sensitivity and specificity of a 2-question preference diagnostic. RESULTS: We identified 4 classes representing distinct preference profiles for patients who participated in a previous first-time anterior shoulder dislocation (FTASD) survey. Posterior probabilities of class membership at the end of a 2-question sequence ranged from 87% to 89%. We found that specificity and sensitivity of the 2-question sequences were robust to respondent errors. The questions appeared to have better specificity than sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that this approach could help diagnose patient preferences for treatments for a condition such as FTASD with acceptable precision using as few as 2 choice questions. Such preference-diagnostic tools could be used to improve and document alignment of treatment choices and patient preferences. HIGHLIGHTS: Approaches that combine patient preferences and clinical evidence can facilitate effective patient-provider communication and more patient-centric healthcare decisions. However, diagnosing individual-level preferences is challenging, and no formal diagnostic tools exist.We propose a structured approach to efficiently diagnose patient preferences based on prior information on the distribution of patient preferences in a population.We generated a 2-question test of preferences for the outcomes associated with the treatment of first-time anterior shoulder dislocation.The diagnosis of preferences can help physicians discuss relevant aspects of the treatment options and proactively address patient concerns during the clinical encounter.",1
Physician factors affecting patient preferences in selecting a primary care provider: A qualitative research study in Singapore.,"BACKGROUND: Care continuity by a dedicated, well-trained primary care physician (PCP) has shown to improve health outcomes of patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs). In Singapore's fee-for-service primary care system, patients can choose to consult any PCP in either a public (polyclinic), private (General Practitioners/ GP), or both types of clinics, resulting in potential fragmented care. Decision-making by patients in selecting their preferred PCP remains unclear. This study aims to explore the personal factors influencing the choice of PCP among patients with NCDs in primary care. METHODS: This qualitative research study was conducted in a typical polyclinic. In-depth interviews were conducted on patients with NCDs. Purposive sampling was implemented to enrol patients who had previously consulted PCPs in polyclinics and GP clinics, garnering their perspectives and experiences of care received from both providers. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and audited. Data was coded and analysed using thematic content analysis to identify emerging themes. The physician-specific factors which influence patients' decision-making of PCP selection are presented here. RESULTS: Twenty-one Asian patients aged 38 to 82 years were interviewed. They preferred PCPs with an approachable and genuine demeanour, exhibiting empathy and compassion. They valued the PCPs' verbal, non-verbal and listening skills. Regarding professional qualities, patients wanted PCPs to demonstrate competency and a patient-centred care approach. Some selected their PCP based on compatible age and gender that they felt comfortable with. Establishing good rapport with their PCP and maintaining continuity of care were deemed as major factors in patients' PCP selection. CONCLUSION: Patients tended to select PCPs based on their personal characteristics, interpersonal skills, professional attributes, demographics, and the physician-patient relationship. PCPs should be aware of these attributes and demonstrate them during their patient interaction. Leveraging on this enables PCPs to build rapport with their patients and maintain care continuity to optimize their health outcomes.",0
Racial and ethnic inequities in the quality of paediatric care in the USA: a review of quantitative evidence.,"Racial and ethnic inequities in paediatric care have received increased research attention over the past two decades, particularly in the past 5 years, alongside an increased societal focus on racism. In this Series paper, the first in a two-part Series focused on racism and child health in the USA, we summarise evidence on racial and ethnic inequities in the quality of paediatric care. We review studies published between Jan 1, 2017 and July 31, 2022, that are adjusted for or stratified by insurance status to account for group differences in access, and we exclude studies in which differences in access are probably driven by patient preferences or the appropriateness of intervention. Overall, the literature reveals widespread patterns of inequitable treatment across paediatric specialties, including neonatology, primary care, emergency medicine, inpatient and critical care, surgery, developmental disabilities, mental health care, endocrinology, and palliative care. The identified studies indicate that children from minoritised racial and ethnic groups received poorer health-care services relative to non-Hispanic White children, with most studies drawing on data from multiple sites, and accounting for indicators of family socioeconomic position and clinical characteristics (eg, comorbidities or condition severity). The studies discussed a range of potential causes for the observed disparities, including implicit biases and differences in site of care or clinician characteristics. We outline priorities for future research to better understand and address paediatric treatment inequities and implications for practice and policy. Policy changes within and beyond the health-care system, discussed further in the second paper of this Series, are essential to address the root causes of treatment inequities and to promote equitable and excellent health for all children.",0
Comparison of patient preferences and responsiveness among common patient-reported outcome measures for hand/wrist injuries or disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were developed to examine patients' perceptions of functional health. Most studies compare the responsiveness of each type of questionnaire. However, reports of patient preferences among PROMs commonly used with patients with hand/wrist injuries or disorders are limited. This study aimed to compare patient preferences, factors associated with those preferences and responsiveness among the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ), Patient-Rated Wrist/Hand Evaluation (PRWHE) and EQ-5D in patients with hand/wrist injuries or disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study collected data on 183 patients with hand/wrist injuries or diseases who had visited a hand/wrist outpatient clinic or were hospitalized for surgery between 2017 and 2020. Patients had to be at least 18 years old and able to complete the four questionnaires included in the study. The four PROMs (DASH, MHQ, PRWHE and EQ-5D) were administered to the patients prior to treatment. After completing the questionnaires, patients were asked to answer two open-ended questions regarding their preferences. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify factors related to patient preferences. Results are presented as the relative risk ratio (RRR). The standardized response mean (SRM) was used to evaluate questionnaire responsiveness. RESULTS: Of the 183 patients, most preferred the PRWHE questionnaire (n = 74, 41%), with the main reasons cited being ""specific to injuries/diseases and reflects hand/wrist function (n = 23, 31%)"" and ""easy to complete (n = 22, 30%)."" Sex was found to be associated with patient preference after adjusting for demographic data and reasons for choosing a PROM as confounders (RRR = 0.46, P value = 0.049). The PRWHE had the highest SRM, followed by DASH (0.92 and 0.88, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The PRWHE is the most preferred by patients and is the most responsive questionnaire. It is recommended for use in clinical practice in situations where a clinician would like to use only one PROM for evaluating patients with various types of hand/wrist problems. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic III.",0
Regional control after precision lymph node dissection for clinically evident melanoma metastasis.,"INTRODUCTION: Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for microscopic lymph node metastases has been replaced by observation; however, CLND is standard for clinically detectable nodal metastases (cLN). CLND has high morbidity, which may be reduced by excision of only the cLN (precision lymph node dissection [PLND]). We hypothesized that same-basin recurrence risk would be low after PLND. METHODS: Retrospective review at four tertiary care hospitals identified patients who underwent PLND. The primary outcome was 3-year cumulative incidence of isolated same-basin recurrence. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients underwent PLND for cLN without synchronous distant metastases. Reasons for forgoing CLND included patient preference (n = 11), comorbidities (n = 5), imaging indeterminate for distant metastases (n = 2), partial response to checkpoint blockade (n = 1), or not reported (n = 2). A median of 2 nodes (range: 1-6) were resected at PLND, and 68% contained melanoma. Recurrence was observed in 33% overall. Only 1 patient (5%) developed an isolated same-basin recurrence. Cumulative incidences at 3 years were 5.0%, 17.3%, and 49.7% for isolated same-basin recurrence, any same-basin recurrence, and any recurrence, respectively. Complications from PLND were reported in 1 patient (5%). CONCLUSIONS: These pilot data suggest that PLND may provide adequate regional disease control with less morbidity than CLND. These data justify prospective evaluation of PLND in select patients.",0
Patients' Preferences for Connected Insulin Pens: A Discrete Choice Experiment Among Patients with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.,"BACKGROUND: This study quantified how people with diabetes value the unique features of connected insulin pens and related mobile apps, and the underlying reasons for preferring connected versus non-connected insulin pens. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in the USA and UK to elicit preferences of adults (≥ 18 years) with type 1 or 2 diabetes for attributes of insulin pens. Attributes included device type, dosing support, glucose monitoring, additional app features, and data sharing. Relative attribute importance (RAI) scores were calculated to capture the relative importance of an attribute. Predicted choice probabilities were obtained to compare different profiles for connected and non-connected insulin pens. RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 540 participants (58.9% male; 90.7% Caucasian; mean age, 58.3 years; 69.4% type 2 diabetes). Participants most valued the possibility of using a connected insulin pen with dosing support and automated dose logging (RAI = 39.9%), followed by automatic transfer of glucose levels (RAI = 29.0%), additional features of tracking diet and physical activity (RAI = 14.6%), data sharing (RAI = 13.6%), and device type (RAI = 2.9%). All profiles of connected insulin pens were preferred over a non-connected pen (p < 0.001), and pen profiles with advanced features were preferred over those without (p < 0.001). Preferences differed by age but not diabetes type, country of residence, or insulin regimen. CONCLUSION: People with diabetes in the USA and UK prefer connected over non-connected insulin pens due largely to the availability of automated logging of dose and glucose levels.",1
How Schroth Therapists Vary the Implementation of Schroth Worldwide for Adolescents with Idiopathic Scoliosis: A Mixed Methods Study.,"(1) Background: Schroth is a type of physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercise (PSSE) prescribed to adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Studies have investigated the effectiveness of Schroth but are yet to elucidate how Schroth is applied clinically and the factors that influence their prescription. (2) Methods: A mixed methods design was used comprising an anonymous survey and semi-structured interviews of Schroth therapists who treated AIS and who were publicly listed on the Barcelona Scoliosis Physical Therapy School or the International Schroth 3-dimensional Scoliosis Therapy School websites. The survey included 64 questions covering demographics, session and treatment characteristics, and whether therapists included other treatment modalities in their clinical practice. A convenience sample of survey participants were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview to further explore the factors that influenced their prescription of Schroth for AIS. Results from the survey were analyzed descriptively (n, %), whereas inductive thematic analysis was used for the interviews. (3) Results: of the 173 survey respondents (18% response rate), most were from Europe and North America (64.0%), female (78.6%), physiotherapists (96.0%), and worked in private settings (72.3%). Fifty-two per cent of participants used other types of PSSE as an adjunct to Schroth, the Scientific Exercise Approach to Scoliosis (SEAS) being the most frequently used (37.9%). Non-PSSE methods were used 'at some point' as an adjunct by 98.8% of participants, including massage and other soft tissue techniques (80.9%), Pilates (46.6%), and Yoga (31.5%). The Schroth techniques used by all survey respondents included breathing and pelvic corrections. Seven participants were interviewed, but data saturation was achieved after only four interviews. Thematic analysis revealed four, inter-related broad themes describing the factors that influenced Schroth prescription for AIS: (1) the adolescent as a whole, including physical, emotional and mental characteristics, and patient goals, (2) family, including parent relationship with the adolescent and the motivation of parents in regard to Schroth, (3) the systems within which the treatment was being offered, such as vicinity to the clinic and the presence of financial insurance support, and (4) therapist characteristics, such as their training and experience. (4) Conclusions: Schroth therapists worldwide use a variety of adjunctive methods to treat AIS. Therapists prescribing Schroth exercises to AIS consider the complex interplay of intra-, inter- and extra-personal factors in clinical practice. These considerations move beyond the three components of evidence-based practice of research, patient preferences, and clinical expertise, towards a systems-based reflection on exercise prescription.",0
Comparing preference for and use of medication abortion in Texas after policy changes in 2014 and 2018.,"OBJECTIVES: Assess preferences for and use of medication abortion in Texas after implementation of two policy changes: a 2013 state law restricting medication abortion and the FDA label change for mifepristone in 2016 nullifying some of this restriction. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed surveys conducted in 2014 and 2018 with abortion patients at 10 Texas abortion facilities. We calculated the percentage of all respondents with an initial preference for medication abortion by survey year, and the type of abortion obtained or planned to obtain among those who were at <10 weeks of gestation. We used multivariable-adjusted mixed-effects Poisson regression models to assess factors associated with medication abortion preference and actual/planned use. RESULTS: Overall, 156 (41%) of 376 respondents in 2014 and 247 (55%) of 448 respondents in 2018 reported initial preference for medication abortion (Prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.28; 95% CI 1.03-1.59). Among those who were <10 weeks of gestation and initially preferred medication abortion, 39 of 124 (31%) obtained or were planning to obtain the method in 2014, compared with 188 of 223 (84%) in 2018 (PR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.69-4.15). After multivariable adjustment, respondents who initially preferred medication abortion and were 7 to 9 weeks of gestation at the time of their ultrasonography (vs <7 weeks) were less likely to obtain or plan to obtain the method (PR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57-0.84). CONCLUSIONS: Abortion patients were more likely to prefer and obtain or plan to obtain their preferred medication abortion after legal restrictions in Texas were nullified. IMPLICATIONS: State policies can affect people's ability to obtain their preferred abortion method. Efforts to provide both abortion options whenever possible, and inform people where each can be obtained, remains an important component of person-centered care despite increasing state abortion restrictions and bans following the reversal of Roe v Wade.",0
Minimizing Costs for Dorsal Wrist Ganglion Treatment: A Cost-Minimization Analysis.,"PURPOSE: Dorsal wrist ganglions are treated commonly with aspiration, or open or arthroscopic excision in operating room (OR) or procedure room (PR) settings. As it remains unclear which treatment strategy is most cost-effective in yielding cyst resolution, our purpose was to perform a formal cost-minimization analysis from the societal perspective in this context. METHODS: A microsimulation decision analytic model evaluating 5 treatment strategies for dorsal wrist ganglions was developed, ending in either resolution or a single failed open revision surgical excision. Strategies included immediate open excision in the OR, immediate open excision in the PR, immediate arthroscopic excision in the OR, or 1 or 2 aspirations before each of the surgical options. Recurrence and complications rates were pooled from the literature for each treatment type. One-way sensitivity and threshold analyses were performed. RESULTS: The most cost-minimal strategy was 2 aspiration attempts before open surgical excision in the PR setting ($1,603 ± 1,595 per resolved case), followed by 2 aspirations before open excision in the OR ($1,969 ± 2,165 per resolved case). Immediate arthroscopic excision was the costliest strategy ($6,539 ± 264 per resolved case). Single aspiration preoperatively was more cost-minimal than any form of immediate surgery ($2,918 ± 306 and $4,188 ± 306 per resolved case performed in the PR and OR, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: From the societal perspective, performing 2 aspirations before surgical excision in the PR setting was the most cost-minimal treatment strategy, although in reference to surgeons who do not perform this procedure in the PR setting, open excision in the OR was nearly as cost-effective. As patient preferences may preclude routinely performing 2 aspirations, performing at least 1 aspiration before surgical excision improves the cost-effectiveness of dorsal wrist ganglions treatment.

"Patient preferences in geriatric wards, a survey of health care professionals' practice, experience and attitudes.","PURPOSE: We aimed to identify whether health care professionals (HCP) examine their patient and next-of-kin preferences, and to study whether medical decisions follow these preferences. METHOD: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted with multidisciplinary HCP from 12 geriatric wards in the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority. RESULTS: Of the 289 HCPs responding (response rate 61%), mean age 37.8 years (SD 11.3), 235 (81.3%) women, 12.4 (SD 9.6) years of experience and 67 (23.2%) medical doctors, only half report clarifying patients' preferences. The majority reported that they did not inform, involve and treat in line with such preferences. However, 53% believe that HCP, patients and next-of-kin should make clinical decisions together. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate a lack of engagement in conversation and inclusion of patient preferences when providing health interventions in geriatric wards. Measures for change of culture are needed.",0
Australian Patient Preferences for the Introduction of Spirituality into their Healthcare Journey: A Mixed Methods Study.,"While patients value engagement concerning their spirituality as a part of holistic healthcare, there is little evidence regarding the preferred way to engage in discussions about spirituality. This study investigated inpatient preferences regarding how they would like spirituality to be raised in the hospital setting. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with inpatients at six hospitals in Sydney, Australia (n = 897), with a subset invited to participate in qualitative interviews (n = 41). There was high approval for all proposed spiritual history prompts (94.0-99.8%). In interviews, the context dictated the appropriateness of discussions. Findings indicated a high level of patient acceptability for discussing spirituality in healthcare. Further research and more detailed analysis is required and proposed to be undertaken.",0
Public Preferences for Introducing a COVID-19 Certificate: A Discrete Choice Experiment in the Netherlands.,"OBJECTIVE: Here we investigate public preferences for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) certificates in the Netherlands, and whether these preferences differ between subgroups in the population. METHODS: A survey including a discrete choice experiment was administered to 1500 members of the adult population of the Netherlands. Each participant was asked to choose between hypothetical COVID-19 certificates that differed in seven attributes: the starting date, and whether the certificate allowed gathering with multiple people, shopping without appointment, visiting bars and restaurants, visiting cinemas and theatres, attending events, and practising indoor sports. Latent class models (LCMs) were used to determine the attribute relative importance and predicted acceptance rate of hypothetical certificates. RESULTS: Three classes of preference patterns were identified in the LCM. One class a priori opposed a certificate (only two attributes influencing preferences), another class was relatively neutral and included all attributes in their decision making, and the final class was positive towards a certificate. Respondents aged > 65 years and those who plan to get vaccinated were more likely to belong to the latter two classes. Being allowed to shop without appointment and to visit bars and restaurants was most important to all respondents, increasing predicted acceptance rate by 12 percentage points. CONCLUSIONS: Preferences for introduction of a COVID-19 certificate are mixed. A certificate that allows for shopping without appointment and visiting bars and restaurants is likely to increase acceptance. The support of younger citizens and those who plan to get vaccinated seems most sensitive to the specific freedoms granted by a COVID-19 certificate.",1
Assessment of women's treatment preferences for vasomotor symptoms due to menopause.,"BACKGROUND: Several therapies for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) due to menopause are available. Treatment preferences and willingness-to-pay for VMS treatment among US women with VMS were evaluated. METHODS: An online survey of women with perimenopausal or postmenopausal VMS was conducted (3/15/21-4/23/21). A discrete choice experiment quantified the impact of 7 treatment attributes on VMS treatment choice: VMS frequency/severity reduction, sleep improvement, risk of breast cancer/cardiovascular events in 6 years, risk of short-term side effects, and out-of-pocket costs. Preference weights (PWs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated and reported. RESULTS: Among 467 women, 86.5% and 87.8% reported moderate to very severe VMS and sleep problems during the preceding month, respectively. Sleep improvement (PW: 0.843; 95% CI: 0.721, 0.965) and reduction in VMS frequency (PW: 0.658; 95% CI: 0.520, 0.796) and severity (PW: 0.628; 95% CI: 0.500, 0.756) most influenced treatment preference; risk of cardiovascular events (PW: 0.150; 95% CI: 0.069, 0.232) or breast cancer (PW: 0.401; 95% CI: 0.306, 0.496) in 6 years had lesser effect. Willingness-to-pay was an additional $35-$46/month for substantially improved sleep, 80% VMS frequency reduction, and reduction from severe to mild VMS. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep improvement and reductions in VMS frequency/severity were the most important treatment attributes.",1
Enhancing Patient Choice: Using Self-administered Intranasal Naloxone for Novel Rapid Buprenorphine Initiation.,"Buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) is a lifesaving treatment for opioid use disorder. The increasing use of illicitly manufactured fentanyl, however, has made initiating BUP-NX more likely to precipitate withdrawal-an experience that deters treatment and causes return to use. If BUP-NX cannot be successfully started, it cannot work. We describe the case of a patient who was able to transition to a therapeutic dose of BUP-NX less than 3 hours after his last illicitly manufactured fentanyl use by choosing to self-administer intranasal naloxone. After the naloxone, the transition took 31 minutes, including 14 minutes of expected moderately severe withdrawal. He remains in care with BUP-NX and would recommend this transition approach to others.",0
