Patient preferences in chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases potentially treated with biological drugs: discrete choice analysis using real-world data analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) represent a high burden due to their chronicity, high prevalence, and associated comorbidities. Chronic patients' preferences must be considered in IMIDs treatment and follow-up. The objective of this study was to further understand patient's preferences in private settings. METHODS: A literature review was performed to choose the most relevant criteria for patients. A D-efficient discrete choice experiment was designed to elicit preferences of adult patients with IMIDs and potential biological treatment prescription. Participants were collected from private practices (rheumatology, dermatology, and gastroenterology) from February to May 2022. Patients chose between option pairs, characterized by six health-care attributes, as well as monthly out-of-pocket drug price. Responses were analyzed through a conditional logit model. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients answered the questionnaire. The most frequent pathologies were Rheumatoid Arthritis (31%) and Psoriatic Arthritis (26%). The most relevant criteria were choosing the preferred physician (OR 2.25 [SD0.26]); reducing time until visit with specialist (OR 1.79 [SD0.20]), access through primary care (OR 1.60 [SD0.08]), and an increase in monthly out-of-pocket price from 100€ to 300€ (OR 0.55 [SD0.06]) and to 600€ (OR 0.08 [SD0.02]). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic IMIDs patients showed a preference toward a faster, personalized service, even with a trade-off in terms of out-of-pocket price.",1
Deactivation of Left Ventricular Assist Devices at the End of Life: Narrative Review and Ethical Framework.,"Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have become an increasingly common advanced therapy in patients with severe symptomatic heart failure. Their unique nature in prolonging life through incorporation into the circulatory system raises ethical questions regarding patient identity and values, device ontology, and treatment categorization; approaching requests for LVAD deactivation requires consideration of these factors, among others. To that end, clinicians would benefit from a deeper understanding of: 1) the history and nature of LVADs; 2) the wider context of device deactivation and associated ethical considerations; and 3) an introductory framework incorporating best practices in requests for LVAD deactivation (specifically in controversial situations without obvious medical or device-related complications). In such decisions, heart failure teams can safeguard patient preferences without compromising ethical practice through more explicit advance care planning before LVAD implantation, early integration of hospice and palliative medicine specialists (maintained throughout the disease process), and further research interrogating behaviors and attitudes related to LVAD deactivation.",0
Women's needs for lifestyle risk reduction engagement during the interconception period: a scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Unhealthy lifestyle is responsible for many chronic conditions, and antenatal engagement with women about lifestyle behaviours can be too late to prevent some adverse pregnancy outcomes and subsequent childhood risks. To reduce the risk of future adverse outcomes, the interconception period is an opportunity to implement positive health changes. The aim of this scoping review was to explore women's needs for lifestyle risk reduction engagement during the interconception period. METHODS: The JBI methodology guided our scoping review. Six databases were searched for peer-reviewed, English-language research papers published between 2010 and 2021 on topics including perceptions, attitudes, lifestyle, postpartum, preconception and interconception. Title-abstract and full text screening was independently undertaken by two authors. Included papers' reference lists were searched to find additional papers. The main concepts were then identified using a descriptive and tabular approach. RESULTS: A total of 1734 papers were screened and 33 met our inclusion criteria. Most included papers (82%, n=27) reported on nutrition and/or physical activity. Papers identified interconception through postpartum and/or preconception. Women's self-management needs for lifestyle risk reduction engagement during interconception included: informational needs, managing competing priorities, physical and mental health, self-perception and motivation, access to services and professional support, and family and peer networks. CONCLUSIONS: There is a range of challenges for women to engage in lifestyle risk reduction during interconception. To enable women's preferences for how lifestyle risk reduction activities can be enacted, issues including childcare, ongoing and tailored health professional support, domestic support, cost and health literacy need to be addressed.",0
Scoping review of values elicitation tools for treatment decisions in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment choices in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) involve consideration of tradeoffs between the benefits, toxicities, inconvenience, and costs. Stated preference elicitation methods have been used in the medical field to help evaluate complex treatment decision-making. The aim of this study was to conduct a scoping review to assess the evidence base for the use of preference elicitation tools or willingness to pay/willingness to accept methods for HCC treatment decision-making from both the patient and provider perspective. METHODS: We performed a scoping review to identify abstracts or manuscripts focused on the role preference elicitation tools or willingness to pay/willingness to accept methods for HCC treatment options among patients, caregivers, and/or providers. Two researchers independently screened full-text references and resolved conflicts through discussion. We summarized key findings, including the type and setting of preference-elicitation tools used for HCC treatment decisions. RESULTS: Ten published abstracts or manuscripts evaluated the role of preference elicitation tools for HCC treatments. The studies revealed several attributes that are considered by patients and providers making HCC treatment decisions. Many of the studies reviewed suggested that while patients place the most value on extending their overall survival, they are willing to forgo overall survival to avoid risks of treatments and maintain quality of life. Studies of physicians and surgeons found that provider preferences are dependent on patient characteristics, provider specialty, and surgeon or hospital-related factors. CONCLUSION: This scoping review explored both patient and physician preferences towards treatment modalities in all stages of HCC. The studies revealed a large scope of potential attributes that may be important to patients and that many patients are willing to forgo survival to maintain quality of life. Further research should explore both preference elicitation of currently available and emerging therapies for HCC as well as the use of this data to develop patient-facing tools to assist in navigating treatment options.",1
Patients' Preferences Towards Decision Counseling for Active Surveillance After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Esophageal Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Decision counseling (DC) is offered to enable patients to reflect on their treatment preferences and to think through the consequences of alternative treatment options. However, the timing of DC is debatable. In this study, patients who underwent DC at different times were interviewed about their experiences, specifically focusing on the timing of DC. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer eligible for participation in a prospective cohort study on active surveillance (SANO-2 study) were offered DC either before or after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). Structured interviews were conducted by phone 1 week after DC, and responses were analyzed using frequency counts for the answers to set response categories. The primary outcome was the preferred time to receive DC, while the secondary outcome was the overall experience of patients with DC. RESULTS: Overall, 40 patients were offered DC between 2021 and 2023. Patients who had counseling before the start of nCRT (n = 20) were satisfied with the timing of DC. Of the 20 patients who had DC after nCRT, 6 would have preferred counseling at an earlier time point. Patients who had DC both before or after the completion of nCRT reflected positively on DC. CONCLUSION: It is recommended to introduce the option of DC as early as possible and discuss with the patient at which moment during the decision-making process they prefer to discuss all treatment options more extensively.",0
Treatment Preferences of Adolescents and Young Adults with Depressive Symptoms: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Depression in adolescents and young adults is common and causes considerable disease burden while hampering their development, leading to adverse consequences in later life. Although treatment is available, young people are a vulnerable group regarding uptake and completion of treatment. To improve this, insight into youth's preferences for treatment is essential. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate patient preferences for depression treatment in a Dutch sample aged 16-24 years using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). METHODS: The study was conducted in The Netherlands between October 2018 and June 2019, and included 236 adolescents and young adults with current depressive symptoms or previous treatment. The DCE included five attributes (treatment type, frequency of appointment, waiting time, effectiveness, evaluation of therapeutic alliance) with corresponding levels. Results were analysed using latent class analysis. RESULTS: Results show a general preference for individual psychotherapy, treatment with high frequency, high effectiveness, short waiting time and a standard evaluation of the therapeutic alliance ('click' with the therapist) early in treatment. Latent class analysis revealed three different patterns of preferences regarding treatment type and willingness to engage in therapy. The first class showed a strong preference for individual therapy. The second class, including relatively older, higher educated and treatment-experienced participants, preferred high frequency treatment and was more open to different forms of therapy. The third class, including lower educated, younger and treatment-naïve adolescents showed reluctance to engage in therapy overall and in group therapy specifically. CONCLUSION: In this DCE, three classes could be identified that share similar preferences regarding treatment effectiveness, waiting time and evaluation of the therapeutic alliance, but varied considerably in their preference for treatment type (individual, group, or combined psychotherapy) and their willingness to engage. The results from this study may inform mental health care providers and institutions and help optimize professional care for adolescents and young adults with depressive symptoms, improving engagement in this vulnerable group.",1
A response to Al et al. Trials 2023;24:233.,"In their recent paper, Al and colleagues (Trials 2023;24:233) argue that manipulation of the methods of recruitment using well-known techniques in order to increase enrollment can be ethically acceptable. This brief response challenges that notion as an affront to voluntariness and a devolution of the ethics of human subjects research to the ""ethics"" of the marketplace.",0
What Do Rheumatology Patients Want in an After-Visit Summary? A Kano Analysis of Patient Preferences.,"BACKGROUND: After-visit summaries (AVS) are patient-specific documents curated by providers to summarize the content of medical encounters. Despite widespread use, little is known about rheumatology patient preferences for AVS content and style. The aims of this quality improvement project are to identify patient preferences and to design a rheumatology-specific AVS, using the Kano method. METHODS: This quality improvement project consists of 4 parts. First, investigators interviewed veterans and clinic staff to derive a list of potential features. Second, a Kano questionnaire assessing satisfaction with the presence or absence of each feature was distributed to veterans. Third, qualitative and quantitative Kano analyses were performed to categorize features as mandatory, performance, attractive, or indifferent. Fourthly, based on these findings, an AVS was drafted and distributed to Veterans with an associated survey to assess satisfaction with content, visual appeal, and readability. RESULTS: Nine physicians, 5 veterans, 5 schedulers, 3 nurses, and 3 medical assistants identified 15 features for inclusion in a Kano-style questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed to 50 Veterans using consecutive sampling. Quantitative Kano analysis demonstrated 4 mandatory, 2 performance, and 3 attractive features that were ultimately included in the AVS; 6 indifferent features were excluded. A postintervention survey of 50 Veterans showed high satisfaction scores in AVS content (4.3/5), visual appeal (4.6/5), and readability (4.4/5). CONCLUSIONS: We developed an AVS that included 9 mandatory, attractive, and performance features, as identified by the Kano method. Veterans were highly satisfied by the content, visual appeal, and readability of the AVS.",0
Evaluating the Feasibility of a Community Pharmacy-Delivered Behaviour Change Intervention to Reduce Reliever Reliance in Asthma.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a community pharmacy-delivered intervention to shift patients' beliefs about short-acting beta(2) agonists (SABA) in asthma management. The study targeted individual beliefs about SABA and assessed actual SABA use, focusing on reducing SABA use as well as adherence to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as a preventive measure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This non-randomized, before-and-after feasibility study enrolled participants with asthma from four community pharmacies in Auckland, New Zealand. Eligible participants were aged 18 years and above and were prescribed a SABA for their asthma. The intervention included the SABA reliance questionnaire to determine the degree of SABA reliance, verbal discussions with pharmacists personalised according to the degree of SABA reliance identified, and referral to general practitioners as appropriate. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients who consented into the study, 19 were in the control group and 16 in the intervention group. Recruitment and retention were modest, with 10 control and five intervention participants completing the 90-day follow-up. Although not statistically significant, preliminary results indicated reduced SABA reliance and increased ICS adherence in the intervention group, and reduced SABA refill. Feedback showed that 78% of intervention participants found the information easy to understand, and 56% expressed intent to consult their general practitioners. Pharmacy staff found the intervention feasible but noted time constraints as a barrier to intervention delivery. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that a community pharmacy-delivered intervention is feasible and acceptable to both patients and pharmacists. While preliminary results show a positive effect on reducing SABA reliance and improvement of ICS adherence, the results were not statistically significant due to the small numbers recruited. This suggests a larger randomised trial is indicated. This intervention holds promise for addressing the over-reliance on SABA in asthma management and improving adherence to preventive therapies.",0
Do Orthopaedic Virtual Clinic Visits Demonstrate Cost and Time Efficiencies Compared With In-person Visits?,"BACKGROUND: There are numerous reasons for the increased use of telemedicine in orthopaedic surgery, one of which is the perception that virtual visits are more cost-effective than in-person visits. However, to our knowledge, no studies have compared the cost and time investment of virtual versus in-person visits using the time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) method. Unlike methods that estimate cost based on charges for services rendered, TDABC provides a more precise measurement of costs, which is essential for assessing cost-effective innovations and moving to value-based healthcare. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Are virtual visits less costly than analogous in-person visits, as measured by TDABC? (2) Does TDABC yield cost estimates that are lower or higher than the ratio of costs to charges (RCC), which is a simple, frequently used costing method? (3) Do the total time commitments of healthcare personnel, and that of the surgeon specifically, vary between the virtual and in-person settings? METHODS: Patients for this prospective, observational study were recruited from the practices of the highest-volume virtual-visit surgeons of three subspecialties (joints, hand, and sports) in a multihospital, tertiary-care academic institution in a metropolitan area in the Midwestern United States. Each surgeon had at least 10 years of clinical practice. Between June 2021 and September 2021, we analyzed both in-person and virtual return visits with patients who had an established relationship with the surgeon, because this represented the most frequent type of virtual visits and enabled a direct comparison between the two settings. New patients were not included in the study because of the limited availability of new-patient virtual visits; such patients often benefit from in-person physical examinations and on-site imaging. Additionally, patients seen for routine postoperative care were excluded because they were primarily seen in person by a physician assistant. Data were acquired during this period until 90 in-person and 90 virtual visits were collected according to selection criteria; no patients were lost to follow-up. Distinct process maps, which represent the steps involved in a clinic visit used to measure healthcare personnel time invested, were constructed for in-person and virtual clinic visits and used to compare total personnel and surgeon time spent. To calculate TDABC-derived costs, time allocated by personnel to complete each step was measured and used to calculate cost based on each personnel member's yearly salary. From the accounting department of our hospital, we acquired RCC cost data according to the level of service for a return visit. RESULTS: The total median cost, as measured by TDABC, was USD 127 (IQR USD 111 to 163) for an in-person visit and USD 140 (IQR USD 113 to 205) for a virtual visit (median difference USD 13; p = 0.16). RCC overestimated TDABC-calculated direct variable cost in five of six service levels (in-person levels 3, 4, and 5 and virtual levels 3 and 5) by a range of USD 25 to 88. Additionally, we found that virtual visits consumed 4 minutes less of total personnel time (in-person: 17 minutes [IQR 13.5 to 23.5 minutes], virtual: 13 minutes [IQR 11 to 19 minutes]; p < 0.001); however, this difference in personnel time did not equate to cost savings because surgeons spent 2 minutes longer on virtual visit activities than they did on in-person activities (in-person: 6 minutes [IQR 4.5 to 9.5 minutes], virtual: 8 minutes [IQR 5.5 to 13 minutes]; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic virtual visits did not deliver cost savings compared with in-person visits because surgeons spent more time on virtual visits and participated in virtual visits at the clinical site. Additionally, as anticipated, RCC overestimated costs as calculated by TDABC. These findings suggest that cost is not a primary advantage of transitioning to virtual visits, and that factors such as patient preference and satisfaction should be considered instead. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, economic and decision analysis.",0
How Do We Manage Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in India.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was an ignored leukemia in India until a decade back, given its low prevalence and absence of novel drugs to treat it. Healthcare in India is heterogeneous, with variations in population, health systems, and reimbursement options. We have focused on opinions from three hemato-oncologists incorporating an opinion poll from 44 hemato-oncologists across India on the common issues in CLL to give an idea of the practice pan-India. RECENT FINDINGS: More CLL patients are being diagnosed in their early stages. There is an attempt to use prognostic and predictive markers in making shared decisions for managing CLL. There is still a role for chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) in India, given limited health insurance coverage. But with the availability of inexpensive generics, the patient preference for non-CIT options like Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors is palpable. The CLL scene in India is changing rapidly. With the wide availability of economical generic small molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and coverage by social health insurance schemes, India is poised to cater to most CLL patient needs.",0
Correlation of an Electronic Geriatric Assessment With Receipt of Adjuvant Radiation and Chemotherapy in Older Adults With Head and Neck Cancer.,"PURPOSE: Treatment patterns for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) vary among older adults because of concerns about their health status. Geriatric assessment may guide treatment for older adults with HNSCC by assessing their health status. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted a retrospective review of adjuvant treatment received by older patients with HNSCC who completed a novel geriatric assessment, the electronic Rapid Fitness Assessment, before treatment. The electronic Rapid Fitness Assessment yields an accumulated geriatric deficits (AGD) score. Higher AGD score indicates greater frailty. Comparators were age and performance status. The Wilcoxon rank sum test compared differences between those who did and did not receive adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy. RESULTS: The cohort included 73 patients, of whom 56 (77%) had oral cavity cancer. The most common geriatric deficits were major distress, social activity limitation, depression, and impaired activities of daily living. AGD score, age, and performance status were not associated with receipt of adjuvant radiation. Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy had a significantly lower median AGD score than those who did not (3 vs 6; P = .044), but there was no association with age and performance status. Of the 17 patients with newly diagnosed disease and either positive margins or extranodal extension, only 9 received adjuvant radiation and only 3 received systemic therapy. Most often, systemic therapy was omitted because of patient preference or comorbidities and poor performance status. There was a nonstatistically significant lower AGD score between patients who did and did not receive standard fractionated radiation therapy (median, 4 vs 6.5; P = .13). CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with frailty. Rates of chemotherapy utilization were very low, indicating the need for novel strategies to mitigate the toxicity burden in this patient population. Receipt of adjuvant radiation therapy was not associated with frailty; however, there was a trend toward lower frailty among those who did receive radiation therapy.",0
Disparities in health utilities among hepatitis C patients receiving care in different settings.,"BACKGROUND: Although chronic hepatitis C (CHC) disproportionately affects marginalized individuals, most health utility studies are conducted in hospital settings which are difficult for marginalized patients to access. We compared health utilities in CHC patients receiving care at hospital-based clinics and socio-economically marginalized CHC patients receiving care through a community-based program. METHODS: We recruited CHC patients from hospital-based clinics at the University Health Network and community-based sites of the Toronto Community Hep C Program, which provides treatment, support, and education to patients who have difficulty accessing mainstream health care. We elicited utilities using six standardized instruments (EuroQol-5D-3L [EQ-5D], Health Utilities Index Mark 2/Mark 3 [HUI2/HUI3], Short Form-6D [SF-6D], time trade-off [TTO], and Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to examine factors associated with differences in health utility. RESULTS: Compared with patients recruited from the hospital setting (n = 190), patients recruited from the community setting (n = 101) had higher unemployment (87% versus 67%), history of injection drug use (88% versus 42%), and history of mental health issue(s) (79% versus 46%). Unadjusted health utilities were lower in community than hospital patients (e.g., EQ-5D: 0.722 [SD 0.209] versus 0.806 [SD 0.195]). Unemployment and a history of mental health issue(s) were significant predictors of low health utility. CONCLUSIONS: Socio-economically marginalized CHC patients have lower health utilities than patients typically represented in the CHC utility literature. Their utilities should be incorporated into future cost-utility analyses to better represent the population living with CHC in health policy decisions.",1
Development of attributes and attribute levels for a discrete choice experiment on patients' and providers' choice for antiretroviral therapy service in Northwest Ethiopia.,"BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are used to assess the strength of preferences and value of interventions. However, researchers using this approach have been criticized for not conducting or publishing rigorous studies to select the required attributes and levels. Proper specification of attributes and their levels determines the validity of DCE. Hence, our study aimed to identify and define attributes and levels for the design of a DCE to elicit patients' and providers' preferences for ART service in Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: Four stages were followed to derive the final list of attributes and levels: (1) a literature review to derive conceptual attributes; (2) key informant interviews of 17 providers and in-depth interviews of 15 adult stable patients to identify context-specific attributes and attribute levels; (3) ranking survey among 31 HIV/AIDS program implementers and rating survey among 35 adult stable patients and 42 health workers providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) service to indicate participants' preference of attributes; and (4) an expert opinion to reduce the list of attributes and levels. RESULTS: First, a literature review identified 23 candidate attributes. Second, individual-level analysis of the qualitative transcripts confirmed 15 of these 23 attributes. Third, the ranking and rating surveys put the importance of the 23 ART service attributes in order of preference. Fourth, through discussions with eight experts, 17 attributes were discarded based on multiple criteria. The six retained attributes were: the location of ART refills, the frequency of receiving ART refills, the person providing ART refills, the participants/others seen at the same ART refill visit, medication refill pick-up/delivery times, and the total cost of the visit during antiretroviral (ARV) medication refill. Finally, levels were assigned to these 6 attributes based on data from the literature, transcripts, and knowledge of the Ethiopian context. CONCLUSIONS: This detailed description illuminates the attribute development process and provides the reader with a basis for evaluating the rigor of this phase of DCE construction. This paper contributes empirical evidence to the limited methodological literature on attributes and levels of development for DCE, thereby providing further empirical guidance on ART service preference, specifically among patients of low- and middle-income countries.",1
Cancer patients' experiences and preferences when receiving bad news: a qualitative study.,"PURPOSE: Receiving a cancer diagnosis significantly impacts patients' lives, and how the bad news is delivered influences patients' trajectory, psychosocial adjustment and openness to psycho-oncological support. We explored how patients' experiences, reactions and preferences were when receiving the news and which optimization recommendations can be made. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study with patients who enrolled in the new integrated cross-sectoral psycho-oncological care programme 'isPO', being enrolled 12 months post-diagnosis. Data on the main issue (i.e. perception of the moment when the diagnosis is received) were collected via telephone interviews that were fully audiotaped and transcribed. Two independent coders conducted inductive content analyses using MAXQDA. RESULTS: Out of 38 approached patients, 23 cancer patients with 13 different tumour entities participated. They had a mean age of 54.2 (SD 16.2); n = 17 (74%) were female. Three major themes with 14 corresponding subthemes emerged: (1) patients' experiences with the bad news delivery, including setting, mode, preparation and perceived needs; (2) patients' reactions to the bad news, such as shock, fear and helplessness, disbelief and denial, anger and feeling of injustice, thankfulness and depression; and (3) patients' receiving preferences, including psycho-oncological support, addressing informational needs, needs-driven comprehensive support and a competent multidisciplinary support team. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of bad news delivery and addressing patients' needs should be strongly considered by physicians. We recommend integrating patients' perspective on the quality management processes of breaking bad news. For providing needs-centred high-quality care, applying existing guidelines and acquiring patient-centred communication skills are central.",0
'CROSS'-ing into the 'Real World': a retrospective cohort study of patients receiving trimodality and bimodality therapy for esophageal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: A standard of care for nonmetastatic esophageal cancer is trimodality therapy consisting of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and esophagectomy, with evidence for improved overall survival versus surgery alone in the ChemoRadiotherapy for Oesophageal cancer followed by Surgery Study (CROSS) trial. Patients who receive treatment with curative intent but are poor candidates for or decline surgery receive definitive bimodality therapy. Literature characterizing patients who receive bimodality therapy compared to trimodality therapy, and their relative outcomes, is sparse, especially among patients who are too old or too frail to qualify for clinical trials. In this study, we assess a single-institution real-world dataset of patients receiving bimodality and trimodality management. METHODS: Patients treated for clinically resectable, nonmetastatic esophageal cancer between 2009 and 2019 who received bimodality or trimodality therapy were reviewed, generating a dataset of 95 patients. Clinical variables and patient characteristics were assessed for association with modality on multivariable logistic regression. Overall, relapse-free, and disease-free survival were assessed with Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional modeling. For patients nonadherent to planned esophagectomy, reasons for nonadherence were recorded. RESULTS: Bimodality therapy was associated with greater age-adjusted comorbidity index, worse performance status, higher N-stage, presenting symptom other than dysphagia, and held chemotherapy cycles on multivariable analysis. Compared to bimodality therapy, trimodality therapy was associated with higher overall (3-year: 62% vs. 18%, P<0.001), relapse-free (3-year: 71% vs. 18%, P<0.001), and disease-free (3-year: 58% vs. 12%, P<0.001) survival. Similar results were observed among patients who did not meet CROSS trial qualifying criteria. Only treatment modality was associated with overall survival after adjusting for covariates (HR 0.37, P<0.001, reference group: bimodality). Patient choice accounted for 40% of surgery nonadherence in our population. CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving trimodality therapy were observed to have superior overall survival compared to bimodality therapy. Patient preference for organ-preserving therapies appears to impact resection rate; further characterization of patient decision-making may be helpful. Our results suggest patients who wish to prioritize overall survival should be encouraged to pursue trimodality therapy and obtain early consultation with surgery. Development of evidence-based interventions to physiologically prepare patients before and during neoadjuvant therapy as well as efforts to optimize the tolerability of the chemoradiation plan are warranted.",0
Patient's preferences: an unmet need by current urolithiasis guidelines: a systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION: Shared decision making (SDM) in surgical specialties was demonstrated to diminish decisional regret, decisional anxiety and decisional conflict. Urolithiasis guidelines do not explicit patient preference to choose treatment. The aim of this review article was to perform a systematic evaluation of published evidence regarding SDM in urinary stone treatment. METHODS: A systematic review in accordance PRISMA checklist was conducted using the MEDLINE (PubMed) database. Inclusion criteria were studies that evaluated stone treatment preferences. Reviews, editorials, case reports and video abstracts were excluded. ROBUST checklist was used to assess quality of the studies. RESULTS: 188 articles were obtained. After applying the predefined selection criteria, seven articles were included for final analysis. Six out of seven studies were questionnaires that propose clinical scenarios and treatment alternatives. The last study was a patient preference trial. A general trend among included studies showed a patient preference towards the least invasive option (SWL over URS). The main reasons to choose one treatment over the other were stone-free rates, risk of complications and invasiveness. DISCUSSION: This review provides an overview of the patients' preferences towards stone treatment in small- and medium-sized stones. There was a clear preference towards the least invasive management strategy. The main reason was less invasiveness. This is opposed to the global trends of performing more ureteroscopies and less SWL. Physicians played a pivotal role in counselling patients. SDM should be encouraged and improved. The main limitation of this study is the characteristics of the included studies.",1
Beyond satisfaction in person-centered pharmacy services.,"Patient self-reported satisfaction is commonly used as an assessment of service experience and quality for community pharmacy services. This commentary discusses alternative foundational approaches to evaluating service experience and quality in patient-centered care. It describes historical and recent literature pertaining to the development and use of satisfaction measures for service design and patient experience assessment. It then highlights potential limitations of patient satisfaction as an assessment tool for patient-centeredness and patient experience identified in the pharmacy literature, which include criticisms that use of patient satisfaction may compromise accuracy in measuring quality due to factors such as patients having poor knowledge of and low expectations for quality and having a predisposition toward rating satisfaction highly when experiencing no-cost and/or unfamiliar services. Moreover, satisfaction measurements may change based on service exposure, with patient preferences for service offerings changing with increased service exposure and variation in patient-specific and environmental factors. After discussing limitations and criticism of patient self-reported satisfaction, we introduce alternative assessments methods which may facilitate more accurate assessments of patient experience and patient-centered pharmacy services such as patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs), patient-reported experience measures (PREMs), and human-centered design techniques such as journey mapping, prototyping, and user testing to design and assess patient-centered pharmacy services. These alternative assessments are rooted in, or related to preferred implementation science approaches to establishing, evaluating, and sustaining pharmacy services.",0
Balancing benefits and risks in lung cancer therapies: patient preferences for lung cancer treatment alternatives.,"BACKGROUND: In the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) the combination of Immuno- Oncotherapy (IO) and chemotherapy (CT) has been found to be superior to IO or CT alone for patients' survival. Patients and clinicians are confronted with a preference sensitive choice between a more aggressive treatment with a greater negative effect on quality of life versus alternatives that are less effective but have fewer side effects. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to: (a) quantify patients' preferences for relevant attributes related to Immuno-Oncotherapy treatment alternatives, and (b) evaluate the maximum acceptable risk (MAR)/Minimum acceptable benefit (MAB) that patients would accept for treatment alternatives. METHODS: An online preference survey using discrete-choice experiment (DCE) was completed by NSCLC patients from two hospitals in Italy and Belgium. The survey asked patients' preferences for five patient- relevant treatment attributes. The DCE was developed using a Bayesian D-efficient design. DCE analyses were performed using mixed logit models. Information regarding patient demographics, health literacy, locus of control, and quality of life was also collected. RESULTS: 307 patients (158 Italian, 149 Belgian), stage I to IV, completed the survey. Patients preferred treatments with a higher 5-year survival chance as the most important attribute over all the other attributes. Preference heterogeneity for the attribute weights depended on health literacy, patients' age and locus of control. Patients were willing to accept a substantially increased risks of developing side effects in exchange for the slightest increase (1%) in the chance of surviving at least 5 years from the diagnosis of cancer. Similarly, patients were willing to accept a switch in the mode of administration or complete loss of hair to obtain an increase in survival. CONCLUSION: In this study, the proportion of respondents who systematically preferred survival over all other treatment attributes was particularly high. Age, objective health literacy and locus of control accounted for heterogeneity in patients' preferences. Evidence on how NSCLC patients trade between survival and other NSCLC attributes can support regulators and other stakeholders on assessing clinical trial evidence and protocols, based on patients' conditions and socio-demographic parameters.",1
Citizen attitudes to non-treatment decision making: a Norwegian survey.,"BACKGROUND: Decisions about appropriate treatment at the end of life are common in modern healthcare. Non-treatment decisions (NTDs), comprising both withdrawal and withholding of (potentially) life-prolonging treatment are in principle accepted in Norway. However, in practice they may give rise to significant moral problems for health professionals, patients and next of kin. Here, patient values must be considered. It is relevant to study the moral views and intuitions of the general population on NTDs and special areas of contention such as the role of next of kin in decision-making. METHODS: Electronic survey to members of a nationally representative panel of Norwegian adults. Respondents were presented with vignettes describing patients with disorders of consciousness, dementia, and cancer where patient preferences varied. Respondents answered ten questions about the acceptability of non-treatment decision making and the role of next of kin. RESULTS: We received 1035 complete responses (response rate 40.7%). A large majority, 88%, supported the right of competent patients to refuse treatment in general. When an NTD was in line with the patient's previously expressed preferences, more respondents tended to find NTDs acceptable. More respondents would accept NTDs for themselves than for the vignette patients. In a scenario with an incompetent patient, clear majorities wanted the views of next of kin to be given some but not decisive weight, and more weight if concordant with the patient's wishes. There were, however, large variations in the respondents' views. CONCLUSION: This survey of a representative sample of the Norwegian adult population indicates that attitudes to NTDs are often in line with national laws and guidelines. However, the high variance among the respondents and relatively large weight given to next of kin's views, indicate a need for appropriate dialogue among all stakeholders to prevent conflicts and extra burdens. Furthermore, the emphasis given to previously expressed opinions indicates that advance care planning may increase the legitimacy of NTDs and prevent challenging decision-making processes.",0
Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection Versus Surgery or Endoscopic Mucosal Resection for Metachronous Early Gastric Cancer: a Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Resection options for early gastric cancer (EGC) include endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), and surgery. In patients with metachronous EGC following previous resection, the optimal resection technique is not well elucidated. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing ESD to EMR, or ESD to surgery, in patients with metachronous EGC. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of studies reporting on outcomes and AEs following ESD versus either EMR or surgery for patients with metachronous EGC. Pooled odds ratios (OR) of included studies were obtained using DerSimonian and Laird random effects models. Funnel plots were produced and visually inspected for evidence of publication bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS: A total of 9367 abstracts were screened and 10 observational studies were included. The odds of complete resection were higher amongst patients undergoing ESD compared to EMR (OR 5.88, 95% confidence intervals, CI, 1.79-19.35), whereas the odds of complete resection were no different between ESD and surgery (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.04-8.24). There were no differences in the odds of local recurrence with ESD versus surgery (OR 5.01, 95% CI 0.86-29.13). Post-procedural bleeding did not differ significantly between ESD and EMR (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.16-3.00). There was no evidence of publication bias. DISCUSSION: For metachronous EGC, ESD or surgery is preferred over EMR depending on local expertise and patient preferences, largely due to a higher risk of incomplete resection with EMR.

Investigation of predictors influencing patient-pharmacist relationship establishment.,"BACKGROUND: A strong patient-pharmacist relationship is tied to patients' trust and confidence in pharmacists and pharmacy services. While past research has described patient-pharmacist relationship archetypes (i.e., ""customer,"" ""client,"" ""partner"") with potential to help pharmacists initially understand patients' preferences and expectations of care and services, little is known about potential factors that underlie these preferences and expectations. OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to [1] compare the prevalence of the current and desired patient-pharmacist relationships archetypes reported by patients and [2] identify the sociodemographic, health, and medication use and procurement factors predictive of the archetypes representing patients' current relationship with outpatient pharmacists. METHODS: Data from 1521 patients were collected via the 2021 National Consumer Survey on Medication Experience and Pharmacists' Role. Patient-pharmacist relationship distribution across patients' sociodemographic characteristics was explored using crosstabulations. Multinomial logistic regression was also used to investigate the association between patient sociodemographic characteristics and the current patient-pharmacist archetype relationships. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 53.9 years and 57.3% were married. Thirty-two percent of the patients reported currently having a ""Customer"" relationship, while 17.9% and 15.2% reported having a ""Client"" and ""Partner"" archetype relationship, respectively. ""Client"" (25.2%) and ""Partner"" (20.2%) relationships were the most commonly preferred archetypal relationships. The odds ratios (OR) of having ""Client"" or ""Partner"" relationships increased with the number of patients' health conditions and medications. Patients who visited independently owned and clinic pharmacies had a higher OR of building professional relationships with a pharmacist. CONCLUSION: The qualities of a patient-pharmacist relationship may be associated with key patient characteristics. Pharmacists can build relationships with patients informed by a continuum of patient preferences, expectations, and needs to optimize health outcomes.",0
Physicians approach shared decision-making for sports eligibility decisions heterogeneously.,"BACKGROUND: There is limited data regarding how clinicians operationalize shared decision-making (SDM) with athletes with cardiovascular diagnoses. This study was designed to explore sports cardiologists' conceptions of SDM and approaches to sports eligibility decisions. METHODS: 20 sports cardiologists were interviewed by telephone or video conference from October 2022 to May 2023. Qualitative descriptive analysis was conducted with the transcripts. RESULTS: All participants endorsed SDM for eligibility decisions, however, SDM was defined and operationalized heterogeneously. Only 6 participants specifically referenced eliciting patient preferences during SDM. Participants described variable roles for the physician in SDM and variable views on athletes' understanding, perception, and tolerance of risk. Participants thresholds for prohibitive annual risk of sudden cardiac death ranged from <1 % to >10 %. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reinforce the general acceptance of SDM for sports eligibility decisions and highlight the need to better understand this process and identify the most effective approach for operationalization.",0
Analysis of patients' thoughts and background factors influencing attitudes toward Deprescribing: interviews to obtain hints for highly satisfying and valid prescriptions.,"BACKGROUND: Prescribing with high levels of medical appropriateness and patient satisfaction improves adherence. However, its appropriateness does not always match patient preference. Deprescription is important for ensuring the safety of medication therapy, but is not straightforward. Although successful deprescribing requires knowledge of patients' thoughts on their prescriptions and factors that influence their acceptance of deprescribing, few comprehensive studies have been conducted on this topic. The aim of this study was to identify factors that influence patients' attitudes toward deprescribing and obtain hints on how to achieve higher patient satisfaction and prescribing adequacy. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to hospitalized patients and a logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine factors that influence their attitude toward deprescribing. Individual factors affecting patients' thoughts and wishes regarding prescribing were extracted and analysed in detail. RESULTS: The analysis included 106 patients, of whom 40 (37.7%) wished deprescribing. Logistic regression analysis showed that ""Age"", ""Wish to reduce the number and types of medications"", ""Satisfaction"", ""Concerns about side effects"", and ""Wish not to have certain medications changed"" were factors influencing attitudes toward deprescribing. The results suggested that the factors were influenced by patients' perceptions and individual patient backgrounds. There was a gap between willingness to reduce medication and to change their medications. Seventy-eight percent of all respondents indicated that they would like to reduce the number and type of pills they take if possible. However, only 44.6% of these patients indicated that they would actually like to change their medication. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the only one to comprehensively investigate prescription content, patient background, and patients' thoughts on factors influencing attitudes toward deprescribing. This study revealed five factors that can influence inclination toward deprescribing. In addition, the results suggest that patients want to be able to feel well with fewer medications if possible. This information may be useful in determining prescriptions that have high validity and patient satisfaction. Further research is needed on the gap between willingness to reduce medications and to change medications.",0
Patient Preferences in Metastatic Breast Cancer Care: A Scoping Review.,"People with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) have diverse medical, physical, and psychosocial needs that require multidimensional care. Understanding patient preferences is crucial to tailor treatments, services, and foster patient-centered care. A scoping review was performed to summarize the current evidence on the preferences of people with MBC regarding their care to identify knowledge gaps and key areas for future research. The Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycInfo databases were searched. Twenty studies enrolling 3354 patients met the study eligibility criteria. Thirteen quantitative studies, four mixed methods studies, and three qualitative studies were included. Seven studies captured healthcare provider perspectives; thirteen studies evaluated patient preferences relating specifically to cancer treatments; three studies evaluated preferences relating to supportive care; and four studies evaluated communication and decision-making preferences. The current literature evaluating MBC patient preferences is heterogeneous with a focus on cancer treatments. Future research should explore patient preferences relating to multidisciplinary, multi-modal care that aims to improve quality of life. Understanding MBC patient preferences regarding their comprehensive care can help tailor healthcare delivery, enhance the patient experience, and improve outcomes.",1
Videoconferencing of Movement-Based and Psychologically Informed Interventions for Chronic Pain: A Systematic Review and Horizon Scan.,"Introduction: With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, use of telehealth technology increased dramatically. Nonpharmacological approaches to pain management may be well suited for virtual care. Yet, it is not widely understood if this treatment modality is effective when delivered via videoconferencing. This review examines the effectiveness of movement-based and psychologically informed chronic pain management interventions delivered via videoconferencing compared to in-person care. Methods: Searches of MEDLINE(®) (via Ovid(®)), Embase (via Elsevier), CINAHL Complete (via EBSCO), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (via Ovid) were performed from inception to June 10, 2021. All articles meeting eligibility criteria were included for data abstraction. Results: Eight thousand two hundred fifty-two citations were identified, and after removing duplicates, 4,661 citations remained. One study investigating acceptance and commitment therapy met eligibility criteria. The noninferiority randomized trial found no statistically significant difference in outcomes between delivery modalities. A horizon scan was conducted to assess planned or recent studies. Horizon scan results yielded six protocols in trial databases, one pilot study, and three published protocols for ongoing studies. Discussion: Findings from this study indicate that virtually delivered pain management is a possible substitute for in-person care. Given the paucity of evidence on this topic, further comparative and adequately powered studies that assess the impact of movement-based and psychologically informed pain management delivered via videoconferencing are needed. Conclusions: Research is needed to understand patient preferences of such interventions within a variety of settings. Such evaluations will be needed to guide clinical and operations practice to optimize equitable deployment and access to high-quality health care delivered via videoconferencing.",0
Treatment preferences among patients with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis.,"Study purpose: New treatments for atopic dermatitis (AD) are emerging; however, little is known about the treatment preferences of patients with mild-to-moderate AD. To measure patients' preferences, a cross-sectional, web-based discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey was developed and administered to 300 adults in the United States with a self-reported physician diagnosis of mild-to-moderate AD.Materials and methods: In the DCE, respondents evaluated pairs of hypothetical AD treatment profiles defined by efficacy, risk, and mode and frequency of administration attributes. The DCE data were analyzed using a random parameters logit model. Subgroup analysis was used to investigate preference heterogeneity.Results: The results revealed achieving clear or almost clear skin within 3-4 months of treatment was the most important attribute relative to all other study attributes. The results indicated that a topical cream applied twice daily was preferred to systemic treatments. Subgroup analysis revealed that respondents with lower self-assessed disease burden were more likely to choose topical over systemic treatments and less averse to the risk of pain, burning, and/or stinging from the medicine (all other treatment features remaining equal) than respondents with higher self-assessed disease burden.Conclusion: The results of this study can help inform shared decision-making to manage mild-to-moderate AD.",1
Collagenase Treatment Versus Needle Fasciotomy for Single-Digit Dupuytren Contractures: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"PURPOSE: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the available randomized controlled trial data comparing needle fasciotomy and collagenase treatment for single-digit Dupuytren contractures with a minimum of 3-year follow-up and determine whether one treatment is superior regarding contracture correction and functional outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching four databases for randomized controlled trials investigating the single-digit treatment outcomes for Dupuytren contracture comparing collagenase treatment and needle fasciotomy with a minimum of 3-year follow-up. The risk of bias of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model in anticipation of unobserved heterogeneity. The primary outcome measure was contracture recurrence. Secondary outcome measures included final fixed flexion contracture (FFC), Quick Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) scores, and Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main (URAM) scores. RESULTS: After screening 264 articles, 4 randomized clinical trials were eligible for final inclusion. One trial had a high risk of bias, and two trials had some concern for bias. The final meta-analysis included 347 patients, 169 who underwent collagenase treatment and 178 who underwent needle fasciotomy. No significant differences were noted between the groups in contracture recurrence, FFC, and URAM scores. The pooled data showed a higher QuickDASH score in the collagenase treatment group compared with the needle fasciotomy group, but the observed difference was less than what would be expected to be clinically relevant. CONCLUSIONS: Needle fasciotomy and collagenase treatment have similar outcomes with regards to contracture recurrence, final FFC, QuickDASH scores, and URAM scores for the single-digit treatment for Dupuytren contracture at a minimum of 3-year follow-up. Relevant factors that may be considered during the shared decision-making process for treatment selection include surgeon and patient preferences, costs of treatment, and the disparate complication profiles of these two treatments. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic II.",0
Telemedicine Satisfaction and Preferences in an Orthopaedic Spine Clinic.,"The use of telemedicine has expanded amid the COVID-19 pandemic and office closures and cancellation of elective surgeries early in the pandemic helped propagated its use. Previous studies have described the feasibility of telemedicine, however, little has been reported on patient perception and preferences within orthopaedics. The objective of this study was to evaluate satisfaction and preferences of telemedicine from the perspective of patients within an orthopaedic spine clinic. A cross-sectional, anonymous survey was implemented as a prospective quality improvement initiative. The survey was sent to patients who had an in-office or telemedicine visit with a provider in our orthopaedic spine clinic. Statistical analysis was performed on the results of the survey. The survey was sent to 1129 patients and a total of 316 patients responded. Twenty-one percent of respondents had a telemedicine appointment. There was no difference in satisfaction among groups (P = .288) and those with telemedicine appointments were more likely to have had a previous experience with this type of visit (P = .004) and were more inclined to use it in the future (P < .001). Patients preferred telemedicine because of the ability to get earlier appointments (P < .001) and the convenience of the visits (P < .001). Patients preferred in-office visits because they received hands-on physical exams (P = .003) or imaging (P = .041). Telemedicine is a viable alternative to in-office appointments for spine patients, as evidenced by similar levels of patient satisfaction. Sooner appointments and convenience are attractive elements of telemedicine visits, while the desire for physical examination remains a barrier to adoption in this population.",0
Physical function and severe side effects matter most to patients with RA (< 5 years): a discrete choice experiment assessing preferences for personalized RA treatment.,"AIM: Early assessment of patient preferences has the potential to support shared decisions in personalized precision medicine for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to assess treatment preferences of patients with RA (< 5 years) with previous experience of inadequate response to first-line monotherapy. METHOD: Patients were recruited (March-June 2021) via four clinics in Sweden. Potential respondents (N = 933) received an invitation to answer a digital survey. The survey included an introductory part, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and demographic questions. Each respondent answered 11 hypothetical choice questions as part of the DCE. Patient preferences and preference heterogeneity were estimated using random parameter logit models and latent class analysis models. RESULTS: Patients (n = 182) assessed the most important treatment attributes out of physical functional capacity, psychosocial functional capacity, frequency of mild side effects and likelihood of severe side effects. In general, patients preferred a greater increase in functional capacity and decreased side effects. However, a substantial preference heterogeneity was identified with two underlying preference patterns. The most important attribute in the first pattern was the 'likelihood of getting a severe side effect'. Physical functional capacity was the most important attribute in the second pattern. CONCLUSION: Respondents focused their decision-making mainly on increasing their physical functional capacity or decreasing the likelihood of getting a severe side effect. These results are highly relevant from a clinical perspective to strengthen communication in shared decision making by assessing patients' individual preferences for benefits and risks in treatment discussions.",1
Quality of breaking bad news to patients diagnosed with neoplasia of the uterine cervix.,"OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the quality of receiving bad news (BN) for women diagnosed with cervical neoplasia. We evaluated adherence to the SPIKES protocol in three cohorts of women with different stages of the disease and treatment modalities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included women with cervical cancer who underwent radical vaginal trachelectomy (RVT group, n = 110), radical hysterectomy or chemo-radiation (HE/RCT group, n = 101), and women with CIN 3 treated by loop excision (CIN group, n = 108). We asked the participants about how they received the bad news delivery in reality and how they would envision an ideal communication process based on the main items of the SPIKES protocol. The participants filled out a questionnaire with 38 items of the Marburg Breaking Bad News (MABBAN) Scale representing the six SPIKES subscales. RESULTS: Only 72% of all patients reported being satisfied with their BBN experience. The following factors were considered important by 90% of the patients: an undisturbed atmosphere, taking enough time, coherent explanation of the disease, and the possibility to ask questions. However, the reality of their experiences fell significantly short of their expectations. Asking about the patient's knowledge of the disease, addressing their concerns, allowing them to show emotions, providing clarity about the change in quality of life, informing them about alternative therapies, and involving them in further planning were also significantly lacking in the actual BBN encounters compared to the patients' preferences. The experience of RVT patients was more negative compared to the HE/RCT patients (p = 0.036). The CIN patients had an overall satisfactory impression (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The process of breaking bad news in German women diagnosed with cervical neoplasia requires substantial improvement. The SPIKES protocol can be used as a guideline for enhancement but should be supplemented by incorporating a second consultation as the norm rather than the exception. Continuous monitoring and improvement of the quality of BBN is recommended for all oncologic institutions, utilizing the MABBAN questionnaire as a valuable tool.",0
"Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Surgery, Lasers, and Emerging Techniques.","Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that is characterized by painful nodules, abscesses and tunnels in skin folds. Current management of HS often requires a multidisciplinary approach, including medical, procedural, surgical, and psychosocial intervention. Here we review surgical techniques for the treatment of HS. While many surgical options are available for patients with HS, it is imperative that surgical planning focuses on medical optimization, patient risk factors, disease severity, and patient preferences to achieve the best outcomes.",0
Changes to Birth Plans Due to COVID-19: A Survey of Utah Midwives and Doulas.,"INTRODUCTION: This study seeks to understand the experiences of Utah midwives and doulas caring for patients during the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Specifically, the goal of the study was to describe the perceived impact on the community birth system and explore differences in the access and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) between in- and out-of-hospital births. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive study design. A 26-item survey developed by the research team was sent via email to Utah birth workers, including nurse-midwives, community midwives, and doulas. Quantitative data were collected during December 2020 and January 2021. Descriptive statistics were used in the analysis. RESULTS: Of the 409 birth workers who were sent a link to the survey, 120 (30%) responded: 38 (32%) CNMs, 30 (25%) direct-entry or community midwives, and 52 (43%) doulas. The majority (79%) reported changes to clinical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Community midwives (71%) who responded indicated practice volume increased. Survey participants reported an increased patient preference for home births (53%) and birth center births (43%). Among those with one or more patient transfers to the hospital, 61% experienced a change in the process. One participant reported that it took 43 minutes longer to transfer to the hospital. Community midwives and doulas reported poor access to a regular source of PPE. DISCUSSION: Survey participants reported changes to planned birth locations during the COVID-19 pandemic. When necessary, transfers to hospitals were reported to be slower. Community midwives and doulas reported having insufficient access to PPE and reported limited knowledge about COVID-19 testing resources and resources for educating patients on COVID-19. This study adds an important perspective to the existing literature on COVID-19 by indicating that policymakers should include community birth partners in community planning for natural disasters and future pandemics.",0
An update on absolute and relative indications for dialysis treatment modalities.,"BACKGROUND: Choosing a dialysis modality is an important decision for people to make as their kidney failure progresses. In doing so, their options should be informed by any absolute or relative indications that may favour one modality over another. METHODS: In creating this update, we reviewed literature using a framework that considered first, high-level outcomes (survival and modality transition) from large registry data and cohort studies when considering optimal patient pathways; second, factors at a dialysis provider level that might affect relative indications; and third, specific patient-level factors. Both main types of dialysis modality, peritoneal (PD) and haemodialysis (HD), and their subtypes were considered. RESULTS: For most people starting dialysis, survival is independent of modality, including those with diabetes. Better survival is seen in those with less comorbidity starting with PD or home HD, reflecting continued improvements over recent decades that have been greater than improvements seen for centre HD. There are provider-level differences in the perceived relative indications for home dialysis that appear to reflect variability in experience, prejudice, enthusiasm, and support for patients and carers. Absolute contraindications are uncommon and, in most cases, where modality prejudice exists, e.g. obesity, Adult Polycystic Kidney Disease, and social factors, this is not supported by reported outcomes. CONCLUSION: Absolute contraindications to a particular dialysis modality are rare. Relative indications for or against particular modalities should be considered but are rarely more important than patient preferences.",0
Early Pregnancy Loss Management in the Emergency Department vs Outpatient Setting.,"IMPORTANCE: Early pregnancy loss (EPL), or miscarriage, is the most common complication of early pregnancy, and many patients experiencing EPL present to the emergency department (ED). Little is known about how patients who present to the ED with EPL differ from those who present to outpatient clinics and how their management and outcomes differ. OBJECTIVE: To compare the management and outcomes of patients with EPL who present to the ED vs outpatient clinics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used the IBM MarketScan Research Database, a national insurance claims database. Participants were pregnant people aged 15 to 49 years in the US who presented to either an ED or outpatient clinic for initial diagnosis of EPL from October 2015 through December 2019. Data analysis was performed from May 2021 to March 2022. EXPOSURES: The primary exposure was location of service (ED vs outpatient clinic). Other exposures of interest included demographic characteristics, current pregnancy history, and comorbidities. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was EPL management type (surgical, medication, or expectant management). Complications, including blood transfusion and hospitalization, and characteristics associated with location of service were also evaluated. Bivariable analyses and multivariable logistic regression were used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 117 749 patients with EPL diagnoses were identified, with a mean (SD) age of 31.8 (6.1) years. Of these patients, 20 826 (17.7%) initially presented to the ED, and 96 923 (82.3%) presented to outpatient clinics. Compared with the outpatient setting, patients in the ED were less likely to receive surgical (2925 patients [14.0%] vs 23 588 patients [24.3%]) or medication (1116 patients [5.4%] vs 10 878 patients [11.2%]) management. In the adjusted analysis, characteristics associated with decreased odds of active (surgical or medication) vs expectant management included ED (vs outpatient) presentation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.44-0.47), urban location (aOR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82-0.91), and being a dependent on an insurance policy (vs primary policy holder) (aOR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.67-0.74); whereas older age (aOR per 1-year increase 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.01), established prenatal care (aOR, 2.35; 95% CI, 2.29-2.42), and medical comorbidities (aOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09) were associated with increased odds of receiving active management. Patients in the ED were more likely than those in outpatient clinics to need a blood transfusion (287 patients [1.4%] vs 202 patients [0.2%]) or hospitalization (463 patients [2.2%] vs 472 patients [0.5%]), but complications were low regardless of location of service. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of privately insured patients with EPL, differences in management between the ED vs outpatient setting may reflect barriers to accessing comprehensive EPL management options. More research is needed to understand these significant differences in management approaches by practice setting, and to what extent EPL management reflects patient preferences in both outpatient and ED settings.",0
"A cross-sectional study evaluating the knowledge, attitude, and practice of evidence-based medicine among resident doctors of a health-care Institution of National Importance in India.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promotes the integration of updated- best evidence with patient preferences and medical expertise for clinical decision-making. Despite the availability of high-quality evidence such as systematic review and meta-analysis, some clinicians manage their patients based on past experiences and expert opinion. Thus, this study was proposed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of EBM among resident doctors at a tertiary care hospital in India. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted among senior residents and final-year postgraduates (PGs) who were independently involved in clinical decision-making. By convenience sampling method, the participants were recruited, and the validated EBM Questionnaire (EBMQ) was distributed online for assessing the knowledge, attitude, and practice of EBM. Descriptive statistics were represented as frequency and proportions. RESULTS: A total of 102 resident doctors participated with male preponderance (74.5%). Nearly, 96 (94.1%) participants were already practicing EBM and 21.6% had undergone EBM training. Textbooks (50%) were the most often referred sources for EBM information. Specific EBM databases such as MEDLINE and Cochrane were also utilized by 37.3% of participants. More than 70% of participants understood the terms such as a randomized controlled trial, case-control study, and P value. A higher proportion (80.4%) of participants showed a positive attitude about patient care improved by EBM. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the resident doctors exhibited good knowledge and a positive attitude toward applying EBM in clinical decision-making. Periodic training through workshops or courses and integration of EBM with the PG curriculum would potentially enhance the EBM practice.",0

Interest in advance provision of abortion pills: a national survey of potential users in the USA.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess interest in clinician-administered advance provision of abortion pills among potential users in the USA. METHODS: Using social media advertisements, we recruited people living in the USA who were aged 18-45 years and assigned female at birth, who were not pregnant or planning pregnancy, for an online survey on reproductive health experiences and attitudes. We explored interest in advance provision of abortion pills, participant characteristics, including demographics and pregnancy history, contraceptive use, abortion knowledge and comfort, and healthcare system distrust. We used descriptive statistics to assess interest in advance provision, and ordinal regression modelling to evaluate differences in interest controlling for age, pregnancy history, contraceptive use, familiarity and comfort with medication abortion, and healthcare system distrust, reporting adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: From January-February 2022, we recruited 634 diverse respondents from 48 states, among whom 65% were interested, 12% neutral, and 23% disinterested in advance provision. There were no differences among interest groups by US region, race/ethnicity, or income. In the model, variables associated with interest included being aged 18-24 years (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.4) versus 35-45 years, using a tier 1 (permanent or long-acting reversible) or tier 2 (short-acting hormonal) contraceptive method (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.1, and aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.9, respectively) versus no contraception, being familiar or comfortable with the medication abortion process (aOR 4.2, 95% CI 2.8 to 6.2, and aOR 17.1, 95% CI 10.0 to 29.0, respectively), and having high healthcare system distrust (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.4) versus low distrust. CONCLUSION: As abortion access becomes more constrained, strategies are needed to ensure timely access. Advance provision is of interest to the majority of those surveyed and warrants further policy and logistical exploration.",0
How should patient decision aids for schizophrenia treatment be designed? - A scoping review.,"Despite the clear rationale for applying shared decision-making in the context of the preference sensitive decision for or against antipsychotics and the upswing of patient decision aids (pDAs) to support this process, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding which key features are crucial for pDAs in schizophrenia treatment. A scoping review according to the PRISMA-SRc was conducted to inform on crucial key features and quality indicators. The review focussed on the following seven aspects for investigating pDAs: (1) Types of decision aids, (2) Values, (3) Decision Guidance, (4) Output of the decision aid, (5) Target group, (6) Effectiveness according to publication and (7) Decision aid evaluation. Eleven studies which addressed six unique decision aids met the eligibility criteria. There were major differences in the design as well as in the development of the decision aids. Three aspects emerged that should be given special consideration in the design of such tools for antipsychotics: the evidence used by the decision aid, the algorithm for translating evidence into a decision aid and finally the presentation of the evidence. We recommend the use of data with a high level of evidence and to combine it with individualized treatment by taking into account patient preferences and previous experiences as well as comparing them with clinical assessments. Fully computerized decision aids that use complicated algorithms, for example, by merging treatment effects with patient characteristics to suggest an appropriate treatment at the end, tend to be paternalistic and thus not appropriate for SDM, in our view. In addition, possible cognitive deficits need to be considered when presenting the output of decision aids for antipsychotics.",0
Perspectives of hospitalized heart failure patients: preferred and perceived participation roles in treatment decisions.,"Shared decision-making (SDM) is a pivotal process in seeking optimal individual treatment and incorporating clinical evidence and patients' autonomous preferences. However, patients' actual attitudes toward participation in decision-making for state-of-the-art heart failure (HF) treatment remain unclear. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey distributed by nurses and physicians specializing in HF care to assess patients' preferred and perceived participation roles in treatment decision-making during the index hospitalization, rated on five scales (from extremely passive to purely autonomous attitudes). Simultaneously, we investigated the important factors underlying treatment decision-making from the perspective of hospitalized HF patients. Of the 202 patients who were approached by our multidisciplinary HF team between 2017 and 2020, 166 (82.2%) completed the survey. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the clinical determinants of patients who reported that they left all decisions to physicians (i.e., extremely passive attitude). Of the 166 participants (male 67.5%, median age 73 years), 32.5% preferred an extremely passive attitude, while 61.4% reported that they actually chose an extremely passive attitude. A sole determinant of choosing an extremely passive decision-making role was lower educational status (odds ratio: 2.11, 95% confidence interval 1.11-4.00). The most important factor underlying the decision-making was ""Physician recommendation"" (89.2%). Notably, less than 50% considered ""In alignment with my values and preferences"" as an important factor underlying treatment decision-making. The majority of HF patients reported that they chose an extremely passive approach, and patients prioritized physician recommendation over their own values and preferences.",0
Patient preferences for physical therapy programs after a lower extremity fracture: a discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify patients' preferences for physical therapy programmes after a lower extremity fracture and determine patient factors associated with preference variation. DESIGN: Discrete choice experiment. SETTING: Level I trauma centre. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty-one adult (≥18 years old) patients with lower extremity fractures treated operatively. INTERVENTION: Patients were given hypothetical scenarios and asked to select their preferred therapy course when comparing cost, mobility, long-term pain, session duration, and treatment setting. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A multinomial logit model was used to determine the relative importance and willingness to pay for each attribute. RESULTS: Mobility was of greatest relative importance (45%, 95% CI: 40% to 49%), more than cost (23%, 95% CI: 19% to 27%), long-term pain (19%, 95% CI: 16% to 23%), therapy session duration (12%, 95% CI: 9% to 5%) or setting (1%, 95% CI: 0.2% to 2%). Patients were willing to pay US$142 more per session to return to their preinjury mobility level (95% CI: US$103 to US$182). Willingness to pay for improved mobility was higher for women, patients aged 70 years and older, those with bachelor's degrees or higher and those living in less-deprived areas. Patients were willing to pay US$72 (95% CI: US$50 to US$93) more per session to reduce pain from severe to mild. Patients were indifferent between formal and independent home therapy (willingness to pay: -US$12, 95% CI: -US$33 to US$9). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lower extremity fractures highly value recovering mobility and are willing to pay more for postoperative physical therapy programmes that facilitate returning to their pre-injury mobility level. These patient preferences might be useful when prescribing and designing new techniques for postoperative therapy.",1
Effectiveness of exercise interventions to improve long-term outcomes in people living with mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Although exercise guidelines now recommend exercise for patients with MCI, the long-term effects of exercise in patients with MCI has not been reviewed systematically. The aim was to assess (1) the effectiveness of exercise and physical activity (EXPA) interventions in improving long-term patient-relevant cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes in people with mild cognitive impairment, (2) how well the included trials reported details of the intervention, and (3) the extent to which reported endpoints were in line with patient preferences that were assessed in patient workshops. Following PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis including randomized controlled trials. A total of ten studies were included after searching in six electronic sources from 1995 onwards. There is a trend that 6 + -month EXPA interventions improve global cognition 12 months after initiation. Evidence on long-term effects of EXPA interventions on non-cognitive health outcomes could not be meaningfully pooled and the individual studies reported mixed results. Workshop participants considered freedom from pain and stress, mood, motivation and self-efficacy to be important, but these outcomes were rarely addressed. Too little information is available on intervention details for EXPA programs to be replicated and confidently recommended for patients with MCI.

Understanding Patient Perspectives Regarding Remote Monitoring Devices Following Total Joint Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Advances in smart technology have expanded into the field of orthopedic surgery to deliver enhanced patient care. Smart technology has also raised important issues regarding protected patient information. The purpose of this study is to determine patient preferences regarding smart technology in their postarthroplasty care. METHODS: Patient surveys were administered in the office setting of 2 adult reconstructive orthopedic surgeons during a 4-week period. Surveys queried patient demographics, twelve yes/no questions, five continuous agree/disagree statements, and a single free-text question. Logistic regression and statistical significance testing were performed. RESULTS: Of the study patients, 83.6% were willing to wear a device. Women were more likely to consent to a monitoring device and have activity data collected than men (P < .05). Younger patients were more likely to consent to a device and have data collected than octogenarians. Nearly 90% of respondents indicated peace of mind with data being constantly tracked. However, 64% of respondents had hesitations about a surgically implanted device that was independent of a previous arthroplasty surgery (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients are comfortable with smart technology being involved in their postoperative care, especially younger patients and women. Older individuals, possibly with less experience using smart technology in their lives, were not as willing to wear smart devices or have their data collected. Nearly two-thirds of patients had hesitations about surgically implanted smart devices. Further investigation is needed to understand hesitations concerning smart implants as the orthopedic community enters an era of commercially available smart implants in total joint arthroplasty.",0
An innovative approach to recruiting participants for dementia research: primary care and researcher perspectives.,"Aim: To describe clinician and researcher perceptions of a new, patient preference focused approach to recruiting patients for research from primary care-based memory clinics. Methods: Memory clinic clinicians completed a survey and key informants completed an individual interview to gather their perceptions of this new program. Results: The majority of clinicians were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with this recruitment approach and indicated that this approach would have minimal negative impact on patient care or create conflict of interest. Key informants valued the program for its patient-centred approach, the integration of research into care and potential for increased recruitment. Discussion: These findings are suggestive of support for this recruitment approach. Pilot testing will inform feasibility, effectiveness and process improvements.",0
"General-practitioner-led alcohol and other drugs withdrawal: Supporting patient choice, safety and success.","BACKGROUND: Alcohol or other drug (AOD) withdrawal is a common reason for patients to seek treatment. Ambulatory, or 'home-based', AOD withdrawal for patients who are low risk is a useful intervention for general practitioners (GPs) to help empower their patients to improve their health and make meaningful change to their AOD use. OBJECTIVE: This article explores the themes of patient choice, safety and optimising success in GP-led withdrawal. The four-step framework of 'who', 'prepare', 'withdrawal' and 'follow-up' outlines how to best support patients in the general practice setting to undertake a withdrawal. DISCUSSION: There are many benefits to a GP-led, home-based AOD withdrawal. The strategies to facilitate choice and safety and to optimise withdrawal success described in the article include careful patient selection, preparing the patient using domains of whole-person care, clarifying the patient's goals and stage of change, support during withdrawal and fostering long-term treatment in general practice.",0
Nongovernmental organizations supporting the HIV service delivery response in Africa - an engine for innovation.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are pivotal to the HIV response, supporting access to HIV services since the start of the epidemic. Against the backdrop of the impact of NGOs, is the recognition of the unique role that local NGOs bring to the HIV response, drawing from their deep understanding of the context and knowledge of local health problems. RECENT FINDINGS: The Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ) is one such NGO. Through various implementation science research and programs, CIDRZ has supported the Zambian government's HIV response. As Zambia moves closer to epidemic control, understanding reasons for patient disengagement from care and patient preferences for HIV care demonstrated by CIDRZ have contributed to global and national HIV treatment and care guidelines. SUMMARY: This paper offers a case study for how NGOs like CIDRZ can serve as health system-wide catalyst to identify, integrate, and scale up evidence-based practices for HIV prevention, care, and treatment. It draws from the public health literature, CIDRZ extensive program and research experience and implementation science theory, to illustrate key strategies that can be deployed by local NGOs to spark innovation, quality improvement, and support governments to achieve and sustain HIV epidemic control.",0
Management of mixed urinary incontinence: IUGA committee opinion.,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) is defined by the International Urogynecology Association (IUGA) and International Continence Society as the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine associated with urgency and also with exertion, effort, sneezing or coughing. It therefore implies the coexistence of both stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). MUI is a heterogeneous diagnosis that requires an assessment of its individual components of SUI and UUI. Management requires an individualised approach to the symptom components. The aim of this review is to identify the assessment/investigations and management options for MUI. METHODS: A working subcommittee from the IUGA Research & Development (R&D) Committee was created and volunteers invited from the IUGA membership. A literature review was performed to provide guidance focused on the recommended assessment and management of MUI. The document was then evaluated by the entire IUGA R&D Committee and IUGA Board of Directors and revisions made. The final document represents the IUGA R&D Committee Opinion. RESULTS: The R&D Committee MUI opinion paper provides guidance on the assessment and management of women with MUI and summarises the evidence-based recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Mixed urinary incontinence is a complex problem and successful management requires alleviation of both the stress and urge components. Care should be individualised based on patient preferences. Further research is needed to guide patients in setting goals and to determine which component of MUI to treat first. The evidence for many of the surgical/procedural treatment options for MUI are limited and needs to be explored in more detail.",0
Patient experiences of undergoing abortion with and without an ultrasound scan in Britain.,"BACKGROUND: Routine ultrasound scanning to determine gestational age and pregnancy location has long been part of pre-abortion assessment in Britain, despite not being legally required or recommended in national clinical guidelines. To support implementation of fully telemedical abortion care (implemented in Britain in April 2020), the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) issued clinical guidance for an 'as-indicated' approach to pre-abortion ultrasound, removing the need for a clinic visit. We aimed to understand patient experiences of ultrasound in abortion care by conducting a qualitative study with individuals who had abortions with and without an ultrasound scan. METHODS: Between November 2021 and July 2022, we recruited patients who had a medical abortion at home without a pre-procedure ultrasound at 69 days' gestation or less at British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), and also had at least one other abortion with an ultrasound from any provider in Britain. We conducted interviews using a semi-structured interview guide to explore our participants' experiences and conducted reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: We recruited 24 participants and included 19 interviews in our analysis. We developed three themes from our data. These were 'Ultrasound scans and their relationship with autonomy and decision-making', 'Intrusive and out of place: the ultrasound as an inappropriate technology' and 'Towards preference-centred, quality care'. CONCLUSIONS: Further research and user-testing of strategies to improve the scan experience should be undertaken. Patient testimonies on the negative impact of ultrasound scans in abortion care should reassure providers that omitting them according to patient preference is a positive step towards providing patient-centred care.",0
ANALYSIS THE RESULTS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT AND EARLY REHABILITATION OF PATIENTS WITH MASSIVE TEARS THE ROTATOR CUFF THE SHOULDER.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the treatment outcomes in patients who underwent arthroscopic repair of large and massive rotator cuff tears and underwent rehabilitation at different stages of the recovery process. The clinical study group consisted of 88 patients, with an age range of 47 to 68 years (mean age 52,7±9,5 years). All patients underwent a double-row repair of the rotator cuff tendons and tenodesis or tenotomy of the long head of the biceps tendon under arthroscopic guidance. The results were assessed using the Constant Shoulder Score and the Oxford Shoulder Score scales at 6 and 12 months after the surgery. A total of 88 patients were selected, with 50 patients in the main group (MG) who had a 6-week immobilization period. The control group (CG) consisted of 38 patients who had a shortened immobilization period of 3-4 weeks due to patient preference or recommendations from other rehabilitation centers where patients underwent rehabilitation. Shoulder immobilization was performed using a standard sling with a triangular pillow and a 15° abduction angle in the shoulder joint. Following the surgeon's recommendation, all patients were offered a rehabilitation program consisting of three periods: immobilization (0-6 weeks), functional (6-12 weeks), and training (>12 weeks) periods. Comparative analysis of the treatment results using the Oxford Shoulder Score scale showed that significantly better results were obtained in the MG patients (41,5±2,1 points) compared to the CG patients (34,2±3,6 points) at 6,2±1,2 months (p˂0.05). Comparative analysis of the treatment results using the Oxford Shoulder Score scale at 12,2±1,3 months showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the MG and CG results (MG - 44,5±2,2 and CG - 42,4±3, p>0,05). Similarly, according to the Constant Shoulder Score scale, better results were observed in the MG both at 6 months and 12 months after the surgery (excellent in 82% of MG vs 36.8% in CG, good in 18% of MG vs 57.9% in CG, respectively). Thus, in the short term, early activation of the operated joint leads to delayed healing of the operated tissues and worsening of joint function, as confirmed by the comparative analysis of the examined groups. Significant advantages of prolonged immobilization (at least 6 weeks) were found in short-term observation (up to 6 months), and no differences in functional outcomes were observed in the long term during the follow-up at 12 months.",0
Statement of the Spanish Interdisciplinary Vascular Prevention Committee on the updated European Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention.,"We present the Spanish adaptation of the 2021 European Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) prevention in clinical practice. The current guidelines besides the individual approach greatly emphasize on the importance of population level approaches to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Systematic global CVD risk assessment is recommended in individuals with any major vascular risk factor. Regarding LDL-Cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus, goals and targets remain as recommended in previous guidelines. However, it is proposed a new, stepwise approach (Step 1 and 2) to treatment intensification as a tool to help physicians and patients pursue these targets in a way that fits patient profile. After Step 1, considering proceeding to the intensified goals of Step 2 is mandatory, and this intensification will be based on 10-year CVD risk, lifetime CVD risk and treatment benefit, comorbidities and patient preferences. The updated SCORE algorithm-SCORE2, SCORE-OP- is recommended in these guidelines, which estimates an individual's 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke) in healthy men and women aged 40-89 years. Another new and important recommendation is the use of different categories of risk according different age groups (< 50, 50-69, ≥70 years). Different flow charts of CVD risk and risk factor treatment in apparently healthy persons, in patients with established atherosclerotic CVD, and in diabetic patients are recommended. Patients with chronic kidney disease are considered high risk or very high-risk patients according to the levels of glomerular filtration rate and albumin-to-creatinine ratio. New lifestyle recommendations adapted to the ones published by the Spanish Ministry of Health as well as recommendations focused on the management of lipids, blood pressure, diabetes and chronic renal failure are included.",0
"Discrete-Choice Experiment to Understand the Preferences of Patients with Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer in the USA, Canada, and the UK.","BACKGROUND: Treatment options for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) have broadened, and treatment decisions can have a long-lasting impact on patients' quality of life. Data on patient preferences can improve therapeutic decision-making by helping physicians suggest treatments that align with patients' values and needs. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to quantify patient preferences for attributes of chemohormonal therapies among patients with mHSPC in the USA, Canada, and the UK. METHODS: A discrete-choice experiment survey instrument was developed and administered to patients with high- and very-high-risk localized prostate cancer and mHSPC. Patients chose between baseline androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) alone and experimentally designed, hypothetical treatment alternatives representing chemohormonal therapies. Choices were analyzed using logit models to derive the relative importance of attributes for each country and to evaluate differences and similarities among patients across countries. RESULTS: A total of 550 respondents completed the survey (USA, 200; Canada, 200; UK, 150); the mean age of respondents was 64.3 years. Treatment choices revealed that patients were most concerned with treatment efficacy. However, treatment-related convenience factors, such as route of drug administration and frequency of monitoring visits, were as important as some treatment-related side effects, such as skin rash, nausea, and fatigue. Patient preferences across countries were similar, although patients in Canada appeared to be more affected by concomitant steroid use. CONCLUSION: Patients with mHSPC believe the use of ADT alone is insufficient when more effective treatments are available. Efficacy is the most significant driver of patient choices. Treatment-related convenience factors can be as important as safety concerns for patients.",1
Great expectations: patients' preferences for clinically significant results from genomic sequencing.,"We aimed to describe patient preferences for a broad range of secondary findings (SF) from genomic sequencing (GS) and factors driving preferences. We assessed preference data within a trial of the Genomics ADvISER, (SF decision aid) among adult cancer patients. Participants could choose from five categories of SF: (1) medically actionable; (2) polygenic risks; (3) rare diseases; (4) early-onset neurological diseases; and (5) carrier status. We analyzed preferences using descriptive statistics and drivers of preferences using multivariable logistic regression models. The 133 participants were predominantly European (74%) or East Asian or mixed ancestry (13%), female (90%), and aged > 50 years old (60%). The majority chose to receive SF. 97% (129/133) chose actionable findings with 36% (48/133) choosing all 5 categories. Despite the lack of medical actionability, participants were interested in receiving SF of polygenic risks (74%), carrier status (75%), rare diseases (59%), and early-onset neurologic diseases (53%). Older participants were more likely to be interested in receiving results for early-onset neurological diseases, while those exhibiting lower decisional conflict were more likely to select all categories. Our results highlight a disconnect between cancer patient preferences and professional guidelines on SF, such as ACMG's recommendations to only return medically actionable secondary findings. In addition to clinical evidence, future guidelines should incorporate patient preferences.",0
Treatment Preferences in Young Adults with Moderate to Severe Psoriasis: A Qualitative Study from the Nordic Countries.,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to explore treatment preferences and identify patient characteristics in young bio-naive adults with moderate to severe psoriasis in the Nordic countries (Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Denmark). METHODS: Patients were 18-45 years old and bio-naive but referred for biologic treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. Patients were included at eight Nordic dermatology clinics. Patients with significant comorbidity or psoriatic arthritis were excluded. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) were assessed along with basic patient information. A semistructured interview guide was used in individual qualitative interviews, asking patients about their treatment preferences and reasons, disease journey, and disease management. The interviews were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Twenty-four patients sufficed to reach saturation in this qualitative study. RESULTS: The patient sample characteristics represented a qualitative variation in age, sex, symptoms, duration of disease, and country. We included a total of 12 male and 12 female patients. The mean age was 34 years (range 18-45 years), the mean age at diagnosis was 20 years (range 6-34 years), the mean ± standard deviation (SD) time since diagnosis was 13 ± 8 years, PASI was 9.5 ± 4.7, and DLQI was 15.2 ± 6.4. Interviews suggested that both the burden of disease as well as the burden of treatment influenced patient preferences regarding treatment attributes, hence getting alleviation from symptoms did not alone influence patient preferences. Time, effort, and inconvenience related to psoriasis treatments also influenced patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: This first in-depth, qualitative study in young bio-naive adults with psoriasis suggests that patient preferences are focusing not only on symptom relief but also on alleviating the burden of psoriasis treatment. Understanding the reasons for patient preferences and the perspectives of young adults is needed to guide individual shared decision-making in psoriasis management.",1
[Analysis of the experience and procedural complications of trans-radial access versus trans-femoral access for hepatic arterial perfusion chemotherapy in patients with advanced hepatic malignancies:a retrospective study].,"Objective: To analyze the differences between trans-radial access (TRA) and trans-femoral access (TFA) in hepatic arterial perfusion chemotherapy (HAIC) in terms of patient experience, postoperative complications, and patient preferences; explore whether TRA in HAIC is associated with better patient experience and compliance; and determine whether it is safer than TFA. Methods: The study was a retrospective cohort study of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastases from colorectal cancer treated with HAIC. We enrolled a total of 91 patients with advanced liver malignancies treated with HAIC from November 2022 to May 2023 in the Department of Interventional Therapy and Hepatobiliary Medicine at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital. The patients were divided into three groups: group TRA (n=20, receiving TRA HAIC only), group TFA (n=33, receiving TFA HAIC only), and crossover group [n=19, receiving TFA HAIC (Cross-TFA group) first, followed by TRA HAIC (Cross-TRA group)]. Meanwhile, to facilitate the expression of partial results, all patients receiving TRA HAIC were defined as the TRA-HAIC group (n=39, TRA+Cross-TRA group), and all patients receiving TFA HAIC were defined as the TFA-HAIC group (n=52, TFA+Cross-TFA group). The primary research index was the Quality of Life (QOL) visualization scale score. The secondary research index included approach-related and catheter-related adverse events, duration of surgery, and mean length of patient stay. We used various statistical methods such as Mann-Whitney U test, t-test, Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, univariate logistic regression analysis, and multi-factor analysis. Results: TRA patients had significantly lower QOL scores than TFA patients (all P<0.001). The QOL scores of the Cross-TRA group were significantly lower than those of the Cross-TFA group (pain at the puncture site Z=-3.24, P=0.001, others P<0.001). The QOL scores of the Cross-TRA group were compared with those of the TRA group, which showed that the scores of the Cross-TRA group in overall discomfort (Z=-3.07,P=0.002), postoperative toilet difficulty (Z=-2.12, P=0.034), and walking difficulty (Z=-2.58, P=0.010) were significantly lower than those of the TRA group. Satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the Cross-TRA group than in the Cross-TFA group (Z=-3.78, P<0.001), and patients were more likely to receive TRA HAIC as the next procedure (χ(2)=30.42, P<0.001). In terms of mean length of stay, patients receiving TRA HAIC had a significantly lower mean length of stay than those receiving TFA HAIC (50.1±3.2 h vs. 58.4±6.4 h, t=7.98, P<0.001). The incidence of radial artery occlusion (RAO) as an approach-related adverse event was 15.4% (6/39) in the TRA-HAIC group, which was significantly higher than that in the TFA-HAIC group (15.4% vs. 0, χ(2)=8.56, P=0.005). Notably, multifactorial analysis of RAO-related factors showed that intraoperative enoxaparin use and patency of radial artery flow during pressure were significantly associated with a reduced risk of postoperative RAO (P=0.037 for enoxaparin use and P=0.049 for pressure). Conclusions: With respect to procedure approach, TRA was significantly better than TFA in terms of patient satisfaction and mean length of stay. Through further process optimization and prevention of adverse reactions, the incidence of adverse reactions can be maintained at a relatively low level, so that patients can benefit from TRA in future operations in terms of cost-effectiveness and medical efficiency.",0

Technological advancements, including omics data integration, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics, shape the future of personalized medicinal therapy. These tools enable precise pharmacogenomic selection of medications and the development of integrated risk-scoring systems. Patient engagement and education are also central, with empowered patients and remote monitoring contributing to collaborative decision-making. In conclusion, the narrative review underscores that personalized medicinal therapy post stent implantation holds immense promise for revolutionizing cardiovascular care. By embracing a comprehensive approach that considers genetics, clinical factors, and patient preferences, healthcare providers can optimize treatment outcomes and improve patient quality of life. The evolving landscape of personalized medicine offers a glimpse into a future where tailored treatment strategies become the cornerstone of precision cardiovascular care.",0
Current status and prospect for future advancements of long-acting antibody formulations.,"INTRODUCTION: Biologics, especially monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), have become a major class of therapeutics in recent years addressing the needs of millions of patients and becoming one of the best-selling treatments in the pharmaceutical market. A wide range of multifaceted chronic diseases have benefitted from antibody therapeutics. Long-term treatment for chronic diseases with mAb therapies can mean a lifetime of frequent injections. Technologies that can minimize the total number of injections present meaningful value to patients and the companies that develop them. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the challenges encountered during the development of long-acting versions of mAbs. The focus will be on questions addressed during drug product development, delivery device selection, business implications, and understanding the market potential of long-acting presentations. EXPERT OPINION: Long-acting drug delivery systems have reached the market for small molecules and peptides. However, these drug delivery systems, and their development lessons, cannot be extrapolated directly to antibodies. We must develop new delivery technologies suitable for biologics, identify critical attributes to capture dynamic changes in proteins during the encapsulation process, and develop analytical processes to evaluate long-term stability.",0
Primary prevention of cancer-associated venous thrombosis: Rationale and challenges in clinical practice.,"Cancer-associated venous thrombosis (CAT) is a common, multifactor event known to complicate the course of cancer and jeopardize a patient's prognosis. The current guidelines regarding the prevention of CAT are sometimes considered insufficiently precise about specific situations, or are poorly applied. The expected benefits of thromboprophylaxis are balanced by the risk of major bleeding induced by anticoagulation, which implies a need to accurately identify ambulatory patients at high risk of thrombosis or hemorrhage. The Khorana score is commonly used for this, but is limited by the non-reproducibility of predicted performance across cancer types, and by the fact that antitumor treatment and cardiovascular risks are not included. The COMPASS-CAT score, which includes those two aspects, was found to be a more accurate predictor of venous thromboembolism in patients with lung cancer, and to better distinguish between patients at low or high risk of thrombosis. The frailty of patients with cancer is also a major issue, and should be taken into account when thromboprophylaxis is considered. According to current guidelines, CAT prophylaxis should be considered for hospitalized patients, those for whom surgery is scheduled, or those with pancreatic cancers. In ambulatory patients, decisions should be made according to patient, cancer and antitumoral treatment characteristics. Low molecular weight heparin is the gold standard of CAT prophylaxis. Despite increased risks of bleeding or drug-drug interactions in cancer patients, direct oral anticoagulants could be alternate options for high-risk ambulatory patients that should be accompanied by a careful global analysis of benefits, harms, and patient preferences.",0
Comparison of a validated decision-support tool to a standard of care triage system for knee osteoarthritis assessment: a proof-of-concept study.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) in northwestern Ontario are referred by their primary care provider (PCP) to a centralized assessment clinic for evaluation by an advanced practice physiotherapist (APP) to determine if they will require surgical management. However, many patients are found to not require surgical management, resulting in delays for patients who do. A decision-support tool was developed to address this issue and to guide treatment options by determining the need for surgical or nonsurgical approaches. METHODS: We used a proof-of-concept method to assess the use of the decision-support tool in northwestern Ontario. Data from 100 consecutive patients assessed for knee OA management were collected from the Thunder Bay centralized assessment clinic. Two levels of agreement analyses (calculated using Cohen κ statistic) were performed, between the APP assessment decision (surgical or non-surgical) and the decision-support tool recommendation, and between the surgeon's decision (surgical or non-surgical) and the decision-support tool recommendation. RESULTS: We found a near-perfect agreement (κ = 0.870, n = 65) between the APP decision and the decision-support tool recommendation, when controlled for patient preference. There was a substantial level of agreement (κ = 0.618, n = 72) between the decision-support tool recommendation and the surgeon's decision. CONCLUSION: The decision-support tool recommendation showed considerable agreement with the decisions of the APP and surgeon indicating that it could be a valuable tool to guide PCPs caring for patients with knee OA. The applicability of a decision-support tool in northwestern Ontario displayed promising results, but further research is needed to examine the feasibility in a primary care setting.",0
Scar Ectopic Pregnancy as an Uncommon Site of Ectopic Pregnancy: A Case Report and Literature Review.,"A cesarean scar pregnancy is a rare type of ectopic pregnancy that occurs when a fertilized egg implants in the scar from a previous cesarean section. It is a serious condition that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality if not managed promptly and appropriately. In this literature review and case report, we discuss the etiology, diagnosis, and management of cesarean scar pregnancy. We conducted a comprehensive search of relevant literature using electronic databases and included studies that reported on the diagnosis and management of cesarean scar pregnancy. We also present a case report of a patient with cesarean scar pregnancy who was managed surgically. The diagnosis of cesarean scar pregnancy is primarily done via transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound, and medical or surgical management can be used depending on the gestational age, hemodynamic status, and patient preferences. The surgical approach, which involves hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, or laparotomy, is usually preferred, since it is associated with fast recovery and lower recurrence rates. However, it is crucial to consider the patient's plans for future fertility when selecting the management approach. In conclusion, cesarean scar pregnancy is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt and appropriate management. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent significant morbidity and mortality, and surgical management is usually preferred due to its higher success rates and lower recurrence rates.",0
Group sequential two-stage preference designs.,"The two-stage preference design (TSPD) enables inference for treatment efficacy while allowing for incorporation of patient preference to treatment. It can provide unbiased estimates for selection and preference effects, where a selection effect occurs when patients who prefer one treatment respond differently than those who prefer another, and a preference effect is the difference in response caused by an interaction between the patient's preference and the actual treatment they receive. One potential barrier to adopting TSPD in practice, however, is the relatively large sample size required to estimate selection and preference effects with sufficient power. To address this concern, we propose a group sequential two-stage preference design (GS-TSPD), which combines TSPD with sequential monitoring for early stopping. In the GS-TSPD, pre-planned sequential monitoring allows investigators to conduct repeated hypothesis tests on accumulated data prior to full enrollment to assess study eligibility for early trial termination without inflating type I error rates. Thus, the procedure allows investigators to terminate the study when there is sufficient evidence of treatment, selection, or preference effects during an interim analysis, thereby reducing the design resource in expectation. To formalize such a procedure, we verify the independent increments assumption for testing the selection and preference effects and apply group sequential stopping boundaries from the approximate sequential density functions. Simulations are then conducted to investigate the operating characteristics of our proposed GS-TSPD compared to the traditional TSPD. We demonstrate the applicability of the design using a study of Hepatitis C treatment modality.",0
"Access to device-aided therapies in advanced Parkinson's disease: navigating clinician biases, patient preference, and prognostic uncertainty.","Device-aided therapies (DAT), which include deep brain stimulation and pump-based continuous dopaminergic stimulation with either levodopa or apomorphine, are among the major advances in the clinical management of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although DAT are being increasingly offered earlier in the disease course, their classical indication remains advanced PD. Theoretically, every patient should be offered transition to DAT when faced with refractory motor and nonmotor fluctuations and functional decline. Worldwide clinical reality is far from these ideal, and, therefore, question the ""real-world"" equal opportunity of access to DAT for PD patients with advanced PD-even within a single health care system. Differences in access to care, referral pattern (timing and frequency), as well as physician biases (unconscious/implicit or conscious/explicit bias), and patients' preferences or health-seeking behaviour are to be considered. Compared to DBS, little information is available concerning infusion therapies, as well as neurologists' and patients' attitudes towards them. This viewpoint aims to be thought-provoking and to assist clinicians in moving through the process of DAT selection, by including in their decision algorithm their own biases, patient perspective, ethical concerns as well as the current unknowns surrounding PD prognosis and DAT-related long-term side effects for a given patient.",0
Patient Preferences for Adjuvant Treatment in Muscle-Invasive Urothelial Carcinoma: A Multi-Country Discrete Choice Experiment.,"PURPOSE: The evolving treatment landscape in muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma creates challenges for clinicians and patients in selecting the most appropriate therapy. Here, we aimed to understand adjuvant treatment preferences among patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma who underwent radical resection, including tradeoffs between efficacy outcomes and toxicity risks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional study utilizing a discrete choice experiment was conducted across the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Germany via a web-based survey. Patients ≥18 years of age who self-reported as having been diagnosed with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma were included. Patients indicated their preferences between hypothetical treatment profiles varying in eight attributes relating to efficacy, regimen, and side effects. Preference weights were estimated using hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression; relative attribute importance estimates were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, 207 patients were included (age ≥56 years, 65.7%; male, 54.1%). Patients chose adjuvant treatment 91.2% of the time vs no treatment. Prolonging overall survival from 25 to 78 months was most important, followed by reducing serious side effect risks. Increasing disease-free survival from 12 to 24 months was more important than decreasing risks of fatigue from 54% to 15% and nausea from 53% to 7%. Treatment with the shortest dosing regimen was more important for patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy; prolonging overall survival was more important than reducing the risk of a serious side effect in non-US patients; the opposite was found in the United States. CONCLUSION: Patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma who underwent radical resection preferred adjuvant treatment over no treatment regardless of side effects. Patients prioritized overall survival improvements followed by a reduced side effect profile.",1
Effects of decision aids on breast reconstruction: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate the effects of decision aids for women facing breast reconstruction decision on decision conflict, decision regret, knowledge, satisfaction, anxiety and depression. BACKGROUND: Breast reconstruction decision is not good or bad and should be guided by clinical evidence and patient preferences. Decision aids can increase the patient's decision-making enthusiasm and ability, improve the quality of decision and promote shared decision-making between patients and medical staff. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Eight databases were conducted from the establishment of the database until October 2021. The PRISMA checklist was selected for analysis in this paper. The meta-analysis was conducted in Review Manager 5.3. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The result is decision conflict, decision regret, knowledge and other secondary outcomes. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were also conducted. RESULTS: A total of twelve randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed that decision aids could significantly reduce decision conflict and decision regret, improve knowledge, satisfaction and depression and had no influence on anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the systematic review and meta-analysis reviewed the positive effect of decision aids on the decision-making of women facing postmastectomy breast reconstruction. In the future, more well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm the effects of decision aids on the decision-making of breast reconstruction and nurses should be encouraged to take part in the development of decision aids in accordance with strict standards and apply them to breast cancer patients considering postmastectomy breast reconstruction. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Our study provides evidence for the effectiveness of decision aids on breast reconstruction and points to the important role of healthcare providers in the use of decision aids and in facilitating shared decision-making.",0
Fix or Replace? Patient Preferences for the Treatment of Geriatric Lower Extremity Fractures: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: When considering treatment options for geriatric patients with lower extremity fractures, little is known about which outcomes are prioritized by patients. This study aimed to determine the patient preferences for outcomes after a geriatric lower extremity fracture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We administered a discrete choice experiment survey to 150 patients who were at least 60 years of age and treated for a lower extremity fracture at a Level I trauma center. The discrete choice experiment presented study participants with 8 sets of hypothetical outcome comparisons, including joint preservation (yes or no), risk of reoperation at 6 months and 24 months, postoperative weightbearing status, disposition, and function as measured by return to baseline walking distance. We estimated the relative importance of these potential outcomes using multinomial logit modeling. RESULTS: The strongest patient preference was for maintained function after treatment (59%, P < .001), followed by reoperation within 6 months (12%, P < .001). Although patients generally favored joint preservation, patients were willing to change their preference in favor of joint replacement if it increased function (walking distance) by 13% (SE, 66%). Reducing the short-term reoperation risk (12%, P < .001) was more important to patients than reducing long-term reoperation risk (4%, P = .33). Disposition and weightbearing status were lesser priorities to patients (9%, P < .001 and 7%, P < .001, respectively). DISCUSSION: After a lower extremity fracture, geriatric patients prioritized maintained walking function. Avoiding short-term reoperation was more important than avoiding long-term reoperation. Joint preservation through fracture fixation was the preferred treatment of geriatric patients unless arthroplasty or arthrodesis provides a meaningful functional benefit. Hospital disposition and postoperative weightbearing status were less important to patients than the other included outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric patients strongly prioritize function over other outcomes after a lower extremity fracture.",1
"Treatment preferences of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France, and Spain: results from a discrete choice experiment.","INTRODUCTION: Newer treatment options for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) with efficacy and safety profiles that differ from traditional therapies have facilitated personalized management strategies to optimize patient outcomes. In the context of such personalized management, understanding how treatment characteristics influence patients' preferences is essential. This study assessed patients' preferences for RRMM treatment attributes and determined trade-offs between potential benefits, administration procedures, and adverse effects. METHODS: Patients' preferences were evaluated using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Patients with RRMM who reported failing two lines of anti-myeloma treatment (immunomodulatory agent and a proteasome inhibitor [PI]) or ≥ 3 lines (including ≥1 PI, immunomodulatory agent, or anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody), were recruited across the US, UK, Italy, Germany, France, and Spain. DCE attributes and levels were identified using a targeted literature review, a review of clinical data for relevant RRMM treatments, qualitative patient interviews, and input from clinical and myeloma patient experts. The DCE was administered within an online survey from February-June 2022. Preference data were analyzed using an error-component logit model and willingness to make trade-offs for potential benefits, and relative attribute importance scores were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, 296 patients from the US (n = 100), UK (n = 49), Italy (n = 45), Germany (n = 43), France (n = 39), and Spain (n = 20) participated in the DCE. Mean (standard deviation) age was 63.8 (8.0) years, 84% had a caregiver, and patients had a median of 3 (range: 2-8) prior lines of therapy. Efficacy attributes most influenced patients' preferences, with increasing overall response rate (25-85%) and overall survival (6 months to 2 years) contributing to ~50% of treatment decision-making. Administration procedures were also considered important to patients. Avoiding individual side effects was considered relatively less important, with patients willing to tolerate increases in side effects for gains in efficacy. Patient characteristics such as rate of disease progression, sociodemographics, or clinical characteristics also influenced treatment preferences. CONCLUSION: Patients with RRMM were willing to tolerate increased risk of side effects for higher efficacy. Preferences and risk tolerance varied between patients, with preference patterns differing by certain patient characteristics. This highlights the importance of shared decision-making for optimal treatment selection and patient outcomes.",1
Eliciting preferences for cancer screening tests: Comparison of a discrete choice experiment and the threshold technique.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare results of three preference elicitation methods for a cancer screening test. METHODS: Participants (undergraduate students) completed a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and a threshold technique (TT) task. Accuracy (false positives, false negatives), benefits (lives saved), and cost for a cancer screening test were used as attributes in the DCE and branching logic for the TT. Participants were also asked a direct elicitation question regarding a hypothetical screening test for breast (women) or prostate (men) cancer without mortality benefit. Correlations assessed the relationship between DCE and TT thresholds. Thresholds were standardized and ranked for both methods to compare. A logistic regression used the thresholds to predict results of the direct elicitation. RESULTS: DCE and TT estimates were not meaningfully correlated (max ρ = 0.17). Participant rankings of attributes matched only 20% of the time (58/292). Neither method predicted preference for being screened (ps > 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: The DCE and TT yielded different preference estimates (and rank orderings) for the same participant. Neither method predicted patients' desires for a screening test. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians, patients, policy makers, and researchers should be aware that patient preference results may be sensitive to the method of eliciting preferences.",1
Advances in Human-Centered Care to Address Contemporary Unmet Needs in Chronic Dialysis.,"Advances in the treatment of kidney failure with chronic dialysis have stagnated over the past three decades, with over 50% of patients still managed by conventional in-hospital haemodialysis. In parallel, the demands of chronic dialysis medical care have changed and evolved due to a growing population that has higher frailty and multimorbidity. Thus, the gap between the needs of kidney failure patients and the healthcare capability to provide effective overall management has widened. To address this problem, healthcare policy has increasingly aligned towards a human-centred approach. The paradigm shift of human-centred approach places patients at the forefront of decision-making processes, ensuring that specific needs are understood and prioritised. Integration of human-centred approaches with patient care has been shown to improve satisfaction and quality of life. The aim of this narrative is to evaluate the current clinical challenges for managing kidney failure for dialysis providers; summarise current experiences and unmet needs of chronic dialysis patients; and finally emphasise how human-centred care has advanced chronic dialysis care. Specific incremental advances include implementation of renal supportive care; home-assisted dialysis; hybrid dialysis; refinements to dialysis methods; whereas emerging advances include portable and wearable dialysis devices and the potential for the integration of artificial intelligence in clinical practice.",0
Real-World Experience of People with Hemophilia A Receiving Turoctocog Alfa Pegol (N8-GP): Results from a Patient Experience Survey.,"PURPOSE: Turoctocog alfa pegol (N8-GP) is an extended half-life recombinant factor VIII molecule used for the treatment of hemophilia A (HA). The purpose of this study was to investigate real-world experiences of patients with HA treated with N8-GP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 25-minute online survey was completed by adults (≥18 years) and caregivers of adolescents (12-16 years) with HA receiving N8-GP across six countries (Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, UK and US). Patients were recruited using a multichannel approach through recruitment panels, referrals from healthcare professionals and patient associations. The survey comprised a questionnaire with metrics including satisfaction and preferences for N8-GP, quality of life (QoL) and long-term impact. RESULTS: A total of 62 participants (98% male [n=61], mean age 29 years) comprising 46 patients and 16 caregivers completed the survey. Patients (60% non-severe [n=37] and 40% severe [25]) were on N8-GP for a mean period of 1.4 years. Patients expressed satisfaction (95% vs 42%, p<0.001) and preference (91% vs 9%, p<0.001) for N8-GP vs their previous treatments. Most patients with severe HA (87%, p=0.038) and patients on prophylaxis (84%, p<0.001) stated lower frequency of injections as their main reason for satisfaction, while improved QoL drove satisfaction for non-severe patients (81%, p=0.053). Overall, patients perceived that QoL score improved (74.8 vs 65.9, p=0.01) with N8-GP treatment compared with previous treatments. Flexibility to store at room temperature was one of the key convenience factors driving satisfaction. Patients believed that N8-GP can offer a long-term impact in areas such as ability to perform day-to-day activities (68%), independence to live like a person without hemophilia (63%), ability to travel (60%) with a feeling of optimism and hopefulness (82%). CONCLUSION: Lower frequency of injections, storage flexibility and improved QoL drove satisfaction and preference for N8-GP over previous treatments among patients with HA.",0
Considering patient perspectives in economic evaluations of health interventions.,"Current guidelines for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of health interventions commonly recommend the use of a payer and/or a societal perspective. This raises the concern that the resulting reimbursement decision may overlook the full spectrum of impacts and equity considerations. In this paper, we argue that a potential solution is to supplement a societal- or payer-perspective economic evaluation with an additional evaluation accounting for exclusively the patient perspective. We present five categories of health interventions for which a patient-perspective analysis may be informative including those (1) that cross the definitional boundary between drugs and non-drug technologies; (2) affect patient adherence to protocol; (3) represent revolutionary treatments for genetic disorders; (4) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio involving slightly less effective, but substantially less costly, than the current standard; and (5) have been previously approved for funding but now being targeted for potential delisting or disinvestment. Real-world examples are discussed in detail. Lived experience individuals were invited to provide vignettes. Discussions are provided regarding how to incorporate patient inputs to improve patient-centered decision-making.",0
Patient perspectives on teledentistry and face-to-face doctor interaction during orthodontic treatment.,"INTRODUCTION: Teledentistry in orthodontics is growing, yet patient preferences for its use is unknown. This study aimed to determine the perceived value of doctor-to-patient face-to-face interaction, convenience, and attitudes toward specific uses of teledentistry among orthodontic patients. METHODS: Private practice orthodontists emailed an electronic survey to active patients. Patients aged ≥18 years completed the survey regarding their treatment. Parents of patients aged <18 years completed a separate survey regarding their child's treatment. Responses were compared on the basis of patient characteristics (adult vs child, braces vs clear aligners, etc). RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-seven respondents from 8 orthodontic practices participated in the survey. Eighty-five percent of parents considered face-to-face interaction important, and 85% said that their child's treatment fit conveniently into their schedule. Adult responses were 86% and 89%, respectively. Adult preference for face-to-face was significantly higher than parents of adolescent patients (83% vs 78%; P = 0.038). Adults treated with clear aligners were less likely to strongly agree that their treatment fitted conveniently in their schedule (51% vs 76% in braces; P = 0.0490) and were more likely to be interested in using teledentistry (27% vs 18% in braces; P = 0.0429). CONCLUSIONS: Most orthodontic patients prefer to be seen face-to-face. This is due to the high value placed on face-to-face interaction with the orthodontist. Most patients do not consider their treatment inconvenient. Patients prefer that teledentistry be used to enhance communication as opposed to replacing face-to-face interaction. Implementing teledentistry in orthodontics should be applied on a patient-to-patient basis with continued emphasis on the doctor-patient relationship.",0
The importance of reminders and patient preferences to improve inhaler technique in older adults with COPD.,"Objectives: Medication non-adherence in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is common. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of two interventions to improve the inhalation technique (IT) in patients with pulmonary disease is common. Also determine optimal IT reminder time and to test the role of preferences in the intervention selection. Method: 726 pulmonary disease in common patients (consecutive sampling) from two trials: 1) TECEPOC-study (patients' preference trial/comprehensive cohort design) 2) TIEPOC-study (randomised controlled trial). Interventions: intervention-A (ad-hoc leaflet with instructions about correct IT according Spanish Respiratory Society), intervention B (intervention A+ individual training by instructors). Four visits were performed (baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months). Data on IT, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, quality of life and respiratory drugs were recorded. Analysis under intention to treat principle. Multivariate analysis was conducted to measure the potential modifying factors of improvement in the IT along follow-up. Results: 660 patients (90.9%) did not perform a correct IT at baseline 89.75% with Handihaler, 86.95% with Turbuhaler, 84.75% with Accuhaler and 87.35% with pMDI. At 12 months, 221 patients 29.9% performed correctly the IT; a decrease in the slope of the curve (correct IT) was detected at 3 months follow-up. Intervention B was the most effective in both trials compared to control group or intervention A, regardless of preferences: 1) TECEPOC Study (preference trial): Intervention B versus control group, NNT = 3.22 (IC95%, 2.27-5.52); and versus Intervention A, NNT = 3.57 (CI95%, 2.41-6.8). Preferences improved 6.7% in the correct IT without statistical significance. 2) TIEPOC Study (randomized controlled trial): Intervention B versus control group, NNT = 1.74 (IC95%, 1.47-2.17), and versus intervention A, NNT = 3.33 (CI 95%, 2.43-5.55). No differences were measured between Intervention A and control group. Conclusion: Individual training significantly improves IT. Reminders every 3 months are recommended. Preferences do not influence the intervention effectiveness.",0

[Participation of Patients in the Development of Clinical Guidelines: A Selective Country Comparison in a Narrative Review].,"AIM: A clinical practice guideline aims to optimize patient care by recommending diagnostic or treatment pathways, based on the best available research and practical experience. Therefore, the needs and preferences of patients and their families should be incorporated. The aim of this study was to examine regulations and standards of patient involvement in guideline development, using a selective comparison of countries. METHOD: Information was extracted from publicly available websites and guidelines development manuals for the United Kingdom (UK), the United States, Canada, and Australia. They were compared and discussed in a narrative review. RESULTS: In the UK, at least two people from among patients or the public must be involved in all guideline development committees and during all stages of the development process. The US National Academy of Medicine recommends active participation in guideline development groups by patients with disease-specific experience and patient representatives from the public. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care wants patient preferences to be involved, especially in the development of final guideline recommendations and usability testing. In Australia, guidelines receive the approval or seal of approval of the National Health and Medical Research Council if at least one patient representative can be shown to have been a member of the committee and to have been involved in the entire process of guideline development. CONCLUSION: The selective country comparison shows that patient involvement in guideline development and the binding nature of the rules vary considerably, and that there are no uniform standards for involvement. Many issues of involvement are unresolved, and special sensitivity will be needed to bring together the life and experiences of patients/laypersons and the medical system on an equal footing.",0
Defining inappropriate thyroid biopsy?-Proposed definition based on clinical evidence and stakeholder engagement.,"PURPOSE: Identify factors that can be used to assess the appropriateness of a thyroid biopsy and propose a pathway to define inappropriate thyroid biopsies in practice. METHODS: We identified factors utilized in clinical guidelines and existing literature to determine the clinical indications for a thyroid biopsy. Subsequently, we assembled a multidisciplinary panel of experts, including patients, clinicians, researchers, and quality experts, to integrate these factors and develop a pathway for assessing the appropriateness of thyroid biopsies. RESULTS: Through literature review and stakeholder engagement, we identified multiple factors to determine if a thyroid biopsy is necessary: ultrasound risk assessment, presence of compressive symptoms and/or clinical suspicion of high-risk thyroid cancer, life expectancy, comorbidity burden, surgical risk, personal risk factors for thyroid cancer, thyroid function levels, local resources and medical expertise and patient values and preferences. We proposed a multiple-tier classification for the appropriateness of thyroid biopsy that begins with ultrasound findings (e.g., size, thyroid cancer risk) and encompasses the evaluation of additional patient-specific factors. CONCLUSION: Assessment of the appropriateness of a thyroid biopsy is possible. Although, thyroid nodule ultrasound risk assessment is a pivotal factor for this assessment, additional factors should be considered (e.g., life expectancy, personal risk factors for thyroid cancer, patient preferences). Yet, additional efforts are needed to operationalize the objective implementation of these factors in clinical practice.",0
Challenges of Shared Decision-making by Clinicians and Patients With Low-risk Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Ethnography.,"IMPORTANCE: Several international guidelines have endorsed more conservative treatment of low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (LRDTC), yet patients are facing more treatment options with similar oncologic outcomes and are expressing feelings of confusion, dissatisfaction, and anxiety. Shared decision-making, which considers the patient's values and preferences along with the most reliable medical evidence, has been proposed to optimize patient satisfaction in the context of the current clinical equipoise. OBJECTIVES: To understand key individual and behavioral factors affecting the patient and clinician decision-making process in treatment decision for LRDTC. EVIDENCE REVIEW: This systematic review and meta-ethnography involved a comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and CINAHL databases for qualitative and mixed-method studies on patient and clinician experiences with the decision-making process for LRDTC treatment. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool; meta-ethnography was used for data analysis. Primary and secondary themes of the included studies were extracted, compared, and translated across articles to produce a lines-of-argument synthesis. FINDINGS: Of 1081 publications identified, 12 articles met the inclusion criteria. The qualitative synthesis produced 4 themes: (1) a bimodal distribution of patient preferences for treatment decisions; (2) clinician anxiety affected equipoise and biased their recommendations; (3) clinicians struggled to identify patient concerns and preferences; and (4) the clinician-patient relationship and psychosocial support were key to shared decision-making but were frequently overlooked. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this systematic review and meta-ethnography emphasize the need for better patient-clinician communication, particularly with respect to eliciting patient concerns and preferences. With an ever-increasing pool of thyroid cancer survivors, future efforts should be directed at establishing and evaluating tools that will aid in shared decision-making for treatment of patients with LRDTC.

Gene therapy preferences and informed decision-making: Results from a National Hemophilia Foundation Community Voices in research survey.,"INTRODUCTION: To inform education and treatment discussions, it is important to understand how persons with haemophilia prefer to learn about and discuss new therapies and to identify variables that influence decision-making. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate preferences and variables which influence decision-making related to gene therapy and other novel haemophilia therapies. METHODS: An online survey was sent to men with severe haemophilia enrolled in the National Hemophilia Foundation Community Voices in Research online platform for patient-powered research. RESULTS: One hundred four men completed the survey including 33% Hispanics, 96 who had had not gene therapy and 71/96 (74%) who were on prophylaxis. Ninety-five percent were somewhat or very familiar with gene therapy. Men with haemophilia obtain information about new therapies from several sources, most commonly their haemophilia treatment team, patient advocacy groups and self-study. Participants identified safety and efficacy as well as other educational needs to inform decision-making. Of those without prior gene therapy, 73% indicated a high likelihood of considering gene therapy. Hispanic ethnicity and government-issued insurance were associated with a higher likelihood of considering gene therapy as a treatment option. CONCLUSION: Haemophilia Treatment Centers and patient advocacy groups must be able to educate persons with haemophilia about aspects of novel therapies which are important to the individual, especially short- and long-term safety and efficacy. Further research is needed to determine how patient activation and health literacy influence decision-making and how to achieve equitable access and valid informed consent for novel therapies.",0
"Atrial fibrillation, cancer and anticancer drugs.","Active cancer is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), which varies depending on the pre-existing substrate (particularly in older patients), the cancer type and stage, and the anticancer therapeutics being taken. To date, studies have not been able to identify the individual contribution of each factor. During anticancer drug therapy, AF may occur with a frequency of ≈ 15-20% according to several factors, including the patient's baseline cardiovascular toxicity risk and the AF-detection strategies used. Many anticancer drugs have been associated with AF or AF reporting, both in terms of incident and recurrent AF, but robust data are lacking. Only bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor associated AF (mainly ibrutinib) has a high level of evidence, with a ≈ 3-4-fold higher risk of AF. AF in patients with active cancer is associated with a twofold higher risk of systemic thromboembolism or stroke, and the ""TBIP"" (Thromboembolic risk, Bleeding risk, drug-drug Interactions, Patient preferences) structured approach must be used to evaluate the need for anticoagulation therapy. AF in patients with active cancer is also associated with a sixfold higher risk of heart failure, and optimal symptom control must be targeted, usually with rate-control drugs (beta-blockers), but a rhythm-control strategy may be proposed in patients remaining symptomatic despite optimal rate-control. AF is generally manageable, with the continuation of anticancer drugs (including ibrutinib); interruption of cancer drugs must be avoided whenever possible and weighed against the risk of cancer progression.",0
Effect of switching from continuous to bilevel positive airway pressure on sleep quality in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: the prospective POP IN VAuto study.,"BACKGROUND: Issues with tolerability and side effects can decrease continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device usage and the benefits of therapy. Different positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy modes providing expiratory pressure relief or using a different pressure during inspiration vs. expiration (bilevel PAP) may alleviate some of these issues. This multicenter, prospective study evaluated the effects of switching from CPAP to bilevel PAP (VAuto mode) on respiratory parameters, device usage, side effects and patient-reported outcomes in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). METHODS: Eligible OSA patients had started CPAP ≥3 months previously, had good compliance (mean 6.1±2.0 h/night) and well-controlled OSA [residual apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 4.9±3.1/h] but had pressure tolerance issues or persistent side effects/discomfort. All were switched from CPAP to bilevel PAP (AirCurve 10 VAuto; ResMed). Effectiveness (residual AHI), sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, therapy-related side effects, and patient satisfaction/preference were assessed after 3 months and 1 year. RESULTS: Forty patients were analyzed (68% male, age 64±11 years, body mass index 30.7±5.8 kg/m(2)). At 3 months and 1 year after switching to bilevel PAP, median [interquartile range] residual AHI was 4/h [2-5.3] and 3.7/h [1.8-5], respectively, and device usage was 7.0 [4.9-7.5] and 6.4 [4.4-7.3] h/night, respectively. Device switch was associated with significant reductions from baseline in expiratory PAP {from 12 [11-13] to 8 [7-9] cmH(2)O at 3 months (P<0.001) and 9 [8-12] cmH(2)O at 1 year (P=0.005)}, 95(th) percentile pressure {from 14 [12-14] to 10 [9-11] and 10 [8-11] cmH2O; P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively} and leak {from 1 [0-6] to 0 [0-1] and 0 [0-2] L/min; P=0.049 and P=0.033, respectively}. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score decreased significantly from baseline to 3 and 6 months [7.2±4.0 to 5.0±3.2 (P=0.005) and 4.5±2.7 (P<0.001), respectively]. CPAP-related mouth dryness, choking sensation and aerophagia were significantly improved one year after switching to bilevel PAP. Bilevel PAP was preferred over CPAP by 90% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Switching to bilevel PAP had several benefits in patients struggling with CPAP, facilitating therapy acceptance and ongoing device usage.",0

Racial disparities in the pharmacological treatment of insomnia: A time-to-event analysis using real-world data.,"OBJECTIVE: Examine the association between race and time to pharmacologic treatment of insomnia in a large multi-institutional cohort. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of electronic medical records from a regional health information exchange. Eligible patients included adults with at least one healthcare visit per year from 2010 to 2019, a new insomnia diagnosis code during the study period, and no prior insomnia diagnosis codes or medications. A Cox frailty model was used to examine the association between race and time to an insomnia medication after diagnosis. RESULTS: In total, 9557 patients were analyzed, 7773 (81.3%) of whom where White, 1294 (13.5%) Black, 238 (2.5%) Other, and 252 (2.6%) unknown race. About 6.2% of Black and 8% of Other race patients received an order for a Food and Drug Administration-approved insomnia medication after diagnosis compared with 13.5% of White patients. Black patients were significantly less likely to have an order for a Food and Drug Administration-approved insomnia medication at all time points (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] range: 0.37-0.73), and patients reporting Other race were less likely to have received an order at 2 (aHR 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.94), 3 (aHR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13-0.79), and 4 years (aHR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.71) of follow-up. Similar results were observed in a sensitivity analysis including off-label medications. CONCLUSIONS: Patients belonging to racial minority groups are less likely to be prescribed an insomnia medication than White patients after accounting for sociodemographic and clinical factors. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which patient preferences and physician perceptions affect these prescribing patterns and investigate potential disparities in nonpharmacologic treatment.",0
"Integrating herbal medicine into oncology care delivery: development, implementation, and evaluation of a novel program.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of a novel program facilitating patient-provider communication about appropriate use of herbal medicine at a large academic cancer center and its impact on patient wellbeing. METHODS: In the Herbal Oncology Program (HOP), integrative medicine providers counseled patients about unmet symptom needs and prescribed traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbs when indicated, taking into consideration the clinical context, patient preference, and research evidence. To evaluate the feasibility and outcomes, we performed a retrospective analysis using medical record data (symptoms and other concerns that motivated patients to seek herbal products, types and numbers of dispensed TCM herbs, and demographic characteristics). We also conducted a survey to assess patient experience and satisfaction. RESULTS: All 851 participants were outpatients, with 712 (84%) in active treatment. HOP dispensed 1266 herbal prescriptions for a range of symptoms, most commonly GI symptoms (467, 37%); pain (353, 28%); and treatment-related fatigue, sleep, and mood disorders (346, 27%). Of 269 patients invited to the survey, 107 (40%) completed it. A majority of respondents 70.9% (73/103) were satisfied with the effectiveness of dispensed herbs in relieving their symptoms, and few 6.7% (7/104) had experienced mild adverse events that resolved after discontinuing herbal use. CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings support the feasibility of integrating herbal medicine into an academic oncology setting. Patient satisfaction with HOP was high, with limited adverse events. The patterns of herbal prescriptions in HOP suggest future areas for clinical research to strengthen the evidence base around safe and effective use.",0
Community-Engaged Research (CEnR) to Address Gaps in Chronic Kidney Disease Education among Underserved Latines-The CARE Study.,"Ensuring equitable chronic kidney disease (CKD) education for Latine patients with low health literacy and low English proficiency stands as a critical challenge, and the ""Caridad Awareness and Education"" (CARE) initiative represents our ongoing effort to address this imperative issue. In collaboration with twenty-three patients living with CKD, diabetes and/or hypertension and twelve trained Community Health Workers (CHWs) from diverse Latine subgroups, we conducted a research initiative funded by the National Kidney Foundation. Our primary objective was to co-design and test culturally tailored patient education materials (PEMs) for underserved Latine adults at risk for or diagnosed with CKD. We effectively integrated Community-Engaged Research (CEnR) principles with a Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach to create a range of CKD-PEM prototypes in Spanish. Patient preferences for printed educational materials were clear. They favored printed materials that incorporated visual content with concise text over digital, email, texts, or online resources and personalized phone outreach and the involvement of CHWs. Additionally, patients identified their unwavering commitment to their families as a forceful motivator for caring for their kidney health. Currently, a culturally and linguistically tailored CKD flipchart for one-on-one education, led by CHWs, is undergoing a pilot testing phase involving a sample of one hundred Latine patients at risk for or diagnosed with CKD. This innovative approach signifies a commitment to amplifying the insights and expertise of the Latine community afflicted by kidney health disparities, effectively embracing a CEnR to forge meaningful and impactful CKD-PEMs.",0
Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Statement: Clinical considerations for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants.,"Respiratory syncytial virus is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract illness globally in children aged <5 years. Each year, approximately 58,000 hospitalizations in the United States are attributed to respiratory syncytial virus. Infants aged ≤6 months experience the most severe morbidity and mortality. Until recently, prevention with the monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, was only offered to infants with high-risk conditions, and treatment primarily consisted of supportive care. Currently, 2 products are approved for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus in infants. These include the Pfizer bivalent recombinant respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein subunit vaccine, administered seasonally to the pregnant person between 32 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation, and the monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab, administered to infants aged up to 8 months entering their first respiratory syncytial virus season. With few exceptions, administering both the vaccine to the pregnant person and the monoclonal antibody to the infant is not recommended. All infants should be protected against respiratory syncytial virus using one of these strategies. Key considerations for pregnant individuals include examining available safety and efficacy data, weighing accessibility and availability, and patient preferences for maternal vaccination vs infant monoclonal antibody treatment. It will be critical for maternal-fetal medicine physicians to provide effective and balanced counseling to aid patients in deciding on a personalized approach to the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus in their infants.",0
Physician awareness of patients' preferred level of involvement in decision-making at the initial urogynecology visit: a randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown up to a 40% discordance between patients' preferred roles in decision-making before and their perceived roles after their visit. This can negatively affect patients' experiences; interventions to minimize this discordance may significantly improve patient satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether physicians' awareness of patients' preferred involvement in decision-making before their initial urogynecology visit affects patients' perceived level of involvement after their visit. STUDY DESIGN: This randomized controlled trial enrolled adult English-speaking women presenting for their initial visit at an academic urogynecology clinic from June 2022 to September 2022. Before the visit, participants completed the Control Preference Scale to determine the patient's preferred level of decision-making: active, collaborative, or passive. The participants were randomized to either the physician team being aware of their decision-making preference before the visit or usual care. The participants were blinded. After the visit, participants again completed a Control Preference Scale and the Patient Global Impression of Improvement, CollaboRATE, patient satisfaction, and health literacy questionnaires. Fisher exact, logistic regression, and generalized estimating equations were used. Based on a 21% difference in preferred and perceived discordance, we calculated the sample size to be 50 patients in each arm to achieve 80% power. RESULTS: Women (n=100) with a mean age of 52.9 years (standard deviation=15.8) participated in the study. Most participants identified as White (73%) and non-Hispanic (70%). Before the visit, most women preferred an active role (61%) and few preferred a passive role (7%). There was no significant difference between the 2 cohorts in the discordance between their pre- and post-Control Preference Scale responses (27% vs 37%; P=.39) or whether their symptoms were much better or very much better following the visit (18% vs 37%; P=.06). However, when asked whether they were completely satisfied with the visit, those assigned to the physician awareness cohort reported higher satisfaction than those in the treatment as usual cohort (100% vs 90%; P=.03). CONCLUSION: Although there was no significant decrease in discordance between the patient's desired and perceived level of decision-making following physician awareness, it had a significant effect on patient satisfaction. All patients whose physicians were aware of their preferences reported complete satisfaction with their visit. Although patient-centered care does not always entail meeting all of the patients' expectations, the mere understanding of their preferences in decision-making can lead to complete patient satisfaction.",0
The application of discrete choice experiments eliciting young peoples' preferences for healthcare: a systematic literature review.,"OBJECTIVES: Understanding young people's preferences for healthcare is critical for reducing the negative effect of undesirable choices. This review aims to synthesise the evidence obtained from discrete choice experiments (DCEs) eliciting young people's preferences for healthcare interventions and service deliveries, specifically, to (1) examine the methodology, including a selection of attributes and levels, experimental design, estimation procedure and validity; (2) evaluate similarities, differences and rigour of designs to the general population DCEs; and, (3) compare the DCEs' application to the seven health priority areas defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO). METHODS: A systematic review searching Medline, EconLIT, PsychINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed up until May 2021. INCLUSION CRITERIA: a DCE, eliciting young peoples' preferences (10-24 years of age), on a healthcare-related topic defined by WHO, peer-reviewed, full-text available in English. A bespoke checklist was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. RESULTS: Eighteen DCE studies were included in the review, exploring interventions and service in sexual and reproductive health (n = 9; 50%), smoking cessation (n = 4; 22%), mental health (n = 1), nutrition (n = 1), unintentional injuries (n = 1), vaccination against severe but rare diseases (n = 1); and diabetes (n = 1). Compared to the general population, DCEs eliciting young people's preferences had a high proportion of monetary measures and a smaller number of choices per respondent with the overwhelming number of surveys using fractional factorial design. The majority of studies were of moderate quality (50-75% of the criteria met). CONCLUSIONS: While identified DCEs touched on most health priority areas, the scope was limited. The conduct and reporting of DCEs with young people could be improved by including the state-of-the-art design, estimation procedures and analysis.",1
"Prevalence, attitudes and concerns toward telepsychiatry and mobile health self-management tools among patients with mental disorders during and after the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide survey in Poland from 2020 to 2023.","INTRODUCTION: Mobile Health (mHealth) is a rapidly growing field of medicine that has the potential to significantly change everyday clinical practice, including in psychiatry. The COVID-19 pandemic and technological developments have accelerated the adoption of telepsychiatry and mobile solutions, but patient perceptions and expectations of mHealth remain a key factor in its implementation. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess (1) the prevalence, (2) attitudes, preferences and (3) concerns about mobile mental health, including telepsychiatry and self-management tools, among patients with mental disorders over the period 2020-2023, i.e., at the onset, peak and after the expiration of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A semi-structured survey was administrated to 354 patients with mental disorders in Poland. The questions were categorized into three section, addressing prevalence, attitudes, and concerns about telepsychiatry and mobile health self-management tools. The survey was conducted continuously from May 2020 to the end of May 2023. RESULT: As many as 95.7% of patients with mental disorders used mobile devices at least once a week. Over the course of 3 years (from 2020 to 2023), there was a significant increase in the readiness of patients to embrace new technologies, with the percentage rising from 20% to 40%. In particular, a remarkable growth in patient preferences for telepsychiatry was observed, with a significant increase from 47% in 2020 to a substantial 96% in 2023. Similarly, mHealth self-management tools were of high interest to patients. In 2020, 62% of patients like the idea of using mobile apps and other mobile health tools to support the care and treatment process. This percentage also increased during the pandemic, reaching 66% in 2023. At the same time, the percentage of patients who have concerns about using m-health solutions has gradually decreased, reaching 35% and 28% in 2023 for telepsychiatry and for the reliability and safety of m-health self-management tools, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the growing acceptance of modern technologies in psychiatric care, with patients showing increased readiness to use telepsychiatry and mobile health self-management tools, in particular mobile applications, after the COVID-19 pandemic. This was triggered by the pandemic, but continues despite its expiry. In the face of patient readiness, the key issue now is to ensure the safety and efficacy of these tools, along with providing clear guidelines for clinicians. It is also necessary to draw the attention of health systems to the widespread implementation of these technologies to improve the care of patients with mental disorders.",0
Satisfaction and preferences among patients with both implant-supported single crown and tooth-supported fixed dental prosthesis: a pilot study.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess patient-reported preferences and outcomes in patients rehabilitated with both an implant-supported single crown (ISC) and a tooth-supported fixed dental prosthesis (FDP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The electronic journal system at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Oslo, was searched to find patients presenting both an ISC and an FDP replacing no more than two teeth between abutments. Identified patients that agreed answered a questionnaire followed by a clinical examination. Descriptive statistics was calculated. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included. The mean function time was 11.8 years for FDPs and 6.6 years for ISCs. All but three patients were satisfied with both rehabilitation modalities. No patients were unsatisfied with aesthetics or function of either rehabilitation. All patients reported satisfactory function of their restorations and reported chewing without problems. The self-reported post-operative complications were few, but less than observed in the clinical examinations. CONCLUSIONS: More patients reported food impaction with their FDP as compared to their ISC. Function and aesthetics of FDPs and ISCs were rated similarly, but more patients found the ISC treatment more uncomfortable. Despite this finding, most patients would prefer to undergo ISC treatment if they were to replace another missing tooth.",0
Do the Few Dictate Care for the Many? Revascularisation Considerations That Go Beyond the Guidelines.,"The burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) is large and growing, commonly presenting with comorbidities and older age. Patients may benefit from coronary revascularisation with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), yet half of patients with CAD who would benefit from revascularisation fall outside the eligibility criteria of trials to date. As such, the choice of revascularisation procedures varies depending on the CAD anatomy and complexity, surgical risk and comorbidities, the patient's preferences and values, and the treating team's expertise. The recent American guidelines on coronary revascularisation are comprehensive in describing recommendations for PCI, CABG, or conservative management in patients with CAD. However, individual challenging patient presentations cannot be fully captured in guidelines. The aim of this narrative review is to summarise common clinical scenarios that are not sufficiently described by contemporary clinical guidelines and trials in order to inform heart team members and trainees about the nuanced considerations and available evidence to manage such cases. We discuss clinical cases that fall beyond the current guidelines and summarise the relevant evidence evaluating coronary revascularisation for these patients. In addition, we highlight gaps in knowledge based on a lack of research (eg, ineligibility of certain patient populations), underrepresentation in research (eg, underenrollment of female and non-White patients), and the surge in newer minimally invasive and hybrid techniques. We argue that ultimately, evidence-based medicine, patient preference, shared decision making, and effective heart team communications are necessary to best manage complex CAD presentations potentially benefitting from revascularisation with CABG or PCI.",0
"Evaluation of Orthodontic Treatment Method Preferences of Dentistry Students, Dentists and Orthodontic Residents.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate orthodontic treatment method preferences among dentistry students, dentists and orthodontic residents taking into account factors such as esthetics, advantage/disadvantage, cost and treatment duration. METHODS: The study was carried out on three groups: dentistry students (n=318), dentists (n=110) and orthodontic residents (n=98), and a 17-question survey was applied. Questionnaire forms included informational photos of conventional metal brackets (CMB), esthetic ceramic brackets (ECB), self-ligating brackets (SLB), clear aligner (CA), and lingual brackets (LB). The participants' preferences for orthodontic treatment methods were evaluated using chi-square analysis, not only between groups but also considering gender and income level. RESULTS: Regarding esthetics, dentists (41%) and orthodontic residents (78%) mostly preferred CA, while dentistry students mostly preferred LB (44%). With regard to advantage/disadvantage, dentistry students (31%) and dentists (39%) mostly preferred SLB, while orthodontic residents mostly preferred CA (55%). Regarding the success of the treatment, all three groups mostly preferred CMB. (respectively 50%; 47%; 72%). While CA was mostly preferred for short-term treatments in all three groups (respectively 40%; 71%; 88%), CMB was mostly preferred for long-term treatments (respectively 35%, 51%, 55%). Gender and income-level differences had little effect on orthodontic treatment method preferences. CONCLUSION: Except for long-term treatments and treatment success, there was generally great interest in CA, especially among orthodontic residents. Ceramic brackets and LB were generally the least preferred treatment methods among dentistry students, dentists, and orthodontic residents.",0
Usual Source of Care and Contraceptive Use.,"BACKGROUND: A high proportion of people in the United States at risk of unintended pregnancy also have limited primary care access. STUDY DESIGN: We pooled data for analyses from separate 2015-2017 and 2017-2019 waves of the National Survey of Family Growth. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate associations between the usual source of health care and self-reported use of a comprehensive range of contraceptive options, as well as alignment between patient preference and the current method. RESULTS: Compared with having a private doctor or Health Maintenance Organization, not having a usual source of care was associated with lower odds of using short-term hormonal methods (OR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.40-0.73, for an 11 percentage point lower rate); higher odds of using time-based methods (OR=1.47, 95% CI: 1.10-1.97, for a 6 percentage point higher rate); and higher odds of preferring a contraceptive method other than the one most recently used (OR=1.39, 95% CI: 1.01-1.90, for a 6 percentage point higher probability). Reliance on an emergency department as a usual source of care was not associated with contraceptive use or satisfaction with the method used. Reliance on urgent care was associated only with higher odds of using time-based methods (OR=1.60, 95% CI: 1.03-2.50, for a 7 percentage point higher rate). Clinic-based usual care was not associated with any differences in contraceptive use but was associated with preferring a contraceptive method other than the one most recently used (OR=1.65, 95% CI: 1.21-2.25, for an 8 percentage point higher probability). CONCLUSIONS: All sources of usual care can improve contraceptive access.",0
Relugolix in Clinical Practice: The Best Route for All?,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been a mainstay of prostate cancer treatment for decades. Relugolix was FDA-approved in 2020 and is currently the only ADT option via an oral route. While the opportunity to use an oral medication for this indication has some advantages, a balanced discussion is required to understand in what clinical settings this agent truly has benefit over long-acting injectable formulations of ADT. Furthermore, patient preference, compliance, financial toxicity, and perhaps most importantly, pharmacologic characteristics must be considered.",0
Quantifying the association of individual-level characteristics with disparities in kidney transplant waitlist addition among people with HIV.,"BACKGROUND: Over 45% of people with HIV (PWH) in the United States at least 50 years old and are at heightened risk of aging-related comorbidities including end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), for which kidney transplant is the optimal treatment. Among ESKD patients, PWH have lower likelihood of waitlisting, a requisite step in the transplant process, than individuals without HIV. It is unknown what proportion of the inequity by HIV status can be explained by demographics, medical characteristics, substance use history, and geography. METHODS: The United States Renal Data System, a national database of all individuals ESKD, was used to create a cohort of people with and without HIV through Medicare claims linkage (2007-2017). The primary outcome was waitlisting. Inverse odds ratio weighting was conducted to assess what proportion of the disparity by HIV status could be explained by individual characteristics. RESULTS: Six thousand two hundred and fifty PWH were significantly younger at ESKD diagnosis and more commonly Black with fewer comorbidities. PWH were more frequently characterized as using tobacco, alcohol and drugs. Positive HIV-status was associated with 57% lower likelihood of waitlisting [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46-0.48, P  < 0.001]. Controlling for demographics, medical characteristics, substance use and geography explained 39.8% of this observed disparity (aHR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.59-0.79, P  < 0.001). CONCLUSION: PWH were significantly less likely to be waitlisted, and 60.2% of that disparity remained unexplained. HIV characteristics such as CD4 + counts, viral loads, antiretroviral therapy adherence, as well as patient preferences and provider decision-making warrant further study.",0
Shared decision making in the treatment of multiple sclerosis: A consensus based on Delphi methodology.,"Shared decision making is a way of incorporating patients' preferences and values into the decisions regarding the treatment and follow-up plan for the condition that affects them. It is currently applied mainly in the context of chronic disorders for which there is no cure available but nevertheless many therapeutic alternatives, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Current views and opinions on shared decision making for the treatment of MS are discussed in this consensus based on a modified Delphi method that included a group of neurologists from Argentina. A set of statements was defined by the experts and seeks to serve as a guide to apply this concept in clinical practice.",0
