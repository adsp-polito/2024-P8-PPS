Improving methods of clinical practice guidelines: From guidelines to pathways to fast-and-frugal trees and decision analysis to develop individualised patient care.,"BACKGROUND: Current methods for developing clinical practice guidelines have several limitations: they are characterised by the ""black box"" operation-a process with defined inputs and outputs but an incomplete understanding of its internal workings; they have ""the integration problem""-a lack of framework for explicitly integrating factors such as patient preferences and trade-offs between benefits and harms; they generate one recommendation at a time that typically are not connected in a coherent analytical framework; and they apply to ""average"" patients, while clinicians and their patients seek advice tailored to individual circumstances. METHODS: We propose augmenting the current guideline development method by converting evidence-based pathways into fast-and-frugal decision trees (FFTs) and integrating them with generalised decision curve analysis to formulate clear, individualised management recommendations. RESULTS: We illustrate the process by developing recommendations for the management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). We converted evidence-based pathways for HIT, developed by the American Society of Hematology, into an FFT. Here, we consider only thrombotic complications and major bleeding. We leveraged the predictive potential of FFTs to compare the effects of argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) using generalised decision curve analysis. We found that DOACs were superior to other treatments if the FFT-predicted probability of HIT exceeded 3%. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed analytical framework connects guidelines, pathways, FFTs, and decision analysis, offering risk-tailored personalised recommendations and addressing current guideline development critiques.",0
Patient preferences in chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases potentially treated with biological drugs: discrete choice analysis using real-world data analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) represent a high burden due to their chronicity, high prevalence, and associated comorbidities. Chronic patients' preferences must be considered in IMIDs treatment and follow-up. The objective of this study was to further understand patient's preferences in private settings. METHODS: A literature review was performed to choose the most relevant criteria for patients. A D-efficient discrete choice experiment was designed to elicit preferences of adult patients with IMIDs and potential biological treatment prescription. Participants were collected from private practices (rheumatology, dermatology, and gastroenterology) from February to May 2022. Patients chose between option pairs, characterized by six health-care attributes, as well as monthly out-of-pocket drug price. Responses were analyzed through a conditional logit model. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients answered the questionnaire. The most frequent pathologies were Rheumatoid Arthritis (31%) and Psoriatic Arthritis (26%). The most relevant criteria were choosing the preferred physician (OR 2.25 [SD0.26]); reducing time until visit with specialist (OR 1.79 [SD0.20]), access through primary care (OR 1.60 [SD0.08]), and an increase in monthly out-of-pocket price from 100€ to 300€ (OR 0.55 [SD0.06]) and to 600€ (OR 0.08 [SD0.02]). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic IMIDs patients showed a preference toward a faster, personalized service, even with a trade-off in terms of out-of-pocket price.",1
Discrete choice experiment versus swing-weighting: A head-to-head comparison of diabetic patient preferences for glucose-monitoring devices.,"INTRODUCTION: Limited evidence exists for how patient preference elicitation methods compare directly. This study compares a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and swing-weighting (SW) by eliciting preferences for glucose-monitoring devices in a population of diabetes patients. METHODS: A sample of Dutch adults with type 1 or 2 diabetes (n = 459) completed an online survey assessing their preferences for glucose-monitoring devices, consisting of both a DCE and a SW exercise. Half the sample completed the DCE first; the other half completed the SW first. For the DCE, the relative importance of the attributes of the devices was determined using a mixed-logit model. For the SW, the relative importance of the attributes was based on ranks and points allocated to the 'swing' from the worst to the best level of the attribute. The preference outcomes and self-reported response burden were directly compared between the two methods. RESULTS: Participants reported they perceived the DCE to be easier to understand and answer compared to the SW. Both methods revealed that cost and precision of the device were the most important attributes. However, the DCE had a 14.9-fold difference between the most and least important attribute, while the SW had a 1.4-fold difference. The weights derived from the SW were almost evenly distributed between all attributes. CONCLUSIONS: The DCE was better received by participants, and generated larger weight differences between each attribute level, making it the more informative method in our case study. This method comparison provides further evidence of the degree of method suitability and trustworthiness.",1
Linking Patients' Goals and Priorities to Recommendations for Medication Changes in a Polypharmacy-Focused Structured Clinical Pathway.,"Polypharmacy is associated with poorer health outcomes in older adults. It is challenging to minimize the harmful effects of medications while maximizing benefits of single-disease-focused recommendations. Integrating patient input can balance these factors. The objectives are to describe the goals, priorities, and preferences of participants asked about these in a structured process to polypharmacy, and to describe the extent that decision-making within the process mapped onto these, signaling a patient-centered approach. This is a single-group quasi-experimental study, nested within a feasibility randomized controlled trial. Patient goals and priorities were mapped to medication recommendations made during the intervention. Overall, there were 33 participants who reported 55 functional goals and 66 symptom priorities, and 16 participants reported unwanted medications. Overall, 154 recommendations for medication alterations occurred. Of those, 68 (44%) recommendations mapped to the individual's goals and priorities, whereas the rest were based on clinical judgment where no priorities were expressed. Our results signal this process supports a patient-centered approach: allowing conversations around goals and priorities in a structured process to polypharmacy should be integrated into subsequent medication decisions.",0
Racial Disparity in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Treatment and Survival in the United States.,"INTRODUCTION: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has a higher incidence and prevalence than esophageal adenocarcinoma among Black individuals in the United States. Black individuals have lower ESCC survival. These racial disparities have not been thoroughly investigated. We examined the disparity in treatment and survival stratified by ESCC stage at diagnosis. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried to identify patients with ESCC between 2000 and 2019. The identified cohort was divided into subgroups by race. Patient and cancer characteristics, treatment received, and survival rates were compared across the racial subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 23,768 patients with ESCC were identified. Compared with White individuals, Black individuals were younger and had more distant disease during diagnosis (distant disease: 26.7% vs 23.8%, P < 0.001). Black individuals had lower age-standardized 5-year survival for localized (survival % [95% confidence interval]: 19.3% [16-22.8] vs 27.6% [25.1-30.2]), regional (14.3% [12-16.7] vs 21.1% [19.6-22.7]), and distant (2.9% [1.9-4.1] vs 6.5% [5.5-7.5]) disease. Black individuals were less likely to receive chemotherapy (54.7% vs 57.5%, P = 0.001), radiation (58.5% vs 60.4%, P = 0.03), and surgery (11.4% vs 16.3%, P < 0.0001). DISCUSSION: Black individuals with ESCC have a lower survival rate than White individuals. This could be related to presenting at a later stage but also disparities in which treatments they receive even among individuals with the same stage of disease. To what extent these disparities in receipt of treatment is due to structural racism, social determinants of health, implicit bias, or patient preferences deserves further study.",0
Using MaxDiff Analysis to Elicit Patients' Treatment Preferences for Distal Radius Fractures in Patients Aged 60 Years and Older.,"PURPOSE: The objective of our study was to determine how the attributes of surgical and nonsurgical distal radius fracture (DRF) treatments affect patient treatment preferences. METHODS: Two hundred fifty patients aged 60 years and older were contacted from a single-hand surgeon's practice, and 172 chose to participate. We built a series of best-worst scaling experiments for the MaxDiff analysis to determine the relative importance of treatment attributes. Hierarchical Bayes analysis was used to generate individual-level item scores (ISs) for each attribute that together have a total sum of 100. RESULTS: One hundred general hand clinic patients without a history of a DRF and 43 patients with a history of a DRF completed the survey. For the general hand clinic patients, the most important attributes to avoid when choosing a DRF treatment (in descending order) were the longer time to full recovery (IS, 24.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.4-26.3), longer time spent in a cast (IS, 22.8; 95% CI, 21.5-24.2), and higher complication rates (IS, 18.4; 95% CI, 16.9-19.8). Meanwhile, for patients with a history of a DRF, the most important attributes to avoid (in descending order) were a longer time to full recovery (IS, 25.6; 95% CI, 23.3-27.9), longer time spent in a cast (IS, 22.8; 95% CI, 19.9-25.7), and abnormal alignment of the radius on x-ray (IS, 18.3; 95% CI, 15.4-21.3). For both the groups, the least concerning attributes based on the IS were appearance-scar, appearance-bump, and the need for anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Eliciting patient preferences is a vital component of shared decision-making and advancing patient-centered care. As conceptualized in this MaxDiff analysis, when choosing a DRF treatment, patients mostly want to avoid a longer time to full recovery and a longer time in a cast, whereas patients have the least concern about appearance and need for anesthesia. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Eliciting patient preferences is a vital component of shared decision-making. Our results may provide guidance to surgeons in discussions on the relative benefits of surgical and nonsurgical DRF treatments, by quantifying the most and least important factors to patients.",1
Development of vaccines for Chagas disease (CRUZIVAX): stakeholders' preferences and potential impacts on healthcare.,"A vaccine for Chagas disease does not currently exist. This study aims to inform the development of two vaccines for the prevention and treatment of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and guide their pre-clinical phase up to clinical phase I. The three main objectives are: 1) to explore patients' and policy makers' preferences on the candidate vaccines in Argentina and Spain; 2) to investigate health-related quality of life of patients affected by Chagas disease; and 3) to assess the potential health provider savings associated with the vaccines, in terms of resource use and health care costs. Discrete choice experiments will be employed to estimate and characterize the theoretical demand for the vaccines and investigate patients' and policy makers' preferences. Health-related quality of life will be assessed using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Resources use and costs associated with Chagas disease will be investigated using information from the databases of the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona.",1
Deactivation of Left Ventricular Assist Devices at the End of Life: Narrative Review and Ethical Framework.,"Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have become an increasingly common advanced therapy in patients with severe symptomatic heart failure. Their unique nature in prolonging life through incorporation into the circulatory system raises ethical questions regarding patient identity and values, device ontology, and treatment categorization; approaching requests for LVAD deactivation requires consideration of these factors, among others. To that end, clinicians would benefit from a deeper understanding of: 1) the history and nature of LVADs; 2) the wider context of device deactivation and associated ethical considerations; and 3) an introductory framework incorporating best practices in requests for LVAD deactivation (specifically in controversial situations without obvious medical or device-related complications). In such decisions, heart failure teams can safeguard patient preferences without compromising ethical practice through more explicit advance care planning before LVAD implantation, early integration of hospice and palliative medicine specialists (maintained throughout the disease process), and further research interrogating behaviors and attitudes related to LVAD deactivation.",0
In the eyes of the beholders: Subjective experiences of positive symptoms among patients with symptoms of psychosis seeking psychotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Reduction of positive symptoms is often the focus of psychiatric treatment for patients with psychosis; however, it is becoming increasingly clear that some patients experience ambivalence towards positive symptoms or may even experience them as pleasant. The present study extends upon work from online studies of patients without verified diagnoses. The first aim was to examine the frequency with which patients report negative, neutral or even positive appraisals of positive symptoms. A second aim was to identify whether these appraisals were associated with medication adherence. METHODS: One-hundred twelve treatment-seeking patients with current symptoms of psychosis completed the Subjective Perception of Positive Symptoms-Revised (SUPPOSY-R), a scale assessing appraisals of positive symptoms (e.g., gain from illness, impact on daily life), as well as questions regarding medication adherence. RESULTS: Although most patients reported experiencing positive symptoms as predominantly unpleasant, appraisals differed between symptom clusters and up to 54.4 % reported that they would miss at least some aspects of positive symptoms should they disappear. Patients particularly welcomed the disappearance of auditory hallucinations (71.2 %). Symptom appraisal was not significantly associated with medication compliance (p > .17); however, more patients with low medication adherence reported they would feel at least some regret if their symptoms were to completely disappear (48.9 %, n = 23) versus patients with high adherence (41.7 %, n = 20). DISCUSSION: Ambivalent or positive appraisals of positive symptoms are lower among treatment-seeking patients compared to patients recruited for online studies, who may not be actively seeking treatment. Auditory hallucinations may cause most distress among treatment-seeking patients. A collaborative approach including assessment of possible positive appraisals of symptoms is important when identifying treatment goals.",0
Influence of Self-Reported Health Impairments on German EQ-5D-5L Values.,"OBJECTIVES: The German EQ-5D-5L value set is based on the average preferences of the general population. Nevertheless, in Germany, there is an ongoing debate about the appropriateness of using general population preferences and whether patient preferences should be used instead. Thus, this research aimed to determine the robustness of the German EQ-5D-5L valuation data for the general population compared with those with health impairments. METHODS: Subgroups were built on the self-reported quality of life, measured with the EQ-5D-5L. To identify which groups significantly influenced the value set, different regression models, including dummy variables for the subgroups, were tested while controlling for preference heterogeneity. Backward selection based on the Akaike information criterion led to significant subgroup dummies, which were analyzed in more detail. For each significant subgroup, the value set model was estimated separately. The models were then compared. Sociodemographics of the subgroups were considered. RESULTS: Three significant dummies were identified: state 11111, severity levels 5 to 7, and self-reported problems with pain/discomfort. The value sets for the 6 subgroups were compared with the national German value set, showing only marginal deviations. The mean absolute deviation ranged from 0.004 to 0.013. No different densities were identified for the decrements of the different value sets. CONCLUSIONS: People with self-reported health impairments do not have different EQ-5D-5L health state preferences compared with the German general population. Further research is needed to determine whether the presence of a chronic health condition has a larger influence on health state valuation than the general population.",0
Prospective Six-Month Analysis of Multiarea Burst Spinal Cord Stimulation: Correlating Intraoperative Neuromonitoring With Postoperative Programming and Clinical Outcomes.,"INTRODUCTION: DeRidder burst spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has shown superior relief from overall pain to traditional tonic neurostimulation therapies and a reduction in back and leg pain. However, nearly 80% of patients have two or more noncontiguous pain areas. This affects the ability to effectively program stimulation and deliver long-term efficacy of the therapy. Multiple DeRidder burst region programming is an option to treat multisite pain by interleaving stimulation at multiple areas along the spinal cord. Previous intraoperative neuromonitoring studies have shown that DeRidder burst stimulation provides broader myotomal coverage at a lower recruitment threshold. The goal of this study is to correlate intraoperative electromyogram (EMG) threshold and postsynaptic excitability with postoperative paresthesia thresholds and optimal burst stimulation programming. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Neuromonitoring was performed during permanent implant of SCS leads in ten patients diagnosed with chronic intractable back and/or leg pain. Each patient underwent the surgical placement of a Penta Paddle electrode through laminectomy at the T8-T11 spinal levels. Subdermal electrode needles were placed into lower extremity muscle groups, in addition to the rectus abdominis muscles, for EMG recording. Evoked responses were compared across multiple trials of burst stimulation in which the number of independent burst areas was varied. After intraoperative data collection, all patients were programmed with single- and multiarea DeRidder burst. Intermittent dosing was delivered at 30:90, 120:360, 120:720, and 120:1440 (seconds ON/OFF) intervals. Numerical rating scale (NRS) and Patient Global Impression of Change scores were evaluated at one, two, three, four, and six months after permanent implant. RESULTS: The thresholds for EMG recruitment after DeRidder burst differed across all patients owing to anatomical and physiological variations. After a 30-second dose of stimulation, the average decrease in thresholds was 1.25 mA for two-area and 0.9 mA for four-area DeRidder burst. Furthermore, a 30-second dose of multisite DeRidder burst produced a 0.25 mA reduction in the postoperative paresthesia thresholds. Across all patients, the baseline NRS score was 6.5 ± 0.5, and the NRS score after single or multiarea DeRidder burst therapy was 2.87 ± 1.50. Eight of ten patients reported a ≥50% decrease in their pain scores through the six-month follow-up visit. Pain outcomes using intermittent multiarea stimulation with longer OFF times (120:360, 120:720, 120:1440) were comparable to those using single-area DeRidder burst at 30:90 up to six months after implant with patient preference being two-area DeRidder burst. CONCLUSIONS: This study aims to evaluate the use of intraoperative neuromonitoring to optimize stimulation programming for multisite pain and correlate it with postoperative programming and efficacy. These results suggest that multisite programming can be used to further customize DeRidder burst stimulation to each individual patient and improve outcomes and quality of life for patients receiving SCS therapy for multisite pain.",0
Telemedicine for Neurosurgery Consultations at a Pituitary Center of Excellence: Patient Preference and Willingness to Proceed with Surgery.,"Objective  The purpose of this study was to evaluate pituitary tumor patient satisfaction with telemedicine, patient preference for telemedicine, potential socioeconomic benefit of telemedicine, and patients' willingness to proceed with surgery based on a telemedicine visit alone. Method  In total, 134 patients who had pituitary surgery and a telemedicine visit during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (April 23, 2020-March 4, 2021) were called to participate in a 13-part questionnaire. Chi-square, ANOVA, and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were used to determine significance. Result  Of 134 patients contacted, 90 responded (67%). Ninety-five percent were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with their telemedicine visit, with 62% stating their visit was ""the same"" or ""better"" than previous in-person appointments. Eighty-two percent of the patients rated their telemedicine visit as ""easy"" or ""very easy."" On average, patients saved 150 minutes by using telemedicine compared with patient reported in-person visit times. Seventy-seven percent of patients reported the need to take off from work for in-person visits, compared with just 12% when using telemedicine. Forty-nine percent of patients preferred in-person visits, 34% preferred telemedicine, and 17% had no preference. Fifty percent of patients said they would feel comfortable proceeding with surgery based on a telemedicine visit alone. Patients with both initial evaluation and follow-up conducted via telemedicine were more likely to feel comfortable proceeding with surgery based on a telemedicine visit alone compared with patients who had only follow-up telemedicine visits ( p  = 0.051). Conclusion  Many patients are satisfied with telemedicine visits and feel comfortable proceeding with surgery based on a telemedicine visit alone. Telemedicine is an important adjunct to increase access to care at a Pituitary Center of Excellence.",0
A discrete choice experiment to quantify the influence of trial features on the decision to participate in cystic fibrosis trials.,"BACKGROUND: Patient-centred trial design optimises recruitment and retention, reduces trial failure rates and increases the diversity of trial cohorts. This allows safe and effective treatments to reach clinic more quickly. To achieve this, patients' views must be incorporated into trial design. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was used to quantify preferences of pwCF for trials features; medicine type, trial location, stipend, washout, drug access on trial completion and trial design. Respondents were presented pairs of hypothetical trial scenarios with different level combinations assigned through experimental design. Respondents were asked to pick their preferred option or decline both. The cross-sectional data were explored using a Random Parameters Logit model. RESULTS: We received 207 eligible responses between Oct2020-Jan2021. The strongest influence on the decision to participate was trial location; pwCF favour participation at their usual clinical centre. Greater travel distances made respondents less willing to participate. Post-trial drug access ranked second. pwCF would rather participate in modulator trials than trials of other drugs. In general, pwCF did not favour a washout period, but were more prepared to washout non-modulators than modulators. Stipend provision was not ranked highly, but higher stipends increased intention to participate. Trial design (placebo vs open-label) had minimal influence on the decision to participate. There are complex interactions between placebos and washouts. CONCLUSIONS: We used quantitative methods to systematically elicit preferences of pwCF for clinical trials' features. We explore the relevance of our findings to trial design and delivery in the current CF trials landscape.",1
Women's needs for lifestyle risk reduction engagement during the interconception period: a scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Unhealthy lifestyle is responsible for many chronic conditions, and antenatal engagement with women about lifestyle behaviours can be too late to prevent some adverse pregnancy outcomes and subsequent childhood risks. To reduce the risk of future adverse outcomes, the interconception period is an opportunity to implement positive health changes. The aim of this scoping review was to explore women's needs for lifestyle risk reduction engagement during the interconception period. METHODS: The JBI methodology guided our scoping review. Six databases were searched for peer-reviewed, English-language research papers published between 2010 and 2021 on topics including perceptions, attitudes, lifestyle, postpartum, preconception and interconception. Title-abstract and full text screening was independently undertaken by two authors. Included papers' reference lists were searched to find additional papers. The main concepts were then identified using a descriptive and tabular approach. RESULTS: A total of 1734 papers were screened and 33 met our inclusion criteria. Most included papers (82%, n=27) reported on nutrition and/or physical activity. Papers identified interconception through postpartum and/or preconception. Women's self-management needs for lifestyle risk reduction engagement during interconception included: informational needs, managing competing priorities, physical and mental health, self-perception and motivation, access to services and professional support, and family and peer networks. CONCLUSIONS: There is a range of challenges for women to engage in lifestyle risk reduction during interconception. To enable women's preferences for how lifestyle risk reduction activities can be enacted, issues including childcare, ongoing and tailored health professional support, domestic support, cost and health literacy need to be addressed.",0
"Introduction of the L-PAP Flap: Bipedicled, Conjoined, and Stacked Thigh-Based Flaps for Autologous Breast Reconstruction.","SUMMARY: Thigh-based flaps are increasingly popular options for autologous breast reconstruction in the setting of abdominal donor-site inadequacy, previous surgery, or patient preference, but the volume and skin associated with these flaps are often lacking relative to the abdomen. An individualized, shared decision-making approach to donor-site selection was adopted based on body shape, surgical history, lifestyle, reconstructive needs, and patient expectations. Different thigh-based flaps combined in stacked, bipedicled, or conjoined configurations were selected to maximize efficient use of available soft-tissue skin and volume while optimizing donor-site aesthetics. A total of 23 thigh-based stacked, bipedicled, or conjoined profunda artery perforator (PAP), lateral thigh perforator (LTP), or gracilis musculocutaneous flap components were used in six patients. Configurations included bilateral stacked PAP and LTP flaps, bipedicled posterolateral thigh flaps based on the LTP and PAP (L-PAP), and bipedicled thigh flaps based on the gracilis and PAP pedicles. Most anastomoses were performed to the antegrade and retrograde internal mammary vessels; intraflap anastomoses were performed in one case. There were no partial or total flap losses. There was one donor-site seroma. Design of stacked, bipedicled, and conjoined thigh-based flaps using multiple conventional flap components allows for tailored approaches to donor-site utilization based on individual body shape in selected patients. Bipedicled design with the L-PAP flap represents one strategy in appropriate cases to overcome skin and volume deficiencies while facilitating coning and projection. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.",0
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Dental Preferences of Patients at Private University Hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","Studies that particularly look into how the pandemic has affected Saudi Arabian patients' dental preferences are scarce. The majority of the research done so far has focused on the pandemic's broad effects on oral health rather than the specific changes in patient preferences for dental care. Therefore, the primary goal of the study was to examine how patients at a private university dental hospital underwent dental procedures both before and after the pandemic. The study is a retrospective analysis of patient data from March 2019 to February 2022 obtained from electronic hospital records (Dentoplus). The data extracted information pertaining to the number of patients and their periodic visits. The data was examined via statistical tests. At 0.05, the significance level was chosen. According to the research, compared to non-lockdown times, lockdown times saw a considerable drop in the number of patients scheduling appointments. There was also a significant decrease in the number of first-time patients during lockdown periods. The study also revealed a significant increase in the number of cancelled appointments and patients who discontinued treatment during lockdown periods. The age and gender of the patients did not have a significant effect on these findings. The study's findings suggest that dental professionals need to be aware of these changes in patient behavior and adapt their services accordingly. Dental clinics may need to focus on promoting their services and ensuring that patients feel safe and comfortable seeking dental care during the pandemic.",0
"Trial of labor after cesarean, vaginal birth after cesarean, and the risk of uterine rupture: an expert review.","The decision to pursue a trial of labor after cesarean delivery is complex and depends on patient preference, the likelihood of successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery, assessment of the risks vs benefits of trial of labor after cesarean delivery, and available resources to support safe trial of labor after cesarean delivery at the planned birthing center. The most feared complication of trial of labor after cesarean delivery is uterine rupture, which can have catastrophic consequences, including substantial maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Although the absolute risk of uterine rupture is low, several clinical, historical, obstetrical, and intrapartum factors have been associated with increased risk. It is therefore critical for clinicians managing patients during trial of labor after cesarean delivery to be aware of these risk factors to appropriately select candidates for trial of labor after cesarean delivery and maximize the safety and benefits while minimizing the risks. Caution is advised when considering labor augmentation and induction in patients with a previous cesarean delivery. With established hospital safety protocols that dictate close maternal and fetal monitoring, avoidance of prostaglandins, and careful titration of oxytocin infusion when induction agents are needed, spontaneous and induced trial of labor after cesarean delivery are safe and should be offered to most patients with 1 previous low transverse, low vertical, or unknown uterine incision after appropriate evaluation, counseling, planning, and shared decision-making. Future research should focus on clarifying true risk factors and identifying the optimal approach to intrapartum and induction management, tools for antenatal prediction, and strategies for prevention of uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean delivery. A better understanding will facilitate patient counseling, support efforts to improve trial of labor after cesarean delivery and vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates, and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean delivery.",0
Do Patients Want to Be Involved in Their Carpal Tunnel Surgery Decisions? A Multicenter Study.,"PURPOSE: Carpal tunnel syndrome requires multiple decisions during its management, including regarding preoperative studies, surgical technique, and postoperative wound management. Whether patients have varying preferences for the degree to which they share in decisions during different phases of care has not been explored. The goal of our study was to evaluate the degree to which patients want to be involved along the care pathway in the management of carpal tunnel syndrome. METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter study of patients undergoing carpal tunnel surgery at 5 academic medical centers. Patients received a 27-item questionnaire to rate their preferred level of involvement for decisions made during 3 phases of care for carpal tunnel surgery: preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative. Preferences for participation were quantified using the Control Preferences Scale. These questions were scored on a scale of 0 to 4, with patient-only decisions scoring 0, semiactive decisions scoring 1, equally collaborative decisions scoring 2, semipassive decisions scoring 3, and physician-only decisions scoring 4. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients completed the survey between November 2018 and April 2019. Overall, patients preferred semipassive decisions in all phases of care (median score, 3). Patients preferred equally collaborative decisions for preoperative decisions (median score, 2). Patients preferred a semipassive decision-making role for intraoperative and postoperative decisions (median score, 3), suggesting these did not need to be equally shared. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome prefer varying degrees of involvement in the decision-making process of their care and prefer a semipassive role in intraoperative and postoperative decisions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Strategies to engage patients to varying degrees for all decisions during the management of carpal tunnel syndrome, such as decision aids for preoperative surgical decisions and educational handouts for intraoperative decisions, may facilitate aligning decisions with patient preferences for shared decision-making.",0
Scoping review of values elicitation tools for treatment decisions in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment choices in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) involve consideration of tradeoffs between the benefits, toxicities, inconvenience, and costs. Stated preference elicitation methods have been used in the medical field to help evaluate complex treatment decision-making. The aim of this study was to conduct a scoping review to assess the evidence base for the use of preference elicitation tools or willingness to pay/willingness to accept methods for HCC treatment decision-making from both the patient and provider perspective. METHODS: We performed a scoping review to identify abstracts or manuscripts focused on the role preference elicitation tools or willingness to pay/willingness to accept methods for HCC treatment options among patients, caregivers, and/or providers. Two researchers independently screened full-text references and resolved conflicts through discussion. We summarized key findings, including the type and setting of preference-elicitation tools used for HCC treatment decisions. RESULTS: Ten published abstracts or manuscripts evaluated the role of preference elicitation tools for HCC treatments. The studies revealed several attributes that are considered by patients and providers making HCC treatment decisions. Many of the studies reviewed suggested that while patients place the most value on extending their overall survival, they are willing to forgo overall survival to avoid risks of treatments and maintain quality of life. Studies of physicians and surgeons found that provider preferences are dependent on patient characteristics, provider specialty, and surgeon or hospital-related factors. CONCLUSION: This scoping review explored both patient and physician preferences towards treatment modalities in all stages of HCC. The studies revealed a large scope of potential attributes that may be important to patients and that many patients are willing to forgo survival to maintain quality of life. Further research should explore both preference elicitation of currently available and emerging therapies for HCC as well as the use of this data to develop patient-facing tools to assist in navigating treatment options.",1
Migraine Patient Care Model Preferences in a Community Practice.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Developing high-value care models with limited resources for large populations of individuals with migraine requires advanced understanding of patient preferences for care delivery methods. In this study, we aimed to inform the development of migraine care models by assessing patient preferences for types of care delivery and determining differences based on migraine frequency and disability. METHODS: We analyzed unpublished data from a cross-sectional survey of 516 randomly selected individuals with migraine within a community practice associated with Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. RESULTS: Individuals with chronic migraine, compared with those with episodic migraine, were more likely to prefer a visit with a neurologist (p = 0.0005), synchronous telephone conference with primary care provider (PCP) and neurologist (p = 0.0102), and a written migraine action plan in the medical record (p = 0.0343). Compared with those with mild/no disability, individuals with moderate-to-severe disability were more likely to prefer a visit with a neurologist (p < 0.0001), synchronous video or telephone conference with PCP and neurologist (p < 0.0001), PCP communication with neurologist (p = 0.0099), electronic message to primary care team with access to neurologist (p = 0.0216), and written action plan in the medical record (p = 0.0011). Collectively, individuals most preferred telephone follow-up and least preferred communications with a nurse or pharmacist or generalized education (all p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: We observed differences in migraine care delivery preferences between migraine frequency and level of migraine disability. Observations support development of care pathways that include a written migraine action plan, primary care-neurology collaboration including nontraditional interactions, and prioritization of traditional neurology consultation for the most disabled patients.",0
Patients' Preferences Towards Decision Counseling for Active Surveillance After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Esophageal Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Decision counseling (DC) is offered to enable patients to reflect on their treatment preferences and to think through the consequences of alternative treatment options. However, the timing of DC is debatable. In this study, patients who underwent DC at different times were interviewed about their experiences, specifically focusing on the timing of DC. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer eligible for participation in a prospective cohort study on active surveillance (SANO-2 study) were offered DC either before or after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). Structured interviews were conducted by phone 1 week after DC, and responses were analyzed using frequency counts for the answers to set response categories. The primary outcome was the preferred time to receive DC, while the secondary outcome was the overall experience of patients with DC. RESULTS: Overall, 40 patients were offered DC between 2021 and 2023. Patients who had counseling before the start of nCRT (n = 20) were satisfied with the timing of DC. Of the 20 patients who had DC after nCRT, 6 would have preferred counseling at an earlier time point. Patients who had DC both before or after the completion of nCRT reflected positively on DC. CONCLUSION: It is recommended to introduce the option of DC as early as possible and discuss with the patient at which moment during the decision-making process they prefer to discuss all treatment options more extensively.",0
Mixed methods study of attitudes on location of gynaecological oncology outpatient care: a patient and healthcare professional questionnaire.,"OBJECTIVE: Gynaecological oncology place of care is often based on evolution of services, along historical professional boundaries, rather than user needs or preferences. We aimed to assess existing evidence, gather views of patients in the UK on their preferred place of outpatient care for gynaecological malignancies and evaluate alignment with preferences of healthcare professionals (HCP). METHODS: We performed a mixed methods study, including a scoping review, a patient survey and a healthcare practitioner questionnaire. We collected quantitative and qualitative data, performing content analysis to determine current practice and impact on patients. RESULTS: No studies were identified in our scoping review. We received responses from 159 patients and 54 gynaecological oncology HCPs. There was a strong preference for a dedicated gynaecological oncology setting (89% somewhat or very happy) (p<0.0001). Fifty-three percent of patients were somewhat or very unhappy to have care colocated with general obstetrics and gynaecology services. Specifically, two key themes were identified through content analysis of qualitative data from patients: 'environment and getting this right is vital'; and 'our cancer should be the priority'. HCPs underestimated the strong patient preference to be seen in dedicated units. Of those who see patients within general obstetrics and gynaecology, only 50% said patients were seen at separate times/locations from obstetric patients. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the significant impact of place of care on gynaecological oncology patients, which may be underestimated by HCPs.",0
Patient preferences for stress urinary incontinence treatments: a discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: To elicit and value patient preferences for the processes and outcomes of surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women. DESIGN: A discrete choice experiment survey to elicit preferences for type of anaesthesia, postoperative recovery time, treatment success, adverse events, impact on daily activities and cost. An experimental design generated 40 choice tasks, and each respondent completed 1 block of 10 and 2 validity tests. Analysis was by multinomial logistical regression. SETTING: N=21 UK hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: N=325 adult women who were a subsample of those randomised to the single-incision mini-slings clinical trial. OUTCOMES: Patient preferences; valuation obtained using willingness to pay. RESULTS: N=227 of 325 (70%) returned a questionnaire, and 94% of those completed all choice tasks. Respondents preferred general anaesthesia, shorter recovery times, improved stress urinary incontinence symptoms and avoidance of adverse events. Women were willing to pay (mean (95% CI)) £76 (£33 to £119) per day of reduction in recovery time following surgery. They valued increases in Patient Global Impression of Improvement, ranging from £8173 (£5459 to £10 887) for 'improved' to £11 706 (£8267 to £15 144) for 'very much improved' symptoms, compared with no symptom improvement. This was offset by negative values attached to the avoidance of complications ranging between £-8022 (£-10 661 to £-5383) and £-10 632 (£-14 077 to £-7187) compared to no complications. Women valued treatments that reduced the need to avoid daily activities, with willingness to pay ranging from £-967 (£-2199 to £266) for rarely avoiding activities to £-5338 (£-7258 to £-3417) for frequently avoiding daily activities compared with no avoidance. CONCLUSION: This discrete choice experiment demonstrates that patients place considerable value on improvement in stress urinary incontinence symptoms and avoidance of treatment complications. Trade-offs between symptom improvement and adverse event risk should be considered within shared decision-making. The willingness to pay values from this study can be used in future cost-benefit analyses. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN: 93264234; Post-results.",1
Perspectives of people with HIV and HIV clinicians on characteristics of antiretroviral treatment and HIV-related symptoms.,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess HIV symptoms from the perspective of both patients and HIV specialists and the impact of discontinuing antiretroviral treatment (ART) on symptomology. We gathered opinions from HIV specialists and people living with HIV about ideal ART parameters and treatment satisfaction. METHODS: Ex post-facto cross-sectional surveys were administered to 502 people living with HIV and 101 HIV clinicians in Spain (18 sites). RESULTS: The median age of participants with HIV was 43.2 years, 74.5% were male, and 91.6% had an undetectable viral load. The mean time since initiation of ART was 10.2 years. Between 54% and 67% of people living with HIV reported experiencing nervousness or anxiety, sadness, fatigue, sleep problems, or muscle/joint pain during the preceding 4 weeks. However, only 22%-27% of specialists acknowledged the presence of these symptoms. The most bothersome symptoms were related to mental health or the central nervous system. There were significant differences between the burden of symptoms reported by people living with HIV and those acknowledged by specialists. The symptoms that more frequently caused ART discontinuation were depression, dizziness, and sleep problems. Both people living with HIV and specialists prioritized ART efficacy and low toxicity, but their importance ratings differed for 5 of the 11 ART characteristics assessed. People living with HIV rated their satisfaction with ART at a mean (± standard deviation) of 8.9 ± 1.5 out of 10, whereas HIV specialists rated it lower, at 8.3 ± 0.7 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in HIV care and treatment, a large proportion of patients still experience symptoms. HIV specialists may not be fully aware of these. People living with HIV and HIV specialists are, overall, satisfied with ART. However, the importance they place on different ART characteristics may vary.",0
Treatment Preferences of Adolescents and Young Adults with Depressive Symptoms: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Depression in adolescents and young adults is common and causes considerable disease burden while hampering their development, leading to adverse consequences in later life. Although treatment is available, young people are a vulnerable group regarding uptake and completion of treatment. To improve this, insight into youth's preferences for treatment is essential. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate patient preferences for depression treatment in a Dutch sample aged 16-24 years using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). METHODS: The study was conducted in The Netherlands between October 2018 and June 2019, and included 236 adolescents and young adults with current depressive symptoms or previous treatment. The DCE included five attributes (treatment type, frequency of appointment, waiting time, effectiveness, evaluation of therapeutic alliance) with corresponding levels. Results were analysed using latent class analysis. RESULTS: Results show a general preference for individual psychotherapy, treatment with high frequency, high effectiveness, short waiting time and a standard evaluation of the therapeutic alliance ('click' with the therapist) early in treatment. Latent class analysis revealed three different patterns of preferences regarding treatment type and willingness to engage in therapy. The first class showed a strong preference for individual therapy. The second class, including relatively older, higher educated and treatment-experienced participants, preferred high frequency treatment and was more open to different forms of therapy. The third class, including lower educated, younger and treatment-naïve adolescents showed reluctance to engage in therapy overall and in group therapy specifically. CONCLUSION: In this DCE, three classes could be identified that share similar preferences regarding treatment effectiveness, waiting time and evaluation of the therapeutic alliance, but varied considerably in their preference for treatment type (individual, group, or combined psychotherapy) and their willingness to engage. The results from this study may inform mental health care providers and institutions and help optimize professional care for adolescents and young adults with depressive symptoms, improving engagement in this vulnerable group.",1
Logical Inconsistencies with Expected Utility Theory May Align Better with Patient Preferences-A Response to Paulden et al.,.,0
Alternatives to Opioids for Managing Pain.,"The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) revised the definition of pain in 2020 as ""An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage.""  Ongoing or recurring pain for three or more months has been defined as chronic pain by the same organization.  In comparison, acute pain can have an abrupt onset and is usually short-lasting. Chronic pain problems usually manifest initially as acute pain, and many chronic pain conditions are associated with an intermittent acute flare-up of pain. Chronic pain is a widespread health problem, with approximately 100 million people in the United States suffering from chronic pain in 2008. About 13 to 50% of adults in the United Kingdom have been estimated to suffer from chronic pain. This leads to a significant economic toll through direct healthcare costs associated with treatment and lost productivity. The estimated economic burden ranged from $560 to $635 billion in 2010, which is much higher than that of diabetes, cardiac problems, or cancer. The goal of treatment for chronic pain is the reduction of pain intensity and the improvement of function and quality of life. Apart from efficacy, the adverse effects, side-effect profile, economic factors, and patient preference should also be considered during the selection of a treatment modality. Multimodal management has been recommended for chronic pain, including medications, exercises, lifestyle modification, physical therapy, pain psychology, behavioral modalities, interventional pain modalities, and alternative medicine.",0
In the thick of it: A commentary on the strength of evidence for thickened fluids.,"Purpose: The efficacy of thickened fluids for individuals with dysphagia has come under increasing scrutiny among healthcare professionals. This commentary provides a critical appraisal of the research evidence and presents a balanced argument on the benefits and limitations of thickened fluids in dysphagia management. By doing so, we aim to engage the readership to think critically about this controversial topic and make informed, patient-centered decisions regarding the use of thickened fluids in dysphagia management.Result/Conclusion: We argue that, while the research evidence for the use of thickened fluids in dysphagia management continues to grow, perhaps our problem lies in trying to find one pure answer-to thicken or not to thicken. We encourage clinicians to move past arguments about the controversies of thickened fluids and, rather, use the current evidence base, including research evidence, clinical expertise, and patient preferences to support individuals with dysphagia to make informed choices about their oral intake, in the short and long term.",0
A response to Al et al. Trials 2023;24:233.,"In their recent paper, Al and colleagues (Trials 2023;24:233) argue that manipulation of the methods of recruitment using well-known techniques in order to increase enrollment can be ethically acceptable. This brief response challenges that notion as an affront to voluntariness and a devolution of the ethics of human subjects research to the ""ethics"" of the marketplace.",0
Trans-pacific multicenter collaborative study of minimally invasive proximal versus total gastrectomy for proximal gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers.,"BACKGROUND: The current standard operation for proximal gastric and gastroesophageal junction (P/GEJ) cancers with limited esophageal extension is total gastrectomy (TG). TG is associated with impaired appetite and weight loss due to the loss of gastric functions such as production of ghrelin and with anemia due to intrinsic factor loss and vitamin B(12) malabsorption. Theoretically, proximal gastrectomy (PG) can mitigate these problems by preserving gastric function. However, PG with direct esophagogastric reconstruction is associated with severe postoperative reflux, delayed gastric emptying, and poor quality of life (QoL). Minimally invasive PG (MIPG) with antireflux techniques has been increasingly performed by experts but is technically demanding owing to its complexity. Moreover, the actual advantages of MIPG over minimally invasive TG (MITG) with regards to postoperative QoL are unknown. Our overall objective of this study is to determine the short-term QoL benefits of MIPG. Our central hypotheses are that MIPG is safe and that patients have improved appetite after MIPG with effective antireflux techniques, which leads to an overall QoL improvement when compared with MITG. METHODS: Enrollment of a total of 60 patients in this prospective survey-collection study is expected. Procedures (MITG versus MIPG, antireflux techniques for MIPG [double-tract reconstruction versus the double-flap technique]) will be chosen based on surgeon and/or patient preference. Randomization is not considered feasible because patients often have strong preferences regarding MITG and MIPG. The primary outcome is appetite level (reported on a 0-10 scale) at 3 months after surgery. With an expected 30 patients per cohort (MITG versus MIPG), this study will have 80% power to detect a one-point difference in appetite level. Patient-reported outcomes will be longitudinally collected (including questions about appetite and reflux), and specific QoL items, body weight, body mass index and ghrelin, albumin, and hemoglobin levels will be compared. DISCUSSION: Surgeons from the US, Japan, and South Korea formed this collaboration with the agreement that the surgical approach to P/GEJ cancers is an internationally important but controversial topic that requires immediate action. At the completion of the proposed research, our expected outcome is the establishment of the benefit and safety of MIPG. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with Clinical Trials Reporting Program Registration under the registration number NCI-2022-00267 on January 11, 2022, as well as with ClinicalTrials.gov under the registration number NCT05205343 on January 11, 2022.",0
Patients' expectations of and experiences with psychosocial care needs in perioperative nursing: a descriptive study.,"BACKGROUND: Meeting inpatients' psychosocial care needs is essential for their wellbeing, recovery, and positive experiences. This study aimed to describe and compare surgical inpatients' subjective perceptions of the importance of fundamental psychosocial and overall care received. METHODS: A descriptive study with a convenient sample was conducted from September 2019 to April 2020. A total of 194 surgical inpatients from Norway and Denmark answered a perioperative user participation questionnaire on the day of discharge. The questionnaire was previously face- and content validated. The questionnaire assessed patients' sociodemographic characteristics and four dimensions of fundamental care domains: Psychosocial, Relational, Physical, and System level. This study reports the results from the psychosocial domain. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations were used to analyze background information variables. The congruency between participants' expectations of and experiences with psychosocial care is presented. RESULTS: The inpatients expected (and experienced) the healthcare personnel to treat them with respect and dignity, and to be involved and informed throughout their perioperative care. The average ratings regarding these aspects of psychosocial care needs were 72.1-93.8%. There was congruency between patients' perceptions of the subjective importance (SI) of psychosocial fundamental care and their perceived reality (PR) of care. Congruency between high SI and high PR ranged from 59.1 to 92.2%, and congruency between low SI and low PR ranged from 0 to 6.6%. Incongruency between SI and PR varied between 5.9 and 39.6% and was mainly related to higher PR than SI. We found no association between education level, sex, length of stay, age, and patient expectations of or experiences with psychosocial care needs. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical inpatients in Norway and Denmark experience respectful and dignified treatment, and they feel involved and informed in their perioperative care. It is important to include patient perspectives in further research to avoid missed care and disconnection between what patients prefer and what healthcare personnel plan to do. Understanding patient preferences might also lead to less stress and workload for healthcare personnel.",0
Should we choose CT angiography first instead of SPECT/PET first for the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease?,"In patients presenting with chest pain, current guidelines recommend the use of coronary computed tomography angiography and single-photon emission tomography/positron emission tomography, both with equal class 1 indication and level of evidence A. There is no clear recommendation on which test should be used as a first-line test. The choice of the test should be based on individualized clinical risk assessment, patient characteristics, local expertise/availability, and patient preferences. In this context, it is fair to ask which non-invasive imaging test to choose. The debate reproduced in this article answers this question by summarizing the considerations in selecting present state-of-the-art criteria of the right test for the right patient to ensure efficient resource utilization, minimize unnecessary testing, and maximize diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic efficacy.",0
Patient Preferences and Perceptions Concerning Aesthetic Providers and Social Media.,"BACKGROUND: With the rise of social media, aesthetic providers have established a presence on social media. However, there has been little research to evaluate how patients perceive these aesthetic providers and what they desire to see on their professional accounts. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the social media preferences and perceptions of patients who undergo aesthetic procedures. METHODS: A survey was sent to a random sample of US individuals; 651 (32%) identified that they underwent aesthetic procedures. Descriptive statistics were utilized to analyze participants and groups were compared with chi-square analyses. RESULTS: Our sample had a majority of females (57% female, 43% male). An aesthetic medical provider's social media presence had a positive impact on 41% of respondents; a minority of respondents (9%) preferred no social media presence. Fifty-five percent of respondents indicated they would prefer to see a provider with a blue checkmark. With regard to content published, 70% of respondents found it important that a provider show before and after photographs. One-third of respondents indicated they would prefer not to see personal content (n = 236, 36%). CONCLUSIONS: A social media presence is not a strict requirement for success, but 41% of respondents reported a social media presence positively impacted their desire to see the provider as a patient. Patients preferred certain characteristics, such as verification and before and after photographs. Aesthetic providers should take care when determining what content to publish to their social accounts and should consider focusing on educational, promotional, and family/interpersonal content.",0
Beyond MACE: a multidimensional approach to outcomes in clinical trials for older adults with stable ischemic heart disease.,"The global population of older adults is expanding rapidly resulting in a shift towards managing multiple chronic diseases that coexist and may be exacerbated by cardiovascular illness. Stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) is a predominant contributor to morbidity and mortality in the older adult population. Although results from clinical trials demonstrate that chronological age is a predictor of poor health outcomes, the current management approach remains suboptimal due to insufficient representation of older adults in randomized trials and the inadequate consideration for the interaction between biological aging, concurrent geriatric syndromes, and patient preferences. A shift towards a more patient-centered approach is necessary for appropriately and effectively managing SIHD in the older adult population. In this review, we aim to demonstrate the distinctive needs of older adults who prioritize holistic health outcomes like functional capacity, cognitive abilities, mental health, and quality of life alongside the prevention of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes reported in cardiovascular clinical trials. An individualized, patient-centered approach that involves shared decision-making regarding outcome prioritization is needed when any treatment strategy is being considered. By prioritizing patients and addressing their unique needs for successful aging, we can provide more effective care to a patient population that exhibits the highest cardiovascular risks.",0
"Prostate Cancer, Version 4.2023, NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology.","The NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer provide a framework on which to base decisions regarding the workup of patients with prostate cancer, risk stratification and management of localized disease, post-treatment monitoring, and treatment of recurrence and advanced disease. The Guidelines sections included in this article focus on the management of metastatic castration-sensitive disease, nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and metastatic CRPC (mCRPC). Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with treatment intensification is strongly recommended for patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. For patients with nonmetastatic CRPC, ADT is continued with or without the addition of certain secondary hormone therapies depending on prostate-specific antigen doubling time. In the mCRPC setting, ADT is continued with the sequential addition of certain secondary hormone therapies, chemotherapies, immunotherapies, radiopharmaceuticals, and/or targeted therapies. The NCCN Prostate Cancer Panel emphasizes a shared decision-making approach in all disease settings based on patient preferences, prior treatment exposures, the presence or absence of visceral disease, symptoms, and potential side effects.",0
What Do Rheumatology Patients Want in an After-Visit Summary? A Kano Analysis of Patient Preferences.,"BACKGROUND: After-visit summaries (AVS) are patient-specific documents curated by providers to summarize the content of medical encounters. Despite widespread use, little is known about rheumatology patient preferences for AVS content and style. The aims of this quality improvement project are to identify patient preferences and to design a rheumatology-specific AVS, using the Kano method. METHODS: This quality improvement project consists of 4 parts. First, investigators interviewed veterans and clinic staff to derive a list of potential features. Second, a Kano questionnaire assessing satisfaction with the presence or absence of each feature was distributed to veterans. Third, qualitative and quantitative Kano analyses were performed to categorize features as mandatory, performance, attractive, or indifferent. Fourthly, based on these findings, an AVS was drafted and distributed to Veterans with an associated survey to assess satisfaction with content, visual appeal, and readability. RESULTS: Nine physicians, 5 veterans, 5 schedulers, 3 nurses, and 3 medical assistants identified 15 features for inclusion in a Kano-style questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed to 50 Veterans using consecutive sampling. Quantitative Kano analysis demonstrated 4 mandatory, 2 performance, and 3 attractive features that were ultimately included in the AVS; 6 indifferent features were excluded. A postintervention survey of 50 Veterans showed high satisfaction scores in AVS content (4.3/5), visual appeal (4.6/5), and readability (4.4/5). CONCLUSIONS: We developed an AVS that included 9 mandatory, attractive, and performance features, as identified by the Kano method. Veterans were highly satisfied by the content, visual appeal, and readability of the AVS.",0
Australian Patient Preferences for Discussing Spiritual Issues in the Hospital Setting: An Exploratory Mixed Methods Study.,"While there is high patient acceptance for clinical staff discussing issues regarding spirituality with hospital inpatients, it is not clear which staff member patients prefer for these discussions. This unique exploratory study investigated inpatient preferences regarding which staff member should raise the topic of spirituality. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with inpatients at six hospitals in Sydney, Australia (n = 897), with a subset invited to participate in qualitative interviews (n = 41). Pastoral care staff (32.9%) were the preferred staff members with whom to discuss spiritual issues, followed by doctors (22.4%). Qualitative findings indicated that individual characteristics of the staff member are more important than their role.",0
What types of information do pharmacists include in comprehensive medication management review reports? A qualitative content analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Comprehensive medication management reviews are an established intervention to identify medication-related problems, such as the prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications, and under- and over-prescribing. However, the types of information included in written reports of comprehensive medication management reviews, beyond types of medication-related problems, are unknown. AIM: This study aimed to explore the types of information Australian pharmacists include in their written reports following comprehensive medication management reviews. METHOD: Australian consultant pharmacists were invited to upload their 10 most recent written reports of their domiciliary-based comprehensive medication management reviews. A random selection of the reports, stratified by each pharmacist, were included for qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-two de-identified reports from eight consultant pharmacists located in five of the eight Australian States and Territories were included for analysis. From the evaluated reports, four major categories of information were identified: (1) patient details such as date of interview (n = 72, 100%) and medicine history (n = 70, 97%); (2) pharmacist assessment including assessment of the patient (n = 70, 97%), medicines management (n = 68, 94%) and medicine-related issues (n = 60, 83%); (3) pharmacist recommendations, specifically pharmacological recommendations (n = 67, 93%); and (4) patient-centred experiences such as perspectives on medicines (n = 56, 78%). Reporting of patient-centred experiences appeared most variably in the included reports, including patient concerns (n = 38, 53%), willingness for change (n = 27, 38%), patient preferences (n = 13, 18%), and patient goals (n = 7, 10%). CONCLUSION: Pharmacists within our study included a wide variety of information in their comprehensive medication management review reports. Aside from medication-related problems, pharmacists commonly provided a holistic assessment of the patients they care for. However, variability across reports has the potential to impact consistent service delivery.",0
Evaluating the Feasibility of a Community Pharmacy-Delivered Behaviour Change Intervention to Reduce Reliever Reliance in Asthma.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a community pharmacy-delivered intervention to shift patients' beliefs about short-acting beta(2) agonists (SABA) in asthma management. The study targeted individual beliefs about SABA and assessed actual SABA use, focusing on reducing SABA use as well as adherence to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) as a preventive measure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This non-randomized, before-and-after feasibility study enrolled participants with asthma from four community pharmacies in Auckland, New Zealand. Eligible participants were aged 18 years and above and were prescribed a SABA for their asthma. The intervention included the SABA reliance questionnaire to determine the degree of SABA reliance, verbal discussions with pharmacists personalised according to the degree of SABA reliance identified, and referral to general practitioners as appropriate. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients who consented into the study, 19 were in the control group and 16 in the intervention group. Recruitment and retention were modest, with 10 control and five intervention participants completing the 90-day follow-up. Although not statistically significant, preliminary results indicated reduced SABA reliance and increased ICS adherence in the intervention group, and reduced SABA refill. Feedback showed that 78% of intervention participants found the information easy to understand, and 56% expressed intent to consult their general practitioners. Pharmacy staff found the intervention feasible but noted time constraints as a barrier to intervention delivery. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates that a community pharmacy-delivered intervention is feasible and acceptable to both patients and pharmacists. While preliminary results show a positive effect on reducing SABA reliance and improvement of ICS adherence, the results were not statistically significant due to the small numbers recruited. This suggests a larger randomised trial is indicated. This intervention holds promise for addressing the over-reliance on SABA in asthma management and improving adherence to preventive therapies.",0
Evolving therapeutic landscape of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: challenges and aspirations.,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the commonest subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and encompasses a group of diverse disease entities, each harboring unique molecular and clinico-pathological features. The understanding of the molecular landscape of DLBCL has improved significantly over the past decade, highlighting unique genomic subtypes with implications on targeted therapy. At the same time, several new treatment modalities have been recently approved both in the frontline and relapsed settings, ending a dearth of negative clinical trials that plagued the past decade. Despite that, in the real-world setting, issues like drug accessibility, reimbursement policies, physician and patient preference, as well as questions regarding optimal sequencing of treatment options present difficulties and challenges in day-to-day oncology practice. Here, we review the recent advances in the therapeutic armamentarium of DLBCL and discuss implications on the practice landscape, with a particular emphasis on the context of the healthcare system in Singapore.",0
Do Orthopaedic Virtual Clinic Visits Demonstrate Cost and Time Efficiencies Compared With In-person Visits?,"BACKGROUND: There are numerous reasons for the increased use of telemedicine in orthopaedic surgery, one of which is the perception that virtual visits are more cost-effective than in-person visits. However, to our knowledge, no studies have compared the cost and time investment of virtual versus in-person visits using the time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) method. Unlike methods that estimate cost based on charges for services rendered, TDABC provides a more precise measurement of costs, which is essential for assessing cost-effective innovations and moving to value-based healthcare. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Are virtual visits less costly than analogous in-person visits, as measured by TDABC? (2) Does TDABC yield cost estimates that are lower or higher than the ratio of costs to charges (RCC), which is a simple, frequently used costing method? (3) Do the total time commitments of healthcare personnel, and that of the surgeon specifically, vary between the virtual and in-person settings? METHODS: Patients for this prospective, observational study were recruited from the practices of the highest-volume virtual-visit surgeons of three subspecialties (joints, hand, and sports) in a multihospital, tertiary-care academic institution in a metropolitan area in the Midwestern United States. Each surgeon had at least 10 years of clinical practice. Between June 2021 and September 2021, we analyzed both in-person and virtual return visits with patients who had an established relationship with the surgeon, because this represented the most frequent type of virtual visits and enabled a direct comparison between the two settings. New patients were not included in the study because of the limited availability of new-patient virtual visits; such patients often benefit from in-person physical examinations and on-site imaging. Additionally, patients seen for routine postoperative care were excluded because they were primarily seen in person by a physician assistant. Data were acquired during this period until 90 in-person and 90 virtual visits were collected according to selection criteria; no patients were lost to follow-up. Distinct process maps, which represent the steps involved in a clinic visit used to measure healthcare personnel time invested, were constructed for in-person and virtual clinic visits and used to compare total personnel and surgeon time spent. To calculate TDABC-derived costs, time allocated by personnel to complete each step was measured and used to calculate cost based on each personnel member's yearly salary. From the accounting department of our hospital, we acquired RCC cost data according to the level of service for a return visit. RESULTS: The total median cost, as measured by TDABC, was USD 127 (IQR USD 111 to 163) for an in-person visit and USD 140 (IQR USD 113 to 205) for a virtual visit (median difference USD 13; p = 0.16). RCC overestimated TDABC-calculated direct variable cost in five of six service levels (in-person levels 3, 4, and 5 and virtual levels 3 and 5) by a range of USD 25 to 88. Additionally, we found that virtual visits consumed 4 minutes less of total personnel time (in-person: 17 minutes [IQR 13.5 to 23.5 minutes], virtual: 13 minutes [IQR 11 to 19 minutes]; p < 0.001); however, this difference in personnel time did not equate to cost savings because surgeons spent 2 minutes longer on virtual visit activities than they did on in-person activities (in-person: 6 minutes [IQR 4.5 to 9.5 minutes], virtual: 8 minutes [IQR 5.5 to 13 minutes]; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic virtual visits did not deliver cost savings compared with in-person visits because surgeons spent more time on virtual visits and participated in virtual visits at the clinical site. Additionally, as anticipated, RCC overestimated costs as calculated by TDABC. These findings suggest that cost is not a primary advantage of transitioning to virtual visits, and that factors such as patient preference and satisfaction should be considered instead.

Polygenic Risk Prediction in Diverticulitis.,"OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate a polygenic risk score (PRS) to predict the occurrence and severity of diverticulitis and to understand the potential for incorporation of a PRS in current decision-making. BACKGROUND: PRS quantifies genetic variation into a continuous measure of risk. There is a need for improved risk stratification to guide surgical decision-making that could be fulfilled by PRS. It is unknown how surgeons might integrate PRS in decision-making. METHODS: We derived a PRS with 44 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with diverticular disease in the UK Biobank and validated this score in the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI). We performed a discrete choice experiment of practicing colorectal surgeons. Surgeons rated the influence of clinical factors and a hypothetical polygenic risk prediction tool. RESULTS: Among 2812 MGI participants with diverticular disease, 1964 were asymptomatic, 574 had mild disease, and 274 had severe disease. PRS was associated with occurrence and severity. Patients in the highest PRS decile were more likely to have diverticulitis [odds ratio (OR)=1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.42-2.38)] and more likely to have severe diverticulitis (OR=1.61; 95% CI, 1.04-2.51) than the bottom 50%. Among 213 surveyed surgeons, extreme disease-specific factors had the largest utility (3 episodes in the last year, +74.4; percutaneous drain, + 69.4). Factors with strongest influence against surgery included 1 lifetime episode (-63.3), outpatient management (-54.9), and patient preference (-39.6). PRS was predicted to have high utility (+71). CONCLUSIONS: A PRS derived from a large national biobank was externally validated, and found to be associated with the incidence and severity of diverticulitis. Surgeons have clear guidance at clinical extremes, but demonstrate equipoise in intermediate scenarios. Surgeons are receptive to PRS, which may be most useful in marginal clinical situations. Given the current lack of accurate prognostication in recurrent diverticulitis, PRS may provide a novel approach for improving patient counseling and decision-making.",0
Survival and long-term quality-of-life of concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus surgery followed by radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy for the treatment of resectable stage III/IV hypopharyngeal carcinoma.,"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the utility of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) compared to surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (with or without concurrent chemotherapy) (SRT) in terms of improving the life expectancy and quality-of-life (QOL) of patients with stage III/IV hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (HPSCCs). METHODS: From January 2010 to July 2018, a total of 299 patients with stage III/IV HPSCC who received surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (with or without concurrent chemotherapy) (SRT, n = 111), or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT, n = 188) in our hospital were included. We measured overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). We used the EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-H&N35, and Voice handicap index-30 (VHI-30) instruments to assess the long-term QOL. RESULTS: The OS and DFS afforded by SRT were significantly better than those associated with CCRT (p = 0.039; p = 0.048 respectively), especially for stage N2-N3 patients. CCRT patients experienced better speech outcomes. CONCLUSION: For resectable stage III/IV HPSCC patients, appropriate treatment plans should be selected comprehensively considering survival rate, QOL, patient preference and multidisciplinary treatment.",0
How Do We Manage Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in India.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was an ignored leukemia in India until a decade back, given its low prevalence and absence of novel drugs to treat it. Healthcare in India is heterogeneous, with variations in population, health systems, and reimbursement options. We have focused on opinions from three hemato-oncologists incorporating an opinion poll from 44 hemato-oncologists across India on the common issues in CLL to give an idea of the practice pan-India. RECENT FINDINGS: More CLL patients are being diagnosed in their early stages. There is an attempt to use prognostic and predictive markers in making shared decisions for managing CLL. There is still a role for chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) in India, given limited health insurance coverage. But with the availability of inexpensive generics, the patient preference for non-CIT options like Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors is palpable. The CLL scene in India is changing rapidly. With the wide availability of economical generic small molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and coverage by social health insurance schemes, India is poised to cater to most CLL patient needs.",0
Angiosarcoma of the breast: A review.,"Breast angiosarcoma is a rare and highly aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. It can occur spontaneously or be associated with factors such as radiation therapy or chronic lymphedema. The etiology and pathogenesis of this disease are still unclear, the clinical symptoms and imaging findings lack specificity, and the pathological morphology is diverse, which is easy to be confused with other diseases. There is no clear guideline for surgical treatment. Although the optimal surgical approach remains unclear, the ultimate goal is surgical excision with optimal margins, which remains the primary method of treatment. In clinical practice, the choice of the surgical approach should be made by considering the tumor size, pathological type, and patient preferences. In clinical practice, the selection of surgical methods should be carried out with comprehensive consideration of tumor size, pathological types and patients' wishes. There is no clear consensus on whether radiotherapy and chemotherapy should be carried out after surgery, and its optimal program and efficacy are uncertain. This article reviews the etiology, clinical manifestations, pathological features, imaging findings, treatment, prognosis and other aspects of breast angiosarcoma, so as to strengthen clinicians' overall understanding of this disease and avoid missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis.",0
Direct-to-consumer orthodontics: Exploring laypeople's perception of orthodontic treatment complexity.,"BACKGROUND: The authors aimed to explore the treatment preferences of laypeople regarding direct-to-consumer (DTC) orthodontics and to identify whether case complexity, as perceived by laypeople, is one of the factors influencing interest in DTC orthodontics. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted. Data analysis was performed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 1,362 surveys were completed. A significant inverse association was identified between the complexity of an orthodontic case, as measured using the American Board of Orthodontics' discrepancy index (DI) score, and the likelihood of choosing DTC treatment over an orthodontist. Participants were 3.53 times more likely to choose DTC treatment for a mild case (DI score, 0-10) compared with a complex case (DI score, > 20), although the likelihood of choosing DTC treatment for a moderate case (DI score, 11-20) was only 1.79 times higher than for a complex case. CONCLUSIONS: When laypeople were asked to consider each case as if it were their own dentition, there was a significant inverse association between the complexity of an orthodontic case, as measured using the DI score, and the likelihood of choosing DTC treatment over an orthodontist. Laypeople were seemingly more likely to choose DTC orthodontics for dentitions that did not appear crowded and were well aligned within the arches. Laypeople seemed to have an understanding that there are some limitations to DTC orthodontics. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Orthodontists should better understand the factors influencing consumers' decisions to select DTC orthodontics and dental organizations should focus their educational campaigns on these factors.",0
Rate and reasons for peritoneal dialysis dropout following haemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis switch: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Patient experiences and survival outcomes can be influenced by the circumstances related to dialysis initiation and subsequent modality choices. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the rate and reasons for peritoneal dialysis (PD) dropout following haemodialysis (HD) to PD switch. METHOD: This systematic review conducted searches in four databases, including Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (study ID: CRD42023405718). Outcomes included factors leading to the switch from HD to PD, the rate and reasons for PD dropout and mortality difference in two groups (PD first group versus HD to PD group). The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist and the GRADE tool were used to assess quality. RESULTS: 4971 papers were detected, and 13 studies were included. On meta-analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in PD dropout in the PD first group (OR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.61, 1.09; I(2) = 83%; P = 0.16), however, there was a statistically significant reduction in the rate of mortality (OR: 0.48; 95%CI: 0.25, 0.92; I2 = 73%; P = 0.03) compared to the HD to PD group. The primary reasons for HD to PD switch, included vascular access failure, patient preference, social issues, and cardiovascular disease. Causes for PD dropout differed between the two groups, but inadequate dialysis and peritonitis were the main reasons for PD dropout in both groups. CONCLUSION: Compared to the PD first group, a previous HD history may not impact PD dropout rates for patients, but it could impact mortality in the HD to PD group. The reasons for PD dropout differed between the two groups, with no statistical differences. Psychosocial reasons for PD dropout are valuable to further research. Additionally, establishing a consensus on the definition of PD dropout is crucial for future studies.",0
Correlation of an Electronic Geriatric Assessment With Receipt of Adjuvant Radiation and Chemotherapy in Older Adults With Head and Neck Cancer.,"PURPOSE: Treatment patterns for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) vary among older adults because of concerns about their health status. Geriatric assessment may guide treatment for older adults with HNSCC by assessing their health status. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted a retrospective review of adjuvant treatment received by older patients with HNSCC who completed a novel geriatric assessment, the electronic Rapid Fitness Assessment, before treatment. The electronic Rapid Fitness Assessment yields an accumulated geriatric deficits (AGD) score. Higher AGD score indicates greater frailty. Comparators were age and performance status. The Wilcoxon rank sum test compared differences between those who did and did not receive adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy. RESULTS: The cohort included 73 patients, of whom 56 (77%) had oral cavity cancer. The most common geriatric deficits were major distress, social activity limitation, depression, and impaired activities of daily living. AGD score, age, and performance status were not associated with receipt of adjuvant radiation. Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy had a significantly lower median AGD score than those who did not (3 vs 6; P = .044), but there was no association with age and performance status. Of the 17 patients with newly diagnosed disease and either positive margins or extranodal extension, only 9 received adjuvant radiation and only 3 received systemic therapy. Most often, systemic therapy was omitted because of patient preference or comorbidities and poor performance status. There was a nonstatistically significant lower AGD score between patients who did and did not receive standard fractionated radiation therapy (median, 4 vs 6.5; P = .13). CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with frailty. Rates of chemotherapy utilization were very low, indicating the need for novel strategies to mitigate the toxicity burden in this patient population. Receipt of adjuvant radiation therapy was not associated with frailty; however, there was a trend toward lower frailty among those who did receive radiation therapy.",0
Disparities in health utilities among hepatitis C patients receiving care in different settings.,"BACKGROUND: Although chronic hepatitis C (CHC) disproportionately affects marginalized individuals, most health utility studies are conducted in hospital settings which are difficult for marginalized patients to access. We compared health utilities in CHC patients receiving care at hospital-based clinics and socio-economically marginalized CHC patients receiving care through a community-based program. METHODS: We recruited CHC patients from hospital-based clinics at the University Health Network and community-based sites of the Toronto Community Hep C Program, which provides treatment, support, and education to patients who have difficulty accessing mainstream health care. We elicited utilities using six standardized instruments (EuroQol-5D-3L [EQ-5D], Health Utilities Index Mark 2/Mark 3 [HUI2/HUI3], Short Form-6D [SF-6D], time trade-off [TTO], and Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to examine factors associated with differences in health utility. RESULTS: Compared with patients recruited from the hospital setting (n = 190), patients recruited from the community setting (n = 101) had higher unemployment (87% versus 67%), history of injection drug use (88% versus 42%), and history of mental health issue(s) (79% versus 46%). Unadjusted health utilities were lower in community than hospital patients (e.g., EQ-5D: 0.722 [SD 0.209] versus 0.806 [SD 0.195]). Unemployment and a history of mental health issue(s) were significant predictors of low health utility. CONCLUSIONS: Socio-economically marginalized CHC patients have lower health utilities than patients typically represented in the CHC utility literature. Their utilities should be incorporated into future cost-utility analyses to better represent the population living with CHC in health policy decisions.",1
Is it preferable to administer a bronchodilator once- or twice-daily when treating COPD?,"Nocturnal and early morning symptoms are common and uncomfortable in many patients with COPD, and are likely to affect their long-term outcomes. However, it is still debated whether it is better to give long-acting bronchodilators once- or twice-daily to symptomatic COPD patients. The functional link between circadian rhythms of autonomic tone and airway calibre explains why the timing of administration of bronchodilators in chronic airway diseases can induce different effects when taken at different biological (circadian) times. However, the timing also depends on the pharmacological characteristics of the bronchodilator to be used. Because the profile of bronchodilation produced by once-daily vs. twice-daily long-acting bronchodilators differs throughout 24 h, selecting long-acting bronchodilators may be customized to specific patient preferences based on the need for further bronchodilation in the evening. This is especially helpful for people who experience respiratory symptoms at night or early morning. Compared to placebo, evening bronchodilator administration is consistently linked with persistent overnight improvements in dynamic respiratory mechanics and inspiratory neural drive. The current evidence indicates that nocturnal and early morning symptoms control is best handled by a LAMA taken in the evening. In contrast, it seems preferable to use a LABA for daytime symptoms. Therefore, it can be speculated that combining a LAMA with a LABA can improve bronchodilation and control symptoms better. Both LAMA and LABA must be rapid in their onset of action. Aclidinium/formoterol, a twice-daily combination, is the most studies of the available LAMA/LABA combinations in terms of impact on daytime and nocturnal symptoms.",0
Non-pharmacological and nonsurgical interventions in male urinary incontinence: A scoping review.,"AIMS: To describe and synthesize non-pharmacological and nonsurgical interventions for male urinary incontinence from the existing literature. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodology suggested by Arksey and O'Malley: (1) identification of the research questions; (2) identification of relevant studies using a three-step search recommended by JBI: an initial search within PubMed and CINAHL, a comprehensive literature search within PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and literature search of references lists; (3) study selection; (4) data extraction and charting; (5) collation, summarization, and reporting of the results. The PRISMA-ScR Checklist was used to report. RESULTS: A total of 4602 studies were identified, of which 87 studies were included. Approximately 78% were randomized controlled trials. More than 88% of the participants were men with prostate cancer. Exercising pelvic floor muscles 30 times per day for 12 weeks was the most frequently reported. Parameters of electrical stimulation were typically set up to 50 Hz and 300 μs for frequency and width of pulse, respectively, and lasted for 15 min. Pure pelvic floor muscle training, Pilates, Yoga, whole body vibration, diaphragm/abdominal muscle training, micturition interruption exercise, acupuncture, and auriculotherapy showed positive effects on reducing urinary incontinence. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested implementing pelvic floor muscle training alone before or after surgery can both prompt the recovery of continence in men after prostate cancer surgery. The decision to use biofeedback or electrical stimulation to enhance the therapeutic effect of pelvic floor muscle training should be approached with caution. More rigorous designed studies are needed to validate the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine techniques and diverse novel methods. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Physicians and nurses need to be up to date on the latest evidence-based non-pharmacological and nonsurgical interventions in male urinary incontinence and select appropriate interventions based on available medical resources and patient preferences.",0
Real-World Evidence Comparing Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab in Antitumor Necrosis Factor-Experienced Patients With Crohn's Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Many patients with Crohn's disease (CD) lose response or become intolerant to antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy and subsequently switch out of class. We compared the effectiveness and safety of ustekinumab to vedolizumab in a large, geographically diverse US population of TNF-experienced patients with CD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using longitudinal claims data from a large US insurer (Anthem, Inc.). We identified patients with CD initiating vedolizumab or ustekinumab with anti-TNF treatment in the prior 6 months. Our primary outcome was treatment persistence for >52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included (i) all-cause hospitalization, (ii) hospitalization for CD with surgery, (iii) hospitalization for CD without surgery, and (iv) hospitalization for infection. Propensity score fine stratification was used to control for demographic and baseline clinical characteristics and prior treatments. RESULTS: Among 885 new users of ustekinumab and 490 new users of vedolizumab, we observed no difference in treatment persistence (adjusted risk ratio 1.09 [95% confidence interval 0.95-1.25]). Ustekinumab was associated with a lower rate of all-cause hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 0.73 [0.59-0.91]), nonsurgical CD hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 0.58 [0.40-0.83]), and hospitalization for infection (adjusted hazard ratio 0.56 [0.34-0.92]). DISCUSSION: This real-world comparative effectiveness study of anti-TNF-experienced patients with CD initiating vedolizumab or ustekinumab showed similar treatment persistence rates beyond 52 weeks, although secondary outcomes such as all-cause hospitalizations, nonsurgical CD hospitalizations, and hospitalizations for infection favored ustekinumab initiation. We, therefore, advocate for individualized decision making in this medically refractory population, considering patient preference and other factors such as cost and route of administration.",0
Patient and clinician perspectives of a remote monitoring program for COVID-19 and lessons for future programs.,"COVID Watch is a remote patient monitoring program implemented during the pandemic to support home dwelling patients with COVID-19. The program conferred a large survival advantage. We conducted semi-structured interviews of 85 patients and clinicians using COVID Watch to understand how to design such programs even better. Patients and clinicians found COVID Watch to be comforting and beneficial, but both groups desired more clarity about the purpose and timing of enrollment and alternatives to text-messages to adapt to patients' preferences as these may have limited engagement and enrollment among marginalized patient populations. Because inclusiveness and equity are important elements of programmatic success, future programs will need flexible and multi-channel human-to-human communication pathways for complex clinical interactions or for patients who do not desire tech-first approaches.",0
The experience of patients with lung cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic and its importance for post-pandemic outpatient cancer care planning: A cross sectional study exploring the roles of age and frailty.,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the care and experiences of people with cancer, but it presented an opportunity to improve the delivery of outpatient care post-pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an observational cross-sectional study with people with lung cancer throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey investigated patients' experiences and preferences regarding the delivery of cancer care to plan for post-pandemic care, as well as the pandemic's impact on their functional status (physical and psycho-social), exploring the role of age and frailty. RESULTS: Amongst 282 eligible participants, 88%, 86%, and 59% of patients reported feeling appropriately supported during the pandemic by their cancer centre, friends/family, and primary care services, respectively. Remote oncology consultations were delivered to 90% of patients during the pandemic, of which 3% did not meet patients' expectations. Regarding post-pandemic outpatient care preferences, face-to-face appointments were preferred by 93% for the first appointment, by 64% when discussing imaging results, and by 60% for reviews during anti-cancer treatments. Older patients aged 70 years and above were more likely to favour face-to-face appointments (p = 0.007), regardless of their frailty status. Patient preferences changed over time, with the more recent participants preferring remote appointments during anti-cancer treatments (p = 0.0278). Regarding the pandemic's impact, abnormal levels of anxiety and depression were found in 16% and 17% of patients, respectively. Younger patients experienced higher abnormal levels of anxiety and depression (p = 0.036, p = 0.021). Amongst the older sub-group, those with frailty had higher levels of anxiety and depression (p < 0.001). Amongst all participants, 54% reported a considerable negative impact from the pandemic on different aspects of their daily life, particularly emotional and psychological health and sleep patterns, which were more marked in younger patients and the older sub-group with frailty. Older patients without frailty reported the least impact on their functional status. DISCUSSION: There is a need for more personalised outpatient consultation options during cancer care. Whilst there is a preference for face-to-face consultations for older patients, following the pandemic there is a growing acceptance of remote consultations particularly during anti-cancer treatment. Older patients with lung cancer without frailty were less affected by the pandemic than those with frailty and younger patients, requiring less support from healthcare services.",0
Smartphone Application Versus Standard Instruction for Colonoscopic Preparation: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare smartphone application (Colonoscopic Preparation) instructions versus paper instructions for bowel preparation for colonoscopy. BACKGROUND: Adhering to bowel preparation instructions is important to ensure a high-quality colonoscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included individuals undergoing colonoscopy at a tertiary care hospital. Individuals were randomized (1:1) to receive instructions through a smartphone application or traditional paper instructions. The primary outcome was the quality of the bowel preparation as measured by the Boston Bowel Preparation Score. Secondary outcomes included cecal intubation and polyp detection. Patient satisfaction was assessed using a previously developed questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 238 individuals were randomized (n = 119 in each group), with 202 available for the intention-to-treat analysis (N = 97 in the app group and 105 in the paper group). The groups had similar demographics, indications for colonoscopy, and type of bowel preparation. The primary outcome (Boston Bowel Preparation Score) demonstrated no difference between groups (Colonoscopic Preparation app mean: 7.26 vs paper mean: 7.28, P = 0.91). There was no difference in cecal intubation (P = 0.37), at least one polyp detected (P = 0.43), or the mean number of polyps removed (P = 0.11). A higher proportion strongly agreed or agreed that they would use the smartphone app compared with paper instructions (89.4% vs 70.1%, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone instructions performed similarly to traditional paper instructions for those willing to use the application. Local patient preferences need to be considered before making changes in the method of delivery of medical instructions.",0
Development of attributes and attribute levels for a discrete choice experiment on patients' and providers' choice for antiretroviral therapy service in Northwest Ethiopia.,"BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are used to assess the strength of preferences and value of interventions. However, researchers using this approach have been criticized for not conducting or publishing rigorous studies to select the required attributes and levels. Proper specification of attributes and their levels determines the validity of DCE. Hence, our study aimed to identify and define attributes and levels for the design of a DCE to elicit patients' and providers' preferences for ART service in Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: Four stages were followed to derive the final list of attributes and levels: (1) a literature review to derive conceptual attributes; (2) key informant interviews of 17 providers and in-depth interviews of 15 adult stable patients to identify context-specific attributes and attribute levels; (3) ranking survey among 31 HIV/AIDS program implementers and rating survey among 35 adult stable patients and 42 health workers providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) service to indicate participants' preference of attributes; and (4) an expert opinion to reduce the list of attributes and levels. RESULTS: First, a literature review identified 23 candidate attributes. Second, individual-level analysis of the qualitative transcripts confirmed 15 of these 23 attributes. Third, the ranking and rating surveys put the importance of the 23 ART service attributes in order of preference. Fourth, through discussions with eight experts, 17 attributes were discarded based on multiple criteria. The six retained attributes were: the location of ART refills, the frequency of receiving ART refills, the person providing ART refills, the participants/others seen at the same ART refill visit, medication refill pick-up/delivery times, and the total cost of the visit during antiretroviral (ARV) medication refill. Finally, levels were assigned to these 6 attributes based on data from the literature, transcripts, and knowledge of the Ethiopian context. CONCLUSIONS: This detailed description illuminates the attribute development process and provides the reader with a basis for evaluating the rigor of this phase of DCE construction. This paper contributes empirical evidence to the limited methodological literature on attributes and levels of development for DCE, thereby providing further empirical guidance on ART service preference, specifically among patients of low- and middle-income countries.",1
A multidisciplinary consensus statement on the optimal pharmacological treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). The addition of docetaxel or new hormone therapies (abiraterone, apalutamide, or enzalutamide) improves overall survival and is currently the standard of care. However, the decision on the specific regimen to accompany ADT should be discussed with the patient, considering factors such as possible associated toxicities, duration of treatment, comorbidities, patient preferences, as there is no sufficient evidence to recommend one regimen over the other in most cases. This paper summarizes the evidence on the management of mHSPC and provides consensus recommendations on the optimal treatment in combination with ADT in mHSPC patients, with special attention to the patient's clinical profile.",0
Cancer patients' experiences and preferences when receiving bad news: a qualitative study.,"PURPOSE: Receiving a cancer diagnosis significantly impacts patients' lives, and how the bad news is delivered influences patients' trajectory, psychosocial adjustment and openness to psycho-oncological support. We explored how patients' experiences, reactions and preferences were when receiving the news and which optimization recommendations can be made. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study with patients who enrolled in the new integrated cross-sectoral psycho-oncological care programme 'isPO', being enrolled 12 months post-diagnosis. Data on the main issue (i.e. perception of the moment when the diagnosis is received) were collected via telephone interviews that were fully audiotaped and transcribed. Two independent coders conducted inductive content analyses using MAXQDA. RESULTS: Out of 38 approached patients, 23 cancer patients with 13 different tumour entities participated. They had a mean age of 54.2 (SD 16.2); n = 17 (74%) were female. Three major themes with 14 corresponding subthemes emerged: (1) patients' experiences with the bad news delivery, including setting, mode, preparation and perceived needs; (2) patients' reactions to the bad news, such as shock, fear and helplessness, disbelief and denial, anger and feeling of injustice, thankfulness and depression; and (3) patients' receiving preferences, including psycho-oncological support, addressing informational needs, needs-driven comprehensive support and a competent multidisciplinary support team. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of bad news delivery and addressing patients' needs should be strongly considered by physicians. We recommend integrating patients' perspective on the quality management processes of breaking bad news. For providing needs-centred high-quality care, applying existing guidelines and acquiring patient-centred communication skills are central.",0
Colon Capsule Endoscopy - Shining the Light through the Colon.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) is a non-invasive, wireless capsule endoscope. In this article, we review its current applications, compare its performance with optical colonoscopy (OC) and alternative imaging modalities like CT colonography (CTC), and highlight developments that may increase potential future use. RECENT FINDINGS: By comparison to OC both CCE and CTC have a good sensitivity and specificity in detecting colonic polyps. CCE is more sensitive in detecting sub centimetre polyps. CCE is capable of detecting colonic inflammation and anorectal pathologies, commonly missed by CTC. However, rates of complete CCE examinations are limited by inadequate bowel preparation or incomplete colonic transit, whereas CTC can be performed with less bowel purgatives. Patients tolerate CCE better than OC, however patient preference between CCE and CTC vary. CCE and CTC are both reasonable alternatives to OC. Strategies to improve completion rates and adequacy of bowel preparation will improve cost and clinical effectiveness of CCE.",0
Colorectal Cancer Screening and Surveillance in the Geriatric Population.,"PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Our national guidelines regarding screening and surveillance for colorectal cancer recommend individualized discussions with patients 75-85 years of age. This review explores the complex decision-making that surrounds these discussions. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite updated guidelines for colorectal cancer screening and surveillance, the guidance for patients 75 years of age or older remains unchanged. Studies exploring the risks to colonoscopy in this population, patient preferences, life expectancy calculators and additional studies in the subpopulation of inflammatory bowel disease patients provide points of consideration to aid in individualized discussions. The benefit-risk discussion for colorectal cancer screening in patients over 75 years old warrants further guidance to develop best practice. To craft more comprehensive recommendations, additional research with inclusion of such patients is needed.",0
"Objectivity, practicality, and significance of practice guidelines for the practicing neurologists: What we learnt from consensus criteria in CIDP, Myasthenia Gravis and Inflammatory Myopathies.","The value of practice guidelines in the three most common autoimmune neuromuscular disorders, namely Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP), Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and Autoimmune Inflammatory Myopathies (AIM), has been extensively debated regarding their usefulness in clinical practice, objectivity and universal value considering that guidelines are also established regionally in certain countries. This commentary highlights common concerns on how guidelines are presently generated, pointing out: (a) non-sufficient diversity among Task-Force members to identify and address not only routine clinical and electrophysiology issues but also immunology, imaging, pathology, biomarkers, epidemiology or treatment economics; (b) Task-Force being often comprised by the same or seemingly like-minded members conveying the erroneous impression that experts with opposing views might have been excluded, even if this is clearly not the case; and (c) relying on web-based registries or retrospective data collections from heterogeneous sources. As a result, the existing practice guidelines in CIDP, MG and AIM remain an unfinished business but an excellent base for further enhancement. Guidelines can be extremely helpful not only for clinical trials but also in clinical practice if viewed as a living document with continuously updated versions by experts even with opposing views with precise information on diagnostics, pathomechanisms, therapeutic schemes, evolving biomarkers and economics of new therapies with validation of the post-guidelines criteria. Geographic diversity should be taken into consideration because the availability of biomarker testing, and therapies differ among countries. Patient preferences need to be also considered in therapeutic guidelines because newly marketed drugs offer more options steadily changing the therapeutic algorithms in autoimmune neuromuscular diseases generating also questions as to whether they also influence decisions on insurance coverage. Collectively, these startup considerations are aimed to make practice guidelines more objective, widely acceptable worldwide and more practical or easier to follow in clinical practice.",0
Treatment patterns and healthcare costs among patients with psoriasis initiating apremilast or biologics: a retrospective claims database cohort analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare treatment patterns and healthcare costs for patients with psoriasis who initiate apremilast, tumor necrosis factor inhibitor, or interleukin inhibitor. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used Optum Clinformatics(®) Data Mart to identify propensity score-matched patients initiating apremilast, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, or interleukin inhibitors, with 12-month baseline and 24-month follow-up data. Switch, discontinuation, persistence, healthcare resource utilization, and total healthcare costs were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-four-month switch rates were highest for tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (32%), followed by apremilast (21%) then interleukin inhibitors (14%). Mean (SD) per-patient-per-month costs for switchers were lowest for apremilast ($4213 [$2304]), higher for tumor necrosis factor inhibitors ($5274 [$2280]), and highest for interleukin inhibitors ($5539 [$2296]; p < .001), primarily attributable to pharmacy costs: $3466 (apremilast), $4432 (tumor necrosis factor inhibitor), and $4721 (interleukin inhibitor). LIMITATIONS: Psoriasis severity is absent from claims data; cost outcomes may be influenced by more severe psoriasis being more costly. CONCLUSION: Switching psoriasis treatment is common and increases over time. Apremilast initiators had lower switch rates and costs compared with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, despite lower effectiveness reported in previous studies, perhaps indicating patient preference for oral treatment. Additional oral options may be desirable for this population.",0
"Can the General Public Be a Proxy for an ""At-Risk"" Group in a Patient Preference Study? A Disease Prevention Example in Rheumatoid Arthritis.","BACKGROUND: When selecting samples for patient preference studies, it may be difficult or impractical to recruit participants who are eligible for a particular treatment decision. However, a general public sample may not be an appropriate proxy. OBJECTIVE: This study compares preferences for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) preventive treatments between members of the general public and first-degree relatives (FDRs) of confirmed RA patients to assess whether a sample of the general public can be used as a proxy for FDRs. METHODS: Participants were asked to imagine they were experiencing arthralgia and had screening tests indicating a 60% chance of developing RA within 2 yrs. Using a discrete choice experiment, participants were offered a series of choices between no treatment and 2 unlabeled hypothetical treatments to reduce the risk of RA. To assess data quality, time to complete survey sections and comprehension questions were assessed. A random parameter logit model was used to obtain attribute-level estimates, which were used to calculate relative importance, maximum acceptable risk (MAR), and market shares of hypothetical preventive treatments. RESULTS: The FDR sample (n = 298) spent more time completing the survey and performed better on comprehension questions compared with the general public sample (n = 982). The relative importance ranking was similar between the general public and FDR participant samples; however, other relative preference measures involving weights including MARs and market share differed between groups, with FDRs having numerically higher MARs. CONCLUSION: In the context of RA prevention, the general public (average risk) may be a reasonable proxy for a more at-risk sample (FDRs) for overall relative importance ranking but not weights. The rationale for a proxy sample should be clearly justified. HIGHLIGHTS: Participants from the general public were compared to first-degree relatives on their preferences for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) preventive treatments using a discrete choice experiment.Preferences were similar between groups in terms of the most important and least important attributes of preventive treatments, with effectiveness being the most important attribute. However, relative weights differed.Attention to the survey and predicted market shares of hypothetical RA preventive treatments differed between the general public and first-degree relatives.The general public may be a reasonable proxy for an at-risk group for patient preferences ranks but not weights in the disease prevention context; however, care should be taken in sample selection for patient preference studies when choosing nonpatients.",1
Evaluating the impact of interprofessional training wards on patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes: a mixed-methods analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Interprofessional teamwork is pivotal in modern healthcare, prompting the establishment of interprofessional training wards since 1996. While these wards serve as hubs for optimizing healthcare professional collaboration and communication, research into patient outcomes remains notably sparse and geographically limited, predominantly examining patient satisfaction and sparingly exploring other metrics like mortality or self-discharge rates. This study seeks to bridge this gap, comparing patient outcomes in interprofessional training wards and conventional wards under the hypothesis that the former offers no disadvantage to patient outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We explored patient outcomes within an interprofessional student ward called A-STAR at a University Hospital from October 2019 to December 2022. Engaging with patients discharged between May 2021 and April 2022, we utilized digital and paper-based anonymous questionnaires, catering to patient preference, to gather pertinent data. RESULTS: Analysis of outcomes for 1,482 A-STAR (interprofessional student ward) and 5,752 conventional ward patients revealed noteworthy findings. A-STAR patients tended to be younger (59 vs. 61 years, p < 0.01) and more frequently male (73.5% vs. 70.4%, p = 0.025). Vital clinical outcomes, such as discharges against medical advice, complication-driven readmissions, and ICU transfers, were statistically similar between groups, as were mortality rates (1.2% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.468). A-STAR demonstrated high patient satisfaction, underscored by positive reflections on team competence, ward atmosphere, and responsiveness to concerns, emphasizing the value placed on interprofessional collaboration. Patient narratives commended team kindness, lucid explanations, and proactive involvement. DISCUSSION: This data collectively underscores the safety and reliability of patient care within training wards, affirming that patients can trust the care provided in these settings. Patients on the interprofessional ward demonstrated high satisfaction levels: 96.7% appreciated the atmosphere and conduct of ward rounds. In comparison, 98.3% were satisfied with the discussion and information about their treatment during their hospital stay.",0
'CROSS'-ing into the 'Real World': a retrospective cohort study of patients receiving trimodality and bimodality therapy for esophageal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: A standard of care for nonmetastatic esophageal cancer is trimodality therapy consisting of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and esophagectomy, with evidence for improved overall survival versus surgery alone in the ChemoRadiotherapy for Oesophageal cancer followed by Surgery Study (CROSS) trial. Patients who receive treatment with curative intent but are poor candidates for or decline surgery receive definitive bimodality therapy. Literature characterizing patients who receive bimodality therapy compared to trimodality therapy, and their relative outcomes, is sparse, especially among patients who are too old or too frail to qualify for clinical trials. In this study, we assess a single-institution real-world dataset of patients receiving bimodality and trimodality management. METHODS: Patients treated for clinically resectable, nonmetastatic esophageal cancer between 2009 and 2019 who received bimodality or trimodality therapy were reviewed, generating a dataset of 95 patients. Clinical variables and patient characteristics were assessed for association with modality on multivariable logistic regression. Overall, relapse-free, and disease-free survival were assessed with Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional modeling. For patients nonadherent to planned esophagectomy, reasons for nonadherence were recorded. RESULTS: Bimodality therapy was associated with greater age-adjusted comorbidity index, worse performance status, higher N-stage, presenting symptom other than dysphagia, and held chemotherapy cycles on multivariable analysis. Compared to bimodality therapy, trimodality therapy was associated with higher overall (3-year: 62% vs. 18%, P<0.001), relapse-free (3-year: 71% vs. 18%, P<0.001), and disease-free (3-year: 58% vs. 12%, P<0.001) survival. Similar results were observed among patients who did not meet CROSS trial qualifying criteria. Only treatment modality was associated with overall survival after adjusting for covariates (HR 0.37, P<0.001, reference group: bimodality). Patient choice accounted for 40% of surgery nonadherence in our population. CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving trimodality therapy were observed to have superior overall survival compared to bimodality therapy. Patient preference for organ-preserving therapies appears to impact resection rate; further characterization of patient decision-making may be helpful. Our results suggest patients who wish to prioritize overall survival should be encouraged to pursue trimodality therapy and obtain early consultation with surgery. Development of evidence-based interventions to physiologically prepare patients before and during neoadjuvant therapy as well as efforts to optimize the tolerability of the chemoradiation plan are warranted.",0
Racial Disparity in Tympanostomy Tube Placement in Inpatient Pediatric Admissions.,"This study aims to evaluate if race and ethnicity affect rates of tympanostomy tube (TT) placement during inpatient pediatric admissions in children with otologic conditions. A review of the 2016 Kids' Inpatient Database was conducted based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes for common otologic conditions. Among 85 827 weighted pediatric inpatient discharges with ICD-10-CM codes for common otologic conditions, 213 underwent TT placement. Odds ratios (ORs) for children of Hispanic ethnicity and Asian or Pacific Islander race undergoing TT placement when compared to other ethnicities and races were 0.60 (P = .011) and 0.21 (P = .040), respectively. Multiple logistic regression showed Hispanic ethnicity was associated with lower rates of TT placement when compared to non-Hispanic white children (OR = 0.62; 95% confidence interval = 0.40-0.96). Future studies should assess why these differences exist and if these differences are associated with racial/ethnic bias or attributed to patient/family preference.",0
Differences in Preferences for Drug Therapy Between Patients with Metastatic Versus Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Systematic Literature Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Compared with early stages (eBC) metastatic BC (mBC) is incurable. In mBC, aggressive treatment may increase the duration of survival but may also cause severe treatment side effects. A better understanding how patients with BC value different aspects of drug therapy might improve treatment effectiveness, satisfaction and adherence. This systematic review aims to identify and summarise studies evaluating patient preferences for drug therapy of BC and to compare preferences of patients with eBC and mBC. METHODS: The systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The electronic databases PubMed and Web of Science were searched on 22 June 2023. All studies published to this point were considered. Original studies reporting patient preferences on BC drug therapy determined by any type of choice experiment were eligible. A narrative synthesis of the effect measures presented as relative importance ratings, trade-offs (required benefit to make a therapy worthwhile) or monetary values of the treatment attributes was reported for each study. Risk of bias assessment for individual studies was performed using the checklist for observational studies from the STROBE Statement and the checklist from 'Conducting Discrete Choice Experiments to Inform Healthcare Decision Making: A User's Guide'. The study protocol was registered at the PROSPERO database (CRD42022377031). RESULTS: A total of 34 studies met the inclusion criteria were included in the analysis evaluating the preferences of patients with eBC (n = 18), mBC (n = 10) or any stage BC (n = 6) on, for example, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, hormonal therapy or CKD4/6-inhibitors using different types of choice experiments. Regardless of the stage, most patients valued treatment effectiveness in terms of survival gains higher than potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Treatment cost, mode of administration, treatment regimen and monitoring aspects were considered as least important treatment attributes. In addition, preferences concerning 16 different types of ADRs were described, showing high heterogeneity within BC stages. Yet, comparable results across BC stages were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the stage, patients with BC consistently valued survival gains as the most important attribute and were willing to accept the risk of potential ADRs. Incorporating patient preferences in shared decision making may improve the effectiveness of interventions by enhancing adherence to drug therapy in patients suffering from BC.",1
Shared decision making in patients with substance use disorders: A one-year follow-up study.,"Patient-centered care in therapeutic processes has been associated with better clinical outcomes, however, it remains a poorly studied aspect in Substance Use Disorder (SUD). The study aimed to evaluate patient's preferences, perceived participation in treatment decisions and activation level; and how they predict retention, pharmacological adherence and substance use during one-year follow-up. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between independent variables, along with a wide number of sociodemographic and clinical covariates, and outcomes. Most patients prefer a shared or passive role when making decisions about their treatment, and showed concordance between their preferred and perceived roles. In the univariate models, perceiving more involvement than desired showed a higher likelihood of treatment discontinuation at 12 months, and substance use at 6 and 12 months. No significant associations were found between the remaining decisional variables or the degree of activation with the assessed outcomes. A majority of SUD patients prefer and perceive to be involved in the decision-making process about their treatment. Patients perceiving more involvement than desired might experience an excess of responsibility that could negatively influence treatment continuation and substance use. Limitations of the study preclude any definitive conclusion, and more research is needed to confirm these results.",0
Patient's preferences: an unmet need by current urolithiasis guidelines: a systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION: Shared decision making (SDM) in surgical specialties was demonstrated to diminish decisional regret, decisional anxiety and decisional conflict. Urolithiasis guidelines do not explicit patient preference to choose treatment. The aim of this review article was to perform a systematic evaluation of published evidence regarding SDM in urinary stone treatment. METHODS: A systematic review in accordance PRISMA checklist was conducted using the MEDLINE (PubMed) database. Inclusion criteria were studies that evaluated stone treatment preferences. Reviews, editorials, case reports and video abstracts were excluded. ROBUST checklist was used to assess quality of the studies. RESULTS: 188 articles were obtained. After applying the predefined selection criteria, seven articles were included for final analysis. Six out of seven studies were questionnaires that propose clinical scenarios and treatment alternatives. The last study was a patient preference trial. A general trend among included studies showed a patient preference towards the least invasive option (SWL over URS). The main reasons to choose one treatment over the other were stone-free rates, risk of complications and invasiveness. DISCUSSION: This review provides an overview of the patients' preferences towards stone treatment in small- and medium-sized stones. There was a clear preference towards the least invasive management strategy. The main reason was less invasiveness. This is opposed to the global trends of performing more ureteroscopies and less SWL. Physicians played a pivotal role in counselling patients. SDM should be encouraged and improved. The main limitation of this study is the characteristics of the included studies.",1
Treatment preferences towards thrombopoietin-receptor agonists for immune thrombocytopenia and experience of disease (TRAPeze): Italy cohort.,"OBJECTIVE: Identify patient preference towards thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) and determine the clinical and social impact of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in Italy. METHODS: The Thrombopoietin-Receptor Agonist Patient experience (TRAPeze) survey collected responses from Italian residents from 17th January to 28th February 2022. TRAPeze utilized a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit patient preferences towards TPO-RA attributes and a patient burden survey (PBS) to determine ITP disease characteristics and social impact. RESULTS: Seventy-six respondents completed the DCE, of which 69 completed both the DCE and PBS (mean [range] age 45 [18.0-73.0] years, 80% female). TPO-RA attributes with the greatest influence over respondent choice were method of administration (odds ratio [OR] 2.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.16-4.06), drug-food interactions (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.17-1.86) and frequency of dosing (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.15-1.52). Respondents were more likely to prefer therapies administered orally over subcutaneous injection (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.51-5.63), once weekly over once daily (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.26-2.65), and therapies without food restrictions over with restrictions (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.17-2.14).The most frequently reported symptoms were bruising (82%), petechiae (65%) and fatigue (64%). Most respondents (84%) felt ITP impacted familial relationships and 71% of employed respondents reported fatigue influencing their ability to work, with 31% reducing working hours. CONCLUSION: Although responses indicated a moderate perception of general health, ITP clearly impacted respondent work and social life. Our findings demonstrate respondents preferred TPO-RAs delivered orally, with less frequent dosing and without food restrictions.",1
How Physicians Tackle Internet-Misinformed Patients: Going Beyond Traditional Patient-Centered Communication - A Study Protocol.,"BACKGROUND: The proliferation of misleading and irrelevant health information on the Internet has become a significant public concern. Inappropriate use of online materials can cause harm to patients' health and quality of life. While close attention has been paid to health campaigns and education programs that aim to disseminate accurate health knowledge, the role of physicians, who directly communicate with patients in medical encounters and provide personalized information, has been overlooked. Therefore, this study focuses on physicians and their communication strategies with internet-misinformed patients (IMPs). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the communicative strategies physicians use to tackle IMPs and explore connections between physicians' communicative strategies and patient-centered communication. METHODS: Approximately 10 to 15 physicians from diverse cultural backgrounds, including Ticino (an Italian-speaking region in Switzerland), Milan and China will be interviewed. Interviews will be conducted in-person or online through video conferencing software programs. Physicians will be asked about their experiences with IMPs, communicative strategies for addressing patients' misconceptions, balancing patient preferences, decision-making obstacles, and envisioning an ideal relationship with them. A thematic analysis will be utilized to analyze data, employing a general inductive approach. DISCUSSION: The results will provide valuable insights into effective clinical communication strategies that address patients' misuse of internet materials and inform policymakers and healthcare providers about the limitations and applicability of patient-centered communication in the current digital era.",0
Cancer Patients' Preferences and Perceptions of Advantages and Disadvantages of Telehealth Visits During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"PURPOSE: We aimed to ascertain oncology patients' perceptions of telehealth versus in-person (IP) visits for different types of clinical encounters. METHODS: We surveyed adults undergoing cancer treatment at Kaiser Permanente Northern California infusion centers between November 2021 and May 2022 using a self-administered questionnaire. Patients were asked about visit modality preferences (video, phone, and IP) for six types of clinical discussions, overall advantages and disadvantages of telehealth (video or phone) versus IP modalities, and barriers to video visit use. RESULTS: The 839 patients who completed surveys in English were 63% female; median age 63 years; 64% White; and 73% college-educated (45% ≥bachelor's degree). For the first postdiagnosis discussion visit, 83% of patients preferred IP, followed by video (27%) and phone (18%). For follow-up visits, 52% of patients preferred IP, 50% video, and 37% phone. For discussions of bad news and sensitive topics, respectively, 68% and 62% preferred IP, 44% and 48% video, and 32% and 41% phone visits. Delivery of good news was acceptable through IP (49%), video (52%), or phone (49%) visits. Perceived advantages of IP visits were greater feelings of connection with their doctor (58%), confidence in physical examinations (73%), and ease in showing things (67%) and talking (51%) to the doctor. Advantages of telehealth visits included saved time (72%) and money (38%), less infection exposure (64%), less travel concerns (45%), and ability to include more people (28%). Of 24% of patients who felt video visits would be hard, 51% cited poor internet, 41% lack of an adequate device, and 28% difficulty signing on. CONCLUSION: Our results support continued use and reimbursement for telehealth visits with patients with cancer for most types of clinical encounters, including clinical trials.",0
How should respiratory depression and loss of airway patency be handled during initiation of palliative sedation?,BACKGROUND: Loss of airway patency has been reported during initiation of palliative sedation. In present guidelines the loss of airway patency during initiation of palliative sedation is not addressed. Airway patency can be restored by jaw thrust/chin lift or placing the patient in the recovery position. AIM: A structured ethical analysis of how respiratory depression and loss of airway patency during initiation of palliative sedation should be handled. The essence of the dilemma is whether it is appropriate to apply simple non-invasive methods to restore airway patency in order to avoid the patient's immediate death. DESIGN: A structured analysis based on the four principles of healthcare ethics and stakeholders' interests. RESULTS: Beneficence and autonomy support a decision not to regain airway patency whereas non-maleficence lends weight to a decision to restore airway patency. Whether the proportionality criterion of the principle of double effect is met depends on the features of the individual case. The ethical problem appears to be a genuine dilemma where important values and arguments point to different conclusions. CONCLUSION: Whether to restore airway patency when the airway is obstructed during initiation of palliative sedation will ultimately be based on clinical judgment taking into account both any known patient preferences and relevant clinical information. There are strong arguments favoring both options in this clinical and ethical dilemma. The fact that a clear and universal recommendation cannot be made does not imply indifference regarding what is the clinically and ethically best option for each individual patient.,0
Beyond satisfaction in person-centered pharmacy services.,"Patient self-reported satisfaction is commonly used as an assessment of service experience and quality for community pharmacy services. This commentary discusses alternative foundational approaches to evaluating service experience and quality in patient-centered care. It describes historical and recent literature pertaining to the development and use of satisfaction measures for service design and patient experience assessment. It then highlights potential limitations of patient satisfaction as an assessment tool for patient-centeredness and patient experience identified in the pharmacy literature, which include criticisms that use of patient satisfaction may compromise accuracy in measuring quality due to factors such as patients having poor knowledge of and low expectations for quality and having a predisposition toward rating satisfaction highly when experiencing no-cost and/or unfamiliar services. Moreover, satisfaction measurements may change based on service exposure, with patient preferences for service offerings changing with increased service exposure and variation in patient-specific and environmental factors. After discussing limitations and criticism of patient self-reported satisfaction, we introduce alternative assessments methods which may facilitate more accurate assessments of patient experience and patient-centered pharmacy services such as patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs), patient-reported experience measures (PREMs), and human-centered design techniques such as journey mapping, prototyping, and user testing to design and assess patient-centered pharmacy services. These alternative assessments are rooted in, or related to preferred implementation science approaches to establishing, evaluating, and sustaining pharmacy services.",0
Supporting the Safe Use of the Dorsogluteal Intramuscular Injection Site: An Evidence-Based Quality Improvement Project.,"INTRODUCTION: Administering intramuscular (IM) injections is common in the adult mental health patient care setting, using the deltoid, vastus lateralis, ventrogluteal, or dorsogluteal site. Mental health nurses frequently use the dorsogluteal site to administer short and long-acting IM injections as specified in the drug package insert or because of patient agitation. However, the site is often not recommended due to the potential risk of nerve injury. AIMS: Aims of this evidence-based quality improvement project were to (1) determine the best evidence for supporting the safe use of the dorsogluteal site for short and long-acting IM injections and (2) implement this evidence through nurse education. METHOD: This project had two phases: Determining best evidence through an integrative literature review and implementing the recommendations to use the dorsogluteal site when directed by the drug package insert, clinical need, nursing judgment, or patient preference. Implementation followed the Plan-Do-Study-Act quality improvement process and involved written resources and simulation. RESULTS: Evidence supported the use of the dorsogluteal site in four instances and the importance of education. Nurses were highly satisfied with the education and opportunity to practice their skills with feedback during return demonstration. After studying nurses' follow-up survey results, a refresher simulation and medical center guideline were completed. There were no reports of IM injection patient injuries after 2 years and approximately 768 dorsogluteal and ventrogluteal IM injections in the academic medical center. CONCLUSION: Pursuing recent and possibly overlooked evidence provided guidance in supporting the safe use of the dorsogluteal site for IM injections.",0
Describing settings of care in the last 100 days of life for cancer decedents: a population-based descriptive study.,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have described the settings cancer decedents spend their end-of-life stage, with none considering homecare specifically. We describe the different settings of care experienced in the last 100 days of life by individuals with cancer and how settings of care change as they approached death. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study from January 2013 to December 2017, of decedents whose primary cause of death was cancer, using linked population-level health administrative datasets in Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: Decedents 125,755 were included in our cohort. The average age at death was 73, 46% were female, and 14% resided in rural regions. And 24% died of lung cancer, 7% breast, 7% colorectal, 7% pancreatic, 5% prostate, and 50% other cancers. In the last 100 days of life, decedents spent 25.9 days in institutions, 25.8 days receiving care in the community, and 48.3 days at home without any care. Individuals who died of lung and pancreatic cancers spent the most days at home without any care (52.1 and 52.6 days), while individuals who died of prostate and breast cancer spent the least days at home without any care (41.6 and 45.1 days). Regardless of cancer type, decedents spent fewer days at home and more days in institutions as they approached death, despite established patient preferences for an end-of-life experience at home. CONCLUSIONS: In the last 100 days of life, cancer decedents spent most of their time in either institutions or at home without any care. Improving homecare services during the end-of-life may provide people dying of cancer with a preferred dying experience.",0
"Understanding Patient Perspectives on Specialized, Longitudinal, Postpartum, Cardiovascular Risk-Reduction Clinics.","BACKGROUND: Females who experience hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) have an increased lifelong risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, Canadian clinical practice guidelines recommend cardiovascular risk reduction follow-up after a patient has HDP. This study examined the experiences of patients with HDP who attended a specialized, longitudinal general internal medicine postpartum cardiovascular risk reduction clinic called PreVASC. PreVASC focuses on comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction through cardiovascular risk factor screening and management tailored specifically for female patients after they have HDP. METHODS: This multimethod study examined the experiences of female patients with HDP via the following: (i) a quantitative survey (summarized with descriptive statistics); (ii) semistructured qualitative patient phone interviews (results grouped thematically); and (iii) triangulation of qualitative themes with quantitative survey results. RESULTS: Overall, 37% of eligible clinic patients (42 of 115) participated; 79% of participants (n = 33) reported being ""very satisfied"" with the PreVASC clinic's specialized longitudinal model of care, and 95% (n = 40) reported making at least one preventive health behaviour change after receiving individualized counselling on cardiovascular risk reduction. Qualitative results found improvements in patient-reported cardiovascular health knowledge, health behaviours, and health-related anxiety. A preference for in-person vs phone clinic visits was reported by participants. CONCLUSIONS: An in-person, general internal medicine specialist-led, longitudinal model of cardiovascular disease preventive care focused specifically on cardiovascular risk reduction after HDP had positive impacts on patient experience, health knowledge, and preventive health behaviours. This novel knowledge on patient preferences for a longitudinal, specialized model of care advances cardiovascular risk reduction tailored specifically for high-risk people after HDP.",0
Urethral Bulking With Polyacrylamide Hydrogel Compared With Other Treatments for Stress Urinary Incontinence: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.,"Our objective was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing polyacrylamide hydrogel urethral bulking with other surgical and nonsurgical treatments for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). We created a cost-effectiveness analysis using TreeAge Pro, modeling eight SUI treatments. Treatment with midurethral sling (MUS) had the highest effectiveness (1.86 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), followed by polyacrylamide hydrogel (1.82 QALYs), with a difference (Δ 0.02/year) less than the minimally important difference for utilities of 0.03 annually. When the proportion of polyacrylamide hydrogel urethral bulking procedures performed in the office setting is greater than 58%, polyacrylamide hydrogel is a cost-effective treatment for SUI, along with pessary, pelvic floor physical therapy, and MUS. Although MUS is more effective and, therefore, the preferred SUI treatment, polyacrylamide hydrogel is a reasonable alternative depending on patient preferences and treatment goals.",0
Physical Activity Preferences of People Living with Brain Injury: Formative Qualitative Research to Develop a Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization physical activity guidelines for people living with disability do not consider the needs of people living with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury. This paper describes the qualitative co-development of a discrete choice experiment survey to inform the adaption of these guidelines by identifying the physical activity preferences of people living with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury in Australia. METHODS: The research team comprised researchers, people with lived experience of traumatic brain injury and health professionals with expertise in traumatic brain injury. We followed a four-stage process: (1) identification of key constructs and initial expression of attributes, (2) critique and refinement of attributes, (3) prioritisation of attributes and refinement of levels and (4) testing and refining language, format and comprehensibility. Data collection included deliberative dialogue, focus groups and think-aloud interviews with 22 purposively sampled people living with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury. Strategies were used to support inclusive participation. Analysis employed qualitative description and framework methods. RESULTS: This formative process resulted in discarding, merging, renaming and reconceptualising attributes and levels. Attributes were reduced from an initial list of 17 to six: (1) Type of activity, (2) Out-of-pocket cost, (3) Travel time, (4) Who with, (5) Facilitated by and (6) Accessibility of setting. Confusing terminology and cumbersome features of the survey instrument were also revised. Challenges included purposive recruitment, reducing diverse stakeholder views to a few attributes, finding the right language and navigating the complexity of discrete choice experiment scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: This formative co-development process significantly improved the relevance and comprehensibility of the discrete choice experiment survey tool. This process may be applicable in other discrete choice experiment studies.",1
Roadmap for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension in the Middle East: Review of the 2022 EVIDENT Summit.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension are leading risk factors for death and disability in the Middle East. Both conditions are highly prevalent, underdiagnosed and poorly controlled, highlighting an urgent need for a roadmap to overcome the barriers to optimal glycaemic and blood pressure management in this region. This review provides a summary of the Evidence in Diabetes and Hypertension Summit (EVIDENT) held in September 2022, which discussed current treatment guidelines, unmet clinical needs and strategies to improve treatment outcomes for patients with T2DM and hypertension in the Middle East. Current clinical guidelines recommend strict glycaemic and blood pressure targets, presenting several treatment options to achieve and maintain these targets and prevent complications. However, treatment targets are infrequently met in the Middle East, largely due to high clinical inertia among physicians and low medication adherence among patients. To address these challenges, clinical guidelines now provide individualised therapy recommendations based on drug profiles, patient preferences and management priorities. Efforts to improve the early detection of prediabetes, T2DM screening and intensive, early glucose control will minimise long-term complications. Physicians can use the T2DM Oral Agents Fact Checking programme to help navigate the wide range of treatment options and guide clinical decision-making. Sulfonylurea agents have been used successfully to manage T2DM; a newer agent, gliclazide MR (modified release formulation), has the advantages of a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia with no risk of cardiovascular events, weight neutrality and proven renal benefits. For patients with hypertension, single-pill combinations have been developed to improve efficacy and reduce treatment burden. In conjunction with pragmatic treatment algorithms and personalised therapies, greater investments in disease prevention, public awareness, training of healthcare providers, patient education, government policies and research are needed to improve the quality of care of patients with T2DM and/or hypertension in the Middle East.",0
"Clinical practice guidelines of the Japan Research Committee of the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare for Intractable Vasculitis for the management of microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis: The 2023 update - secondary publica","OBJECTIVE: To revise the 2017 clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) to reflect advancements in the field. METHODS: Similar to the 2017 CPG, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was adopted for this revision. The intended users of this CPG include patients diagnosed with MPA or GPA in Japan and their families and healthcare professionals, including specialists and non-specialists. Based on a scoping review, four clinical questions (CQs) of the 2017 guidelines were modified, and six new CQs were added. RESULTS: We suggest a combination of glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide or rituximab for remission induction therapy. In cases where cyclophosphamide or rituximab is used, we suggest the use of avacopan over high-dose glucocorticoid. Furthermore, we suggest against the use of plasma exchange in addition to the standard treatment in severe cases of MPA/GPA. Finally, we suggest the use of glucocorticoid and rituximab over glucocorticoid and azathioprine for remission maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations have been updated based on patient preference, certainty of evidence, benefit and risk balance, and cost.",0
What landscape elements are needed for hospital healing spaces? Evidence from an empirical study of 10 compact hospitals.,"BACKGROUND: Modern medical research shows that a rationally planned landscape environment helps patients recover. With the growing number of hospital patients and the tightening of per capita medical landscape land, the use of limited landscape resources to serve patients has become challenging. METHODS: This study focused on the landscape environment of 10 hospitals in Guangdong Province, China. Based on the KANO theoretical model, a survey questionnaire was designed and administered to 410 participants. The data were analyzed based on demand attributes, importance, sensitivity, and group differences. RESULTS: The maintenance requirements were the most important item in the sensitivity ranking. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that the users need a safe, quiet, and private environment, owing to their higher requirements, including visual healing, rehabilitation activities, shading and heat preservation, and medical escort. Moreover, adolescents and older adult patients have common and contradictory environmental needs. For example, the landscape environment should provide both an active space and a quiet rehabilitation environment. CONCLUSION: This study evaluates how landscape resources can be better utilized from the perspective of the user and expands the theory of healing landscapes, which has practical implications for hospital renovation and landscape environment strategies.",0
Balancing benefits and risks in lung cancer therapies: patient preferences for lung cancer treatment alternatives.,"BACKGROUND: In the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) the combination of Immuno- Oncotherapy (IO) and chemotherapy (CT) has been found to be superior to IO or CT alone for patients' survival. Patients and clinicians are confronted with a preference sensitive choice between a more aggressive treatment with a greater negative effect on quality of life versus alternatives that are less effective but have fewer side effects. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to: (a) quantify patients' preferences for relevant attributes related to Immuno-Oncotherapy treatment alternatives, and (b) evaluate the maximum acceptable risk (MAR)/Minimum acceptable benefit (MAB) that patients would accept for treatment alternatives. METHODS: An online preference survey using discrete-choice experiment (DCE) was completed by NSCLC patients from two hospitals in Italy and Belgium. The survey asked patients' preferences for five patient- relevant treatment attributes. The DCE was developed using a Bayesian D-efficient design. DCE analyses were performed using mixed logit models. Information regarding patient demographics, health literacy, locus of control, and quality of life was also collected. RESULTS: 307 patients (158 Italian, 149 Belgian), stage I to IV, completed the survey. Patients preferred treatments with a higher 5-year survival chance as the most important attribute over all the other attributes. Preference heterogeneity for the attribute weights depended on health literacy, patients' age and locus of control. Patients were willing to accept a substantially increased risks of developing side effects in exchange for the slightest increase (1%) in the chance of surviving at least 5 years from the diagnosis of cancer. Similarly, patients were willing to accept a switch in the mode of administration or complete loss of hair to obtain an increase in survival. CONCLUSION: In this study, the proportion of respondents who systematically preferred survival over all other treatment attributes was particularly high. Age, objective health literacy and locus of control accounted for heterogeneity in patients' preferences. Evidence on how NSCLC patients trade between survival and other NSCLC attributes can support regulators and other stakeholders on assessing clinical trial evidence and protocols, based on patients' conditions and socio-demographic parameters.",1
Citizen attitudes to non-treatment decision making: a Norwegian survey.,"BACKGROUND: Decisions about appropriate treatment at the end of life are common in modern healthcare. Non-treatment decisions (NTDs), comprising both withdrawal and withholding of (potentially) life-prolonging treatment are in principle accepted in Norway. However, in practice they may give rise to significant moral problems for health professionals, patients and next of kin. Here, patient values must be considered. It is relevant to study the moral views and intuitions of the general population on NTDs and special areas of contention such as the role of next of kin in decision-making. METHODS: Electronic survey to members of a nationally representative panel of Norwegian adults. Respondents were presented with vignettes describing patients with disorders of consciousness, dementia, and cancer where patient preferences varied. Respondents answered ten questions about the acceptability of non-treatment decision making and the role of next of kin. RESULTS: We received 1035 complete responses (response rate 40.7%). A large majority, 88%, supported the right of competent patients to refuse treatment in general. When an NTD was in line with the patient's previously expressed preferences, more respondents tended to find NTDs acceptable. More respondents would accept NTDs for themselves than for the vignette patients. In a scenario with an incompetent patient, clear majorities wanted the views of next of kin to be given some but not decisive weight, and more weight if concordant with the patient's wishes. There were, however, large variations in the respondents' views. CONCLUSION: This survey of a representative sample of the Norwegian adult population indicates that attitudes to NTDs are often in line with national laws and guidelines. However, the high variance among the respondents and relatively large weight given to next of kin's views, indicate a need for appropriate dialogue among all stakeholders to prevent conflicts and extra burdens. Furthermore, the emphasis given to previously expressed opinions indicates that advance care planning may increase the legitimacy of NTDs and prevent challenging decision-making processes.",0
Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection Versus Surgery or Endoscopic Mucosal Resection for Metachronous Early Gastric Cancer: a Meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Resection options for early gastric cancer (EGC) include endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), and surgery. In patients with metachronous EGC following previous resection, the optimal resection technique is not well elucidated. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing ESD to EMR, or ESD to surgery, in patients with metachronous EGC. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of studies reporting on outcomes and AEs following ESD versus either EMR or surgery for patients with metachronous EGC. Pooled odds ratios (OR) of included studies were obtained using DerSimonian and Laird random effects models. Funnel plots were produced and visually inspected for evidence of publication bias. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS: A total of 9367 abstracts were screened and 10 observational studies were included. The odds of complete resection were higher amongst patients undergoing ESD compared to EMR (OR 5.88, 95% confidence intervals, CI, 1.79-19.35), whereas the odds of complete resection were no different between ESD and surgery (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.04-8.24). There were no differences in the odds of local recurrence with ESD versus surgery (OR 5.01, 95% CI 0.86-29.13). Post-procedural bleeding did not differ significantly between ESD and EMR (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.16-3.00). There was no evidence of publication bias. DISCUSSION: For metachronous EGC, ESD or surgery is preferred over EMR depending on local expertise and patient preferences, largely due to a higher risk of incomplete resection with EMR.

Investigation of predictors influencing patient-pharmacist relationship establishment.,"BACKGROUND: A strong patient-pharmacist relationship is tied to patients' trust and confidence in pharmacists and pharmacy services. While past research has described patient-pharmacist relationship archetypes (i.e., ""customer,"" ""client,"" ""partner"") with potential to help pharmacists initially understand patients' preferences and expectations of care and services, little is known about potential factors that underlie these preferences and expectations. OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to [1] compare the prevalence of the current and desired patient-pharmacist relationships archetypes reported by patients and [2] identify the sociodemographic, health, and medication use and procurement factors predictive of the archetypes representing patients' current relationship with outpatient pharmacists. METHODS: Data from 1521 patients were collected via the 2021 National Consumer Survey on Medication Experience and Pharmacists' Role. Patient-pharmacist relationship distribution across patients' sociodemographic characteristics was explored using crosstabulations. Multinomial logistic regression was also used to investigate the association between patient sociodemographic characteristics and the current patient-pharmacist archetype relationships. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 53.9 years and 57.3% were married. Thirty-two percent of the patients reported currently having a ""Customer"" relationship, while 17.9% and 15.2% reported having a ""Client"" and ""Partner"" archetype relationship, respectively. ""Client"" (25.2%) and ""Partner"" (20.2%) relationships were the most commonly preferred archetypal relationships. The odds ratios (OR) of having ""Client"" or ""Partner"" relationships increased with the number of patients' health conditions and medications. Patients who visited independently owned and clinic pharmacies had a higher OR of building professional relationships with a pharmacist. CONCLUSION: The qualities of a patient-pharmacist relationship may be associated with key patient characteristics. Pharmacists can build relationships with patients informed by a continuum of patient preferences, expectations, and needs to optimize health outcomes.",0
A qualitative study on people with opioid use disorders' perspectives on smoking and smoking cessation interventions.,"INTRODUCTION: Smoking-related diseases are major contributors to disability and shorter life expectancy among opioid-dependent patients. Smoking prevalence is considerably higher for opioid-dependent persons than among the general population, and only a minority quit smoking in treatment settings. Studies show that pharmacological smoking cessation interventions have modest success rates. This study aimed to investigate patients' receiving opioid agonist therapy perspectives on factors affecting behavior and decisions related to smoking cessation, and their experiences with smoking cessation. METHODS: This is a qualitative study using semi-structured individual interviews. The participants were asked, among others, to elaborate on the participants' thoughts about smoking, previous attempts to quit tobacco use, and what could prompt a smoking cessation attempt. We analyzed the transcripts with systematic text condensation. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research and the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines were followed. Opioid-dependent patients receiving opioid agonist therapy in outpatient clinics were invited to participate using a purposive sampling method. In total, fourteen individuals participated in this study. RESULTS: We identified six themes which were: (1) reflections on how smoking affected decisions, (2) smoking and its impact on physical and mental health, (3) the economy as a motivator to stop smoking, (4) emotions, desires, and habits related to smoking, (5) knowledge of smoking, smoking cessation, and quit attempts, and (6) social factors influencing the participants' choices and activities. The participants were well informed about the consequences of smoking and had some knowledge and experience in quitting. The participants' pulmonary health was an important motivational factor for change. Withdrawal symptoms, anxiety, and fear of using other substances discouraged several from attempting to quit smoking. In contrast, social support from partners and access to meaningful activities were considered important factors for success. Few reported being offered help from health professionals to make a smoking cessation attempt. DISCUSSION: Experiencing social support, being encouraged to quit smoking, and patients' concerns for their physical health were important reasons for wanting to quit smoking. Smoking cessation interventions based on patient preferences and on the behavior change wheel may enable a higher success rate among patients receiving opioid agonist therapy.",0
"Oropharynx pain, discomfort, and economic impact of transesophageal echocardiography for planned radio-frequency catheter ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation: A cross-sectional survey study.","BACKGROUND: To survey the unmet medical needs associated with atrium thrombus screening in Chinese patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for planned radio-frequency catheter ablation (RFCA). METHODS: This cross-sectional survey study interviewed 300 patients who underwent their first TEE for planned RFCA. The surveyed information included patients' anxiety, oropharynx pain and discomfort, time expense, and patient satisfaction related to TEE examination. Patient preference for a new atrium thrombus screening technology, hospital length of stay (LOS) of RFCA, and hospital costs of RFCA in these surveyed patients were collected as well. Descriptive statistical methods were used to summarize the collected survey information. RESULTS: Of the 300 interviewed patients, 36.3% reported anxiety before TEE examination, 58.6% reported oropharynx pain related to TEE, and 76.2% reported oropharynx discomforts, mainly including foreign body sensation (54.3%), dry heaves (33.8%), nausea (31.9%), and bleeding (22.9%). Even though 62.3% were satisfied with TEE, 84.3% preferred a new technology to replace TEE. Conducting outpatient TEE took more wait time (4.4 days vs. 0.1 days, p = 0.016) but led to significantly shorter hospital LOS (3.8 days vs. 6.4 days, p < 0.001) and significant lower hospital costs for RFCA (¥74,097 vs. ¥85,843, p < 0.001) than conducting inpatient TEE. CONCLUSIONS: Most AF patients experienced oropharynx pain and discomfort during or after TEE. Although more than half of AF patients were satisfied with TEE, most AF patients preferred a new technology to replace TEE for atrium thrombus screening. TEE was associated with economic impact on RFCA irrespective of TEE conducting settings.",0
Physicians approach shared decision-making for sports eligibility decisions heterogeneously.,"BACKGROUND: There is limited data regarding how clinicians operationalize shared decision-making (SDM) with athletes with cardiovascular diagnoses. This study was designed to explore sports cardiologists' conceptions of SDM and approaches to sports eligibility decisions. METHODS: 20 sports cardiologists were interviewed by telephone or video conference from October 2022 to May 2023. Qualitative descriptive analysis was conducted with the transcripts. RESULTS: All participants endorsed SDM for eligibility decisions, however, SDM was defined and operationalized heterogeneously. Only 6 participants specifically referenced eliciting patient preferences during SDM. Participants described variable roles for the physician in SDM and variable views on athletes' understanding, perception, and tolerance of risk. Participants thresholds for prohibitive annual risk of sudden cardiac death ranged from <1 % to >10 %. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reinforce the general acceptance of SDM for sports eligibility decisions and highlight the need to better understand this process and identify the most effective approach for operationalization.",0
Analysis of patients' thoughts and background factors influencing attitudes toward Deprescribing: interviews to obtain hints for highly satisfying and valid prescriptions.,"BACKGROUND: Prescribing with high levels of medical appropriateness and patient satisfaction improves adherence. However, its appropriateness does not always match patient preference. Deprescription is important for ensuring the safety of medication therapy, but is not straightforward. Although successful deprescribing requires knowledge of patients' thoughts on their prescriptions and factors that influence their acceptance of deprescribing, few comprehensive studies have been conducted on this topic. The aim of this study was to identify factors that influence patients' attitudes toward deprescribing and obtain hints on how to achieve higher patient satisfaction and prescribing adequacy. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to hospitalized patients and a logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine factors that influence their attitude toward deprescribing. Individual factors affecting patients' thoughts and wishes regarding prescribing were extracted and analysed in detail. RESULTS: The analysis included 106 patients, of whom 40 (37.7%) wished deprescribing. Logistic regression analysis showed that ""Age"", ""Wish to reduce the number and types of medications"", ""Satisfaction"", ""Concerns about side effects"", and ""Wish not to have certain medications changed"" were factors influencing attitudes toward deprescribing. The results suggested that the factors were influenced by patients' perceptions and individual patient backgrounds. There was a gap between willingness to reduce medication and to change their medications. Seventy-eight percent of all respondents indicated that they would like to reduce the number and type of pills they take if possible. However, only 44.6% of these patients indicated that they would actually like to change their medication. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the only one to comprehensively investigate prescription content, patient background, and patients' thoughts on factors influencing attitudes toward deprescribing. This study revealed five factors that can influence inclination toward deprescribing. In addition, the results suggest that patients want to be able to feel well with fewer medications if possible. This information may be useful in determining prescriptions that have high validity and patient satisfaction. Further research is needed on the gap between willingness to reduce medications and to change medications.",0
Safety outcomes and patients' preferences for home-based intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in pompe disease and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) disorder: COVID-19 and beyond.,"BACKGROUND: The Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) demands precise information on benefit/risk profile of home-based enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of patients with Pompe disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). This passage is necessary to obtain the authorization for ERT home therapy, even after the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic period. This research intends to evaluate the safety, treatment satisfaction, and compliance of MPS I patients treated with laronidase (Aldurazyme®) and Pompe Disease patients treated with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme®) in a homecare setting. RESULTS: We report herein an early interim analysis of the HomERT (Home infusions of ERT) study, a multicenter, non-interventional, double-cohort study that retrospectively analyzed 38 patients from 14 sites in Italy: cohort A (Pompe disease - 32 patients) and cohort B (MPS I - 6 patients). Among the selected patients who started home therapy before enrollment, the average number of missed home-based infusions was 0.7 (1.3) in cohort A and 3.8 (6.4) in cohort B with no return to the hospital setting. Irrespective of the treatment location, 3 prior ADRs per cohort were reported. The majority of patients preferred home-based infusions (cohort A: 96.9%; cohort B: 100%): the main reason was attributed to treatment convenience (cohort A: 81.3%; cohort B: 83.3%). Despite the underlying conditions, most patients self-evaluated their health as ""good"" (cohort A: 50%; cohort B: 83.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of favorable safety profile, improved treatment compliance and personal satisfaction validates the use of ERT with laronidase and alglucosidase alfa as a strong candidate for home therapy.",0
The role of topical therapies along the psoriasis patient journey: An overview from the Symposium 'Tailoring topical psoriasis treatments to patients' needs and expectations' of the 30(th) EADV Congress 2021.,"This article summarizes a presentation titled 'The role of topical therapies along the psoriasis patient journey' held at the Satellite Symposium of the 30(th) European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress. During this session, the role of topical treatments in the management of psoriasis was presented, with a particular focus on the current unmet needs and data gaps. Psoriasis plays a significant role in a patient's daily life, impacting them not only physically but also psychologically and socially. The disease burden increases with duration and severity. Topical therapies are the keystone of the management of psoriasis. About 70%-80% of patients present a mild-to-moderate form of psoriasis that can be successfully treated with topical agents. According to a German recommendation, patients with mild psoriasis should initiate a topical therapy in combination with skin care products. In the real-life setting, the calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (CAL/BDP) fixed combination was the most prescribed topical treatment for beyond-mild patients in Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. Healthcare professionals also often or very often prescribed topicals as an alternative to non-biologic systemics in certain situations, such as patient preference (51%), contraindication (50%) and to limit side effects (26%). Adjunctive topical therapy to patients using systemic therapy is used to optimize treatment outcomes and improving the quality of life for patients. Topical treatments can be also effective in severe forms of psoriasis. However, there are still some gaps and unmet needs on topical therapy. Ineffectiveness, patient dissatisfaction and adherence are the largest barriers to treatment success. Main strengths of topical treatments include the availability of various topical ingredients and galenics, the adaptability to different anatomical areas and the possible combination with phototherapy and systemics. Moreover, patients in specific situations can benefit from switching to topical treatments (e.g. pregnancy or surgery).",0
Preferences of pregnant individuals to undergo labor after one cesarean in southern China.,"BACKGROUND: Labor after cesarean (LAC) remains an optional delivery method among healthy pregnant individuals. Exploring women's attitudes, preferences, reasons for previous cesarean delivery, and the incentives underlying pregnant individuals' preferences could help us understand their choice of delivery mode. In this study we evaluated the preferences and attitudes of eligible pregnant women regarding participation in a LAC in Foshan, China. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 438 pregnant individuals with one prior cesarean delivery (CD) who attended their antenatal examination at a tertiary hospital in southern China, between November 1, 2018, and October 31, 2019. Information on demographic characteristics, obstetric data, preferences for LAC, and incentives for LAC were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 85.4% (374/438) of women preferred LAC if they did not have contraindications before delivery, whereas 12.3% (54/438) refused and 2.3% (10/438) were unsure. Participants reported that the most important factors affecting their willingness to undergo LAC were safety indicators (i.e., ""ability of hospitals to perform emergency cesarean delivery"" [score of 9.28 ± 1.86]), followed by accessibility indicators (i.e., ""priority bed arrangements"" [score of 9.17 ± 1.84]). Logistic regression analysis indicated that neonatal wellbeing with the prior CD was an independent influencing factor (OR = 2.235 [95%CI: 1.115-4.845], p = 0.024) affecting willingness to access LAC in the subsequent pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high preference for LAC among pregnant individuals without contraindications before delivery in southern China. Healthcare providers need to ensure access to LAC and increase pregnant individuals' LAC willingness through high-quality shared decsision-making in alignment with patient preferences.",0
Variation in seizure risk increases from antiseizure medication withdrawal among patients with well-controlled epilepsy: A pooled analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Guidelines suggest considering antiseizure medication (ASM) discontinuation in seizure-free patients with epilepsy. Past work has poorly explored how discontinuation effects vary between patients. We evaluated (1) what factors modify the influence of discontinuation on seizure risk; and (2) the range of seizure risk increase due to discontinuation across low- versus high-risk patients. METHODS: We pooled three datasets including seizure-free patients who did and did not discontinue ASMs. We conducted time-to-first-seizure analyses. First, we evaluated what individual patient factors modified the relative effect of ASM discontinuation on seizure risk via interaction terms. Then, we assessed the distribution of 2-year risk increase as predicted by our adjusted logistic regressions. RESULTS: We included 1626 patients, of whom 678 (42%) planned to discontinue all ASMs. The mean predicted 2-year seizure risk was 43% [95% confidence interval (CI) 39%-46%] for discontinuation versus 21% (95% CI 19%-24%) for continuation. The mean 2-year absolute seizure risk increase was 21% (95% CI 18%-26%). No individual interaction term was significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. The median [interquartile range (IQR)] risk increase across patients was 19% (IQR 14%-24%; range 7%-37%). Results were unchanged when restricting analyses to only the two RCTs. SIGNIFICANCE: No single patient factor significantly modified the influence of discontinuation on seizure risk, although we captured how absolute risk increases change for patients that are at low versus high risk. Patients should likely continue ASMs if even a 7% 2-year increase in the chance of any more seizures would be too much and should likely discontinue ASMs if even a 37% risk increase would be too little. In between these extremes, individualized risk calculation and a careful understanding of patient preferences are critical. Future work will further develop a two-armed individualized seizure risk calculator and contextualize seizure risk thresholds below which to consider discontinuation. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Understanding how much antiseizure medications (ASMs) decrease seizure risk is an important part of determining which patients with epilepsy should be treated, especially for patients who have not had a seizure in a while. We found that there was a wide range in the amount that ASM discontinuation increases seizure risk-between 7% and 37%. We found that no single patient factor modified that amount. Understanding what a patient's seizure risk might be if they discontinued versus continued ASM treatment is critical to making informed decisions about whether the benefit of treatment outweighs the downsides.",0
Patient Preferences in Metastatic Breast Cancer Care: A Scoping Review.,"People with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) have diverse medical, physical, and psychosocial needs that require multidimensional care. Understanding patient preferences is crucial to tailor treatments, services, and foster patient-centered care. A scoping review was performed to summarize the current evidence on the preferences of people with MBC regarding their care to identify knowledge gaps and key areas for future research. The Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycInfo databases were searched. Twenty studies enrolling 3354 patients met the study eligibility criteria. Thirteen quantitative studies, four mixed methods studies, and three qualitative studies were included. Seven studies captured healthcare provider perspectives; thirteen studies evaluated patient preferences relating specifically to cancer treatments; three studies evaluated preferences relating to supportive care; and four studies evaluated communication and decision-making preferences. The current literature evaluating MBC patient preferences is heterogeneous with a focus on cancer treatments. Future research should explore patient preferences relating to multidisciplinary, multi-modal care that aims to improve quality of life. Understanding MBC patient preferences regarding their comprehensive care can help tailor healthcare delivery, enhance the patient experience, and improve outcomes.",1
Bariatric Surgery for Adults With Class I Obesity and Difficult-to-Manage Type 2 Diabetes: A Health Technology Assessment.,"BACKGROUND: Many individuals with type 2 diabetes are classified as either overweight or obese. A patient may be described as having difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes if their HbA1c levels remain above recommended target levels, despite efforts to treat it with lifestyle changes and pharmacotherapy. Bariatric surgery refers to procedures that modify the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with class II or III obesity, bariatric surgery has resulted in substantial weight loss, improved quality of life, reduced mortality risk, and resolution of type 2 diabetes. There is some evidence suggesting these outcomes may also be possible for patients with class I obesity as well. We conducted a health technology assessment of bariatric surgery for adults with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes, which included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding bariatric surgery, and patient preferences and values. METHODS: We performed a systematic clinical literature review. We assessed the risk of bias of each included study, using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials, the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for cohort studies, and the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool for systematic reviews; we assessed the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature review and conducted a cost-utility analysis of bariatric surgery in comparison with nonsurgical usual care over a lifetime horizon from a public payer perspective. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding bariatric surgery for adults with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes in Ontario. To contextualize the potential value of bariatric surgery, we spoke with people with obesity and type 2 diabetes who had undergone or were considering this procedure. RESULTS: We included 14 studies in the clinical evidence review. There were large increases in diabetes remission rates (GRADE: Low to Very low) and large reductions in body mass index (GRADE: Low to Very low) with bariatric surgery than with medical management. Bariatric surgery may also reduce the use of medications for type 2 diabetes (GRADE: Low) and may improve quality of life for people with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes compared with medical management. (GRADE: Low)Our economic evidence review included 5 cost-effectiveness studies; none were conducted in a Canadian setting, and 4 were considered partially applicable to our research question. Most studies found bariatric surgery to be cost-effective compared to standard care for patients with class I obesity and type 2 diabetes; however, the applicability of these results to the Ontario context is uncertain due to potential differences in clinical practice, resource utilization, and unit costs.Our primary economic evaluation found that over a lifetime horizon, bariatric surgery was more costly (incremental cost: $8,151 per person) but also more effective than current usual care (led to a 0.339 quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gain per person). The cost increase was driven by costs associated with surgery (before, after, and during surgery), and the QALY gain was due to life-years gained. Results were sensitive to the bariatric surgery cost and assumptions regarding its long-term benefits with respect to weight loss and diabetes remission.Publicly funding 50 bariatric surgeries in year 1, and gradually increasing to 250 surgeries in year 5, for people with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes would lead to budget increases of $0.55 million in year 1 to $2.45 million in year 5, for a total of $7.63 million over 5 years.The people with obesity and type 2 diabetes with whom we spoke reported that bariatric surgery was generally seen as a positive treatment option, and those who had undergone the procedure reported positively on its value as a treatment to manage their weight and diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: For adults with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery may be more clinically effective and cost-effective than medical management. Compared with medical management in people with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery may result in large increases in diabetes remission rates, large reductions in BMI, and reduced medication use for type 2 diabetes, improved quality of life. Over a lifetime horizon, bariatric surgery led to a cost increase and QALY gain. Bariatric surgery can result in postsurgical complications that are not faced by those receiving medical management. The cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery depends on its long-term impacts on obesity-related and diabetes-related complications, which could be uncertain.Our budget impact analysis suggests that publicly funding bariatric surgery in Ontario for people with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes would lead to a budget increase of $7.63 million over 5 years.For people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery was seen as a potential positive treatment option to manage their weight and diabetes.",0
A qualitative study of teleconsultation practices among French oncologists in a post-COVID-19 period.,"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted healthcare professionals to adapt and implement new tools to ensure continuity of patient care. Teleconsultation became the only option for some practitioners who had never used it previously and boosted its use for others who already used it. Several studies have reviewed the use of teleconsultation in oncology during the epidemic, but few have addressed its continued use and how practitioners view it in a post-epidemic period. The aim of this survey was to conduct a qualitative exploration of how oncologists use teleconsultation in their daily practice in a post-COVID 19 period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this qualitative study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with oncologists in France who utilized teleconsultation in the field of oncology during the COVID-19 period. The interview guide included questions on the interests and limitations of using teleconsultation in oncology, on reluctance to use it among oncologists, and invited participants to formulate proposals for more optimal use. RESULTS: Fourteen oncologists participated in the survey. Currently, 12% of the consultations of the surveyed practitioners are conducted via teleconsultation. Seven themes were identified in the analysis of the interviews: (a) The oncologist and teleconsultation; (b) Clinical motivations for using teleconsultation; (c) Comparison between teleconsultation and in-person consultation; (d) Advantages and disadvantages of teleconsultation; (e) Technical modalities of teleconsultation; (f) Role of Covid and confinement in the use of teleconsultation; (h) Epistemic judgments about teleconsultation. Optimal teleconsultation occurs when seamlessly incorporated into patient care, offering reduced patient inconvenience, and providing economic and environmental benefits. Although there's a lack of unified agreement in research literature regarding time efficiency, teleconsultation facilitates more customized patient monitoring and addresses the challenge of ""medical deserts"" nationally. Considering patient preferences is crucial when contemplating the use of teleconsultation. Predominantly, technical issues stand as the principal barriers to teleconsultation implementation. CONCLUSION: Even after the end of the health crisis, teleconsultation is still used in clinical practice. Recommendations for effective use are suggested.",0
Videoconferencing of Movement-Based and Psychologically Informed Interventions for Chronic Pain: A Systematic Review and Horizon Scan.,"Introduction: With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, use of telehealth technology increased dramatically. Nonpharmacological approaches to pain management may be well suited for virtual care. Yet, it is not widely understood if this treatment modality is effective when delivered via videoconferencing. This review examines the effectiveness of movement-based and psychologically informed chronic pain management interventions delivered via videoconferencing compared to in-person care. Methods: Searches of MEDLINE(®) (via Ovid(®)), Embase (via Elsevier), CINAHL Complete (via EBSCO), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (via Ovid) were performed from inception to June 10, 2021. All articles meeting eligibility criteria were included for data abstraction. Results: Eight thousand two hundred fifty-two citations were identified, and after removing duplicates, 4,661 citations remained. One study investigating acceptance and commitment therapy met eligibility criteria. The noninferiority randomized trial found no statistically significant difference in outcomes between delivery modalities. A horizon scan was conducted to assess planned or recent studies. Horizon scan results yielded six protocols in trial databases, one pilot study, and three published protocols for ongoing studies. Discussion: Findings from this study indicate that virtually delivered pain management is a possible substitute for in-person care. Given the paucity of evidence on this topic, further comparative and adequately powered studies that assess the impact of movement-based and psychologically informed pain management delivered via videoconferencing are needed. Conclusions: Research is needed to understand patient preferences of such interventions within a variety of settings. Such evaluations will be needed to guide clinical and operations practice to optimize equitable deployment and access to high-quality health care delivered via videoconferencing.",0
Understanding Intraoperative Transfusion Decision-Making Variability: A Qualitative Study.,"There is evidence of significant intraoperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion variability that cannot be explained by case-mix, and may reflect unwarranted transfusions. The objective was to explore the source of intraoperative RBC transfusion variability by eliciting the beliefs of anesthesiologists and surgeons that underlie transfusion decisions. Interviews based on the Theoretical Domains Framework were conducted to identify beliefs about intraoperative transfusion. Content analysis was performed to group statements into domains. Relevant domains were selected based on frequency of beliefs, perceived influence on transfusion, and the presence of conflicting beliefs within domains. Of the 28 transfusion experts recruited internationally (16 anesthesiologists, 12 surgeons), 24 (86%) were Canadian or American and 11 (39%) identified as female. Eight relevant domains were identified: (1) Knowledge (insufficient evidence to guide intraoperative transfusion), (2) Social/professional role and identity (surgeons/anesthesiologists share responsibility for transfusions), (3) Beliefs about consequences (concerns about morbidity of transfusion/anemia), (4) Environmental context/resources (transfusions influenced by type of surgery, local blood supply, cost of transfusion), (5) Social influences (institutional culture, judgment by peers, surgeon-anesthesiologist relationship, patient preference influencing transfusion decisions), (6) Behavioral regulation (need for intraoperative transfusion guidelines, usefulness of audits and educational sessions to guide transfusion), (7) Nature of the behaviors (overtransfusion remains commonplace, transfusion practice becoming more restrictive over time), and (8) Memory, attention, and decision processes (various patient and operative characteristics are incorporated into transfusion decisions). This study identified a range of factors underlying intraoperative transfusion decision-making and partly explain the variability in transfusion behavior. Targeted theory-informed behavior-change interventions derived from this work could help reduce intraoperative transfusion variability.",0
Treatment preferences among patients with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis.,"Study purpose: New treatments for atopic dermatitis (AD) are emerging; however, little is known about the treatment preferences of patients with mild-to-moderate AD. To measure patients' preferences, a cross-sectional, web-based discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey was developed and administered to 300 adults in the United States with a self-reported physician diagnosis of mild-to-moderate AD.Materials and methods: In the DCE, respondents evaluated pairs of hypothetical AD treatment profiles defined by efficacy, risk, and mode and frequency of administration attributes. The DCE data were analyzed using a random parameters logit model. Subgroup analysis was used to investigate preference heterogeneity.Results: The results revealed achieving clear or almost clear skin within 3-4 months of treatment was the most important attribute relative to all other study attributes. The results indicated that a topical cream applied twice daily was preferred to systemic treatments. Subgroup analysis revealed that respondents with lower self-assessed disease burden were more likely to choose topical over systemic treatments and less averse to the risk of pain, burning, and/or stinging from the medicine (all other treatment features remaining equal) than respondents with higher self-assessed disease burden.Conclusion: The results of this study can help inform shared decision-making to manage mild-to-moderate AD.",1
Collagenase Treatment Versus Needle Fasciotomy for Single-Digit Dupuytren Contractures: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"PURPOSE: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the available randomized controlled trial data comparing needle fasciotomy and collagenase treatment for single-digit Dupuytren contractures with a minimum of 3-year follow-up and determine whether one treatment is superior regarding contracture correction and functional outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching four databases for randomized controlled trials investigating the single-digit treatment outcomes for Dupuytren contracture comparing collagenase treatment and needle fasciotomy with a minimum of 3-year follow-up. The risk of bias of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model in anticipation of unobserved heterogeneity. The primary outcome measure was contracture recurrence. Secondary outcome measures included final fixed flexion contracture (FFC), Quick Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) scores, and Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main (URAM) scores. RESULTS: After screening 264 articles, 4 randomized clinical trials were eligible for final inclusion. One trial had a high risk of bias, and two trials had some concern for bias. The final meta-analysis included 347 patients, 169 who underwent collagenase treatment and 178 who underwent needle fasciotomy. No significant differences were noted between the groups in contracture recurrence, FFC, and URAM scores. The pooled data showed a higher QuickDASH score in the collagenase treatment group compared with the needle fasciotomy group, but the observed difference was less than what would be expected to be clinically relevant. CONCLUSIONS: Needle fasciotomy and collagenase treatment have similar outcomes with regards to contracture recurrence, final FFC, QuickDASH scores, and URAM scores for the single-digit treatment for Dupuytren contracture at a minimum of 3-year follow-up. Relevant factors that may be considered during the shared decision-making process for treatment selection include surgeon and patient preferences, costs of treatment, and the disparate complication profiles of these two treatments.

HTA community perspectives on the use of patient preference information: lessons learned from a survey with members of HTA bodies.,"This research sought to assess whether and how patient preference (PP) data are currently used within health technology assessment (HTA) bodies and affiliated organizations involved in technology/drug appraisals and assessments. An exploratory survey was developed by the PP Project Subcommittee of the HTA International Patient and Citizen Involvement Interest Group to gain insight into the use, impact, and role of PP data in HTA, as well as the perceived barriers to its incorporation. Forty members of HTA bodies and affiliated organizations from twelve countries completed the online survey. PP data were reported to be formally considered as part of the HTA evidence review process by 82.5 percent of the respondents, while 39.4 percent reported that most of the appraisals and assessments within their organization in the past year had submitted PP data. The leading reason for why PP data were not submitted in most assessments was time/resource constraints followed by lack of clarity on PP data impact. Participants reported that PP data had a moderate level of influence on the deliberative process and outcome of the decision, but a higher level of influence on the decision's quality. Most (81.8 percent) felt patient advocacy groups should be primarily responsible for generating and submitting this type of evidence. Insights from the survey confirm the use of PP data in HTA but reveal barriers to its broader and more meaningful integration. Encouragingly, participants believe obstacles can be overcome, paving the way for a second phase of research involving in-depth collaborative workshops with HTA representatives.",0
Barriers and Facilitators to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis by Men Who Have Sex with Men and Community Stakeholders in Malaysia.,"BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) in Malaysia are disproportionately affected by HIV. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an evidence-based HIV prevention strategy; yet, uptake remains low among Malaysian MSM, who have a limited understanding of barriers to PrEP. METHODS: We employed the nominal group technique (NGT), a structured mixed-methods strategy to understand the barriers and facilitators to PrEP use among Malaysian MSM, combined with a qualitative focus group. Six virtual focus group sessions, three among MSM (n = 20) and three among stakeholders (n = 16), were conducted using a video-conferencing platform. Rank-ordering of barriers from NGT was recorded, and thematic analysis was conducted for content. RESULTS: Similar barriers were reported by MSM and community stakeholders, with aggregated costs associated with PrEP care (e.g., consultation with a clinician, medication, laboratory testing) being the greatest barrier, followed by limited knowledge and awareness of PrEP. Additionally, the lack of access to PrEP providers, the complex clinical protocol for PrEP initiation and follow-up, and social stigma undermined PrEP delivery. Qualitative discussions identified potential new strategies to overcome these barriers, including expanded outreach efforts to reach hard-to-reach MSM, a 'one-stop' delivery model for PrEP services, a patient-centered decision aid to guide PrEP uptake, and easy access to LGBT-friendly PrEP providers. CONCLUSION: Current barriers may be overcome through governmental subsidy for PrEP and evidence-informed shared decision aids to support both MSM and PrEP providers.",0
Sequencing Systemic Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Multiple treatment options are now approved for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-containing regimen should be highly considered as the first-line treatment when there is no contraindication, especially in those with hepatitis virus-related HCC, due to proven superior overall survival (OS) compared to sorafenib. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab remain the treatment of choice among all ICI-containing regimens, unless contraindications to either of the medications exist. Although sorafenib is still the only medication currently approved for select patients with Child-Pugh B (CP) HCC in the first-line setting, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is being studied in this patient population. Moreover, patients with post-liver transplantation recurrence may benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), while more studies are still needed to determine the safety of ICIs in this setting. Interestingly, multiple potential biomarkers, including tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI) status, and PD-L1 expression level, have inconsistently predicted response to ICIs in patients with HCC. Limited evidence is available to guide treatment choice in later-line settings after progressing on ICIs, and decisions should be based on the safety profile of the treatment regimen and patient preference. Multiple trials are ongoing to elucidate the optimal treatment sequence. Of note, we believe that TKIs (e.g., cabozantinib, regorafenib, lenvatinib, and sorafenib) could be more beneficial in later-line settings to broaden inhibition of other pathways apart from vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). When conventional treatment options are exhausted, tissue biopsy may be helpful to reveal rare targetable mutations, such as RET gene fusions.",0
Utility of Platelet-Rich Plasma Therapy in the Management of Meniscus Injuries: A narrative review.,"Menisci are crucial for knee joint functions and meniscal tears are common injuries, especially in sports activities. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which enhances healing, has emerged as a promising additive treatment for meniscus injuries, utilizing the regenerative properties of platelets and growth factors for improved clinical outcomes. In studies with a follow-up period of less than one year, the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy for meniscus injuries showed significant improvements in knee symptoms and daily activity. Patients experienced enhanced outcomes in terms of pain reduction and increased sports activity, with MRI scans indicating stable meniscus conditions after six months. Studies with a follow-up of more than one year, however, did not find significant differences between groups treated with PRP and groups not treated with PRP in terms of various outcome measures, including pain and knee function. The vascularization of the menisci is vital for their proper function, and insufficient blood supply can affect healing of meniscal injuries. PRP therapy is used to enhance meniscal healing by introducing growth factors and anti-inflammatory agents. PRP therapy may enable athletes with meniscal tears to return to sports more quickly and has less rehabilitation duration. While PRP seems promising as an alternative to failed treatment or as an adjunct to treatment in the short term, its long-term effectiveness remains inconclusive. Patient preferences, commitment to therapy rehabilitation, and cost should all be considered on an individual basis.",0
Mobile health applications for epilepsy in Indian app stores: A systematic review and content analysis using the mobile app rating scale.,"OBJECTIVE: The growing prevalence of smartphones may prompt individuals with epilepsy to pursue unfulfilled healthcare requirements through mobile health (mHealth) apps, but the content and quality of these mHealth apps are rarely analysed. Hence, this study aimed to identify and assess the quality of epilepsy apps for patients with epilepsy (PWE), their caregivers, and healthcare practitioners (HCPs) available in the Play Store and App Store of India. METHODS: We performed a systematic search on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store of India to identify the mHealth apps for epilepsy which were released and updated till May 2023. The identified applications were downloaded and the quality was assessed using a Mobile app rating scale (MARS) for the overall quality, Aesthetics, Engagement, Functionality, and Information by three independent reviewers. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to assess the interrater reliability between the reviewers. An unpaired t-test was calculated to analyse the difference in mean scores for Android and iOS applications. RESULTS: The systematic search yielded a total of 2518 apps, out of which 26 were selected for inclusion in the study. Among these, 9 apps were compatible with Android, 11 with iOS, and 6 on both platforms. The mean (SD) MARS score of the apps was 3.5 (0.6) and the ICC for the overall app quality was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82-0.96). Overall, apps scored highest in functionality (3.9), followed by aesthetics (3.6), information (3.3), and engagement (3.2). Among the included apps, the overall quality score was found to be higher for iOS apps than Android (MD = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.02 - 1.07; p-value: 0.042). CONCLUSION: Our study identified twenty-six mHealth applications for epilepsy that integrated various aspects of epilepsy self-management. The results of this study emphasize the importance of ensuring that current and future applications offer evidence-based information, integrate features that align with patient preferences, and generate evidence regarding the effectiveness of application usage.",0
First-Trimester Screening Program for the Risk of Pre-eclampsia Using a Multiple-Marker Algorithm: A Health Technology Assessment.,"BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia is when high blood pressure develops after 20 weeks of pregnancy and either proteinuria, maternal end-organ dysfunction, or uteroplacental dysfunction causing fetal growth restriction also develops. The Fetal Medicine Foundation has created an algorithm (""the FMF algorithm"") that uses maternal factors in combination with biophysical and biochemical markers to identify people at high risk for pre-eclampsia so that they can been offered acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) as a preventive measure. We conducted a health technology assessment to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of a first-trimester population-wide screening program for pre-eclampsia risk that uses the FMF algorithm (""the FMF-based screening program""). We also evaluated the accuracy of the FMF algorithm, the budget impact of publicly funding the population-wide FMF-based screening program, and patient preferences and values. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each study using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions tool and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-Comparative tool, and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature search and conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the FMF-based screening program to standard care (screening for risk of pre-eclampsia using maternal factors alone) from a public payer perspective. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding a population-wide FMF-based screening program in Ontario. We spoke with people who have experience with pregnancy and preeclampsia and their family members through direct interviews to gather preferences and values surrounding pre-eclampsia and the potential screening program. RESULTS: We included nine studies in the clinical evidence review. The FMF-based screening program likely reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia with delivery at less than 37 weeks' gestation compared with standard care, when initiated at 11+(0) to 13+(6) weeks' gestation; risk ratios ranged from 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-0.93) to 0.70 (95% CI 0.58-0.84) (GRADE: Moderate). It may reduce the risks of low birth weight (risk ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.85-0.94]) and low Apgar score (risk ratio 0.73 [95% CI 0.63-0.85]) (GRADE: Low). Evidence on the effectiveness of the FMF-based screening program in reducing the risk of stillbirth and neonatal death was highly uncertain (GRADE: Very low). In addition, the FMF algorithm can improve the detection rate of pre-eclampsia with delivery at less than 37 weeks' gestation or at less than 34 weeks' gestation compared with conventional algorithms, although there are concerns about bias and applicability across studies. The population-wide FMF-based screening program is more effective and more costly than standard care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the population-wide FMF-based screening program compared with standard care is $3,446 per prevented case of pre-eclampsia with delivery at less than 37 weeks. The annual budget impact of publicly funding the population-wide FMF-based screening program in Ontario ranges from an additional $1.23 million in year 1 to $3.56 million in year 5, for a total of $8.50 million over the next 5 years. The population-wide FMF-based screening program was seen as valuable by those who have experienced pregnancy and their family members. Strong emphasis was placed on providing education and equitable access as part of any screening program, and participants valued the potential clinical benefits that the population-wide FMF-based screening program could provide. CONCLUSIONS: The FMF-based screening program is likely more effective than standard care in reducing the risk of pre-eclampsia with delivery at less than 37 weeks' gestation. Also, the FMF algorithm can improve the detection rate of pre-eclampsia with delivery at less than 37 weeks' gestation or at less than 34 weeks' gestation when compared with conventional algorithms. The population-wide FMF-based screening program is more effective and more costly than standard care. We estimate that publicly funding the population-wide FMF-based screening program in Ontario would result in additional costs of $8.50 million over the next 5 years. Pregnant people and their family members valued the potential equitable access, information, and clinical benefits that the population-wide FMF-based screening program could provide.",0
Use of Patient Preferences Data Regarding Multiple Risks to Inform Regulatory Decisions.,"Background and Objectives. Risk-tolerance measures from patient-preference studies typically focus on individual adverse events. We recently introduced an approach that extends maximum acceptable risk (MAR) calculations to simultaneous maximum acceptable risk thresholds (SMART) for multiple treatment-related risks. We extend these methods to include the computation and display of confidence intervals and apply the approach to 3 published discrete-choice experiments to evaluate its utility to inform regulatory decisions. Methods. We generate MAR estimates and SMART curves and compare them with trial-based benefit-risk profiles of select treatments for depression, psoriasis, and thyroid cancer. Results. In the depression study, SMART curves with 70% to 95% confidence intervals portray which combinations of 2 adverse events would be considered acceptable. In the psoriasis example, the asymmetric confidence intervals for the SMART curve indicate that relying on independent MARs versus SMART curves when there are nonlinear preferences can lead to decisions that could expose patients to greater risks than they would accept. The thyroid cancer application shows an example in which the clinical incidence of each of 3 adverse events is lower than the single-event MARs for the expected treatment benefit, yet the collective risk profile surpasses acceptable levels when considered jointly. Limitations. Nonrandom sample of studies. Conclusions. When evaluating conventional MARs in which the observed incidences are near the estimated MARs or where preferences demonstrate diminishing marginal disutility of risk, conventional MAR estimates will overstate risk acceptance, which could lead to misinformed decisions, potentially placing patients at greater risk of adverse events than they would accept. Implications. The SMART method, herein extended to include confidence intervals, provides a reproducible, transparent evidence-based approach to enable decision makers to use data from discrete-choice experiments to account for multiple adverse events. HIGHLIGHTS: Estimates of maximum acceptable risk (MAR) for a defined treatment benefit can be useful to inform regulatory decisions; however, the conventional metric considers one adverse event at a time.This article applies a new approach known as SMART (simultaneous maximum acceptable risk thresholds) that accounts for multiple adverse events to 3 published discrete-choice experiments.Findings reveal that conventional MARs could lead decision makers to accept a treatment based on individual risks that would not be acceptable if multiple risks are considered simultaneously.",1
Lessons from immunotherapies in multiple sclerosis.,"The improved understanding of multiple sclerosis (MS) neurobiology alongside the development of novel markers of disease will allow precision medicine to be applied to MS patients, bringing the promise of improved care. Combinations of clinical and paraclinical data are currently used for diagnosis and prognosis. The addition of advanced magnetic resonance imaging and biofluid markers has been strongly encouraged, since classifying patients according to the underlying biology will improve monitoring and treatment strategies. For example, silent progression seems to contribute significantly more than relapses to overall disability accumulation, but currently approved treatments for MS act mainly on neuroinflammation and offer only a partial protection against neurodegeneration. Further research, involving traditional and adaptive trial designs, should strive to halt, repair or protect against central nervous system damage. To personalize new treatments, their selectivity, tolerability, ease of administration, and safety must be considered, while to personalize treatment approaches, patient preferences, risk-aversion, and lifestyle must be factored in, and patient feedback used to indicate real-world treatment efficacy. The use of biosensors and machine-learning approaches to integrate biological, anatomical, and physiological parameters will take personalized medicine a step closer toward the patient's virtual twin, in which treatments can be tried before they are applied.",0
Determinants of Clinical Decision Making under Uncertainty in Dentistry: A Scoping Review.,"Clinical decision-making for diagnosing and treating oral and dental diseases consolidates multiple sources of complex information, yet individual clinical judgements are often made intuitively on limited heuristics to simplify decision making, which may lead to errors harmful to patients. This study aimed at systematically evaluating dental practitioners' clinical decision-making processes during diagnosis and treatment planning under uncertainty. A scoping review was chosen as the optimal study design due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the topic. Key terms and a search strategy were defined, and the articles published in the repository of the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE/PubMed) were searched, selected, and analysed in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Of the 478 studies returned, 64 relevant articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. Studies that were included were based in 27 countries, with the majority from the UK and USA. Articles were dated from 1991 to 2022, with all being observational studies except four, which were experimental studies. Six major recurring themes were identified: clinical factors, clinical experience, patient preferences and perceptions, heuristics and biases, artificial intelligence and informatics, and existing guidelines. These results suggest that inconsistency in treatment recommendations is a real possibility and despite great advancements in dental science, evidence-based practice is but one of a multitude of complex determinants driving clinical decision making in dentistry. In conclusion, clinical decisions, particularly those made individually by a dental practitioner, are potentially prone to sub-optimal treatment and poorer patient outcomes.",0
Telemedicine Satisfaction and Preferences in an Orthopaedic Spine Clinic.,"The use of telemedicine has expanded amid the COVID-19 pandemic and office closures and cancellation of elective surgeries early in the pandemic helped propagated its use. Previous studies have described the feasibility of telemedicine, however, little has been reported on patient perception and preferences within orthopaedics. The objective of this study was to evaluate satisfaction and preferences of telemedicine from the perspective of patients within an orthopaedic spine clinic. A cross-sectional, anonymous survey was implemented as a prospective quality improvement initiative. The survey was sent to patients who had an in-office or telemedicine visit with a provider in our orthopaedic spine clinic. Statistical analysis was performed on the results of the survey. The survey was sent to 1129 patients and a total of 316 patients responded. Twenty-one percent of respondents had a telemedicine appointment. There was no difference in satisfaction among groups (P = .288) and those with telemedicine appointments were more likely to have had a previous experience with this type of visit (P = .004) and were more inclined to use it in the future (P < .001). Patients preferred telemedicine because of the ability to get earlier appointments (P < .001) and the convenience of the visits (P < .001). Patients preferred in-office visits because they received hands-on physical exams (P = .003) or imaging (P = .041). Telemedicine is a viable alternative to in-office appointments for spine patients, as evidenced by similar levels of patient satisfaction. Sooner appointments and convenience are attractive elements of telemedicine visits, while the desire for physical examination remains a barrier to adoption in this population.",0
Mapping the experiences of people with advanced cancer across multiple cancer types-a scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Through the introduction of tumor agnostic therapies, people with metastatic cancer and their treating physicians are facing new treatment choices that have differing side effect and efficacy profiles from conventional chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: The present study undertakes a scoping review of research into the experiences of people with advanced or metastatic cancer across various solid tumor types with the goal of developing a tumor-agnostic conceptual model. DESIGN: Automated queries on three internet search engines were performed to identify qualitative interview studies that focused on people with metastatic cancer. No limits were imposed for dates nor location of studies. RESULTS: Of the 173 hits generated from the searches, 25 peer-reviewed papers were selected for the review with dates that ranged from 2007 to 2022. All papers originated from the USA, Europe, Australia, or Japan. Three major themes emerged that formed the basis for the tumor-agnostic conceptual model: symptoms, loss of autonomy, and adaptation/coping. CONCLUSIONS: The explication of the interplay between the physical and emotional symptoms experienced by those with advanced and metastatic cancer using a multi-tumor approach provides the potential to make generalizations about the needs of this population. An opportunity exists to potentially address these needs through matching patient needs and preferences with the characteristics of novel therapeutics. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: In the era of tumor agnostic therapies, the elicitation of patient preferences across the spectrum of anatomical origins has the potential to enhance shared decision making in the setting of metastatic disease.",0
Editorial Commentary: Surgical Videos on YouTube Are Not Peer Reviewed and Have Low Educational Value.,"The rise of online platforms like YouTube for health information has prompted scrutiny over the quality of medical/surgical-related video content. Recent research on YouTube videos regarding anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with quadriceps tendon autograft shows low educational quality and reliability using established assessment tools. Physicians primarily published content, with longer videos, and physician-generated videos, generally correlating with higher quality. However, YouTube's inadequacy as a reliable source for ACLR information underscores the need for alternative educational resources. Orthopaedic health care professionals must play a pivotal role in guiding patients toward credible sources and take aim at improving online content quality. Understanding patient preferences for online resources is essential for enhancing patient education, the patient-provider relationship, and decision-making in orthopaedic care.",0
Toenail Onychomycosis with or without Diabetes in Canada: Patient Treatment Preferences and Health State Utilities.,"BACKGROUND: Toenail onychomycosis affects approximately 6.7% of Canadians. Symptoms include nail discolouration/disfiguration and pain; psychosocial impacts contribute to reduced health-related quality-of-life. Comorbid diabetes increases the risk of complications and exacerbates burden. Treatment may include topical therapy and/or oral agents. PURPOSE: To understand toenail onychomycosis treatment preferences, and to quantify the impact of toenail onychomycosis, with or without diabetes, on patient well-being. METHODS: Adults living in Canada with self-reported, physician-diagnosed, toenail onychomycosis were recruited online. A discrete choice experiment was used to quantify treatment preferences. Scenarios were randomized; data were analyzed using conditional logit regression. Health state utilities were estimated using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3(®). Results were stratified by diabetes status and toenail onychomycosis severity; the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to assess between-group utility differences. RESULTS: Three-hundred thirteen participants with toenail onychomycosis were included (161 had comorbid diabetes; 61.3%, severe onychomycosis). The mean age was 57.7 years; 55.9% were male. Treatment attributes with statistically significant impacts on patient preferences were efficacy (odds ratio [OR],1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.05 per 1% increased treatment success), administration method (one pill versus topical nail lacquer reference, 1.14; 1.04-1.26; topical solution applicator versus reference: 1.15; 1.03-1.29), severe adverse events (0.85; 0.80-0.90 per 1% increased risk), and risk of potential pharmacodynamic (0.80; 0.76-0.85) and alcohol (0.93; 0.88-0.98) interactions; preferences were more pronounced for efficacy and avoiding severe adverse events among toenail onychomycosis patients with comorbid diabetes. The mean (95% CI) utility value was 0.73 (0.70-0.75) overall, and statistically significantly lower (p=0.02) for toenail onychomycosis patients with diabetes (0.70; CI, 0.66-0.73) than those without (0.76; CI, 0.72-0.79). CONCLUSION: Among patients with toenail onychomycosis, the presence of diabetes was associated with differing treatment-related preferences. Utility values for patients with toenail onychomycosis represent a significant decline from full health that is exacerbated by comorbid diabetes.",1
Development and validation of a psoriasis treatment acceptability measure through group concept mapping.,"BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a common autoimmune dermatologic condition which has a pronounced negative impact on patient quality of life and disease burden. Currently, there are a number of treatments available for psoriasis, with differences in efficacy, mechanism of action, mode of administration, adverse effects, and tolerability. However, a reliable, validated patient-reported instrument to address patient expectations and of psoriasis treatment has not been developed. This project was undertaken with the aim of developing a fit-for-purpose self-reported instrument to inform patient expectations and preferences of psoriasis treatments. METHODS: Two studies, both utilizing qualitative and quantitative methods, were conducted in patients within the entire spectrum of psoriasis severity. In Study 1, a group concept mapping (GCM) exercise was conducted with dermatologists and moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients to identify concepts important in the treatment of psoriasis. In Study 2, a preliminary Treatment Acceptability Questionnaire (TAQ) was developed using GCM-derived concepts from Studies 1 and 2, followed by cognitive debriefing (CD) telephone interviews of the preliminary TAQ. In Study 2, another GCM exercise was conducted with mild and newly diagnosed psoriasis patients. Psychometric analyses were performed on the TAQ to evaluate validity and reliability. RESULTS: The Study 1 GCM exercise generated 43 concepts from moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients (n = 20) and dermatologists (n = 10). In Study 2, 37 GCM concepts were generated from mild and newly diagnosed psoriasis patients (n = 20). From the 2 GCM exercises, 28 concepts were selected to form the preliminary TAQ; CD interviews indicated strong understanding and relevance of TAQ items among patients with disease ranging from mild to severe. The final TAQ consisted of 20 items; psychometric analysis demonstrated strong validity and reliability of the TAQ. CONCLUSIONS: The TAQ is a novel psychometrically validated patient-reported instrument to inform healthcare providers of patients' expectations of and preferences for treatment of their psoriasis and can help in shared decision making between patients and physicians.",1
Physical function and severe side effects matter most to patients with RA (< 5 years): a discrete choice experiment assessing preferences for personalized RA treatment.,"AIM: Early assessment of patient preferences has the potential to support shared decisions in personalized precision medicine for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to assess treatment preferences of patients with RA (< 5 years) with previous experience of inadequate response to first-line monotherapy. METHOD: Patients were recruited (March-June 2021) via four clinics in Sweden. Potential respondents (N = 933) received an invitation to answer a digital survey. The survey included an introductory part, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and demographic questions. Each respondent answered 11 hypothetical choice questions as part of the DCE. Patient preferences and preference heterogeneity were estimated using random parameter logit models and latent class analysis models. RESULTS: Patients (n = 182) assessed the most important treatment attributes out of physical functional capacity, psychosocial functional capacity, frequency of mild side effects and likelihood of severe side effects. In general, patients preferred a greater increase in functional capacity and decreased side effects. However, a substantial preference heterogeneity was identified with two underlying preference patterns. The most important attribute in the first pattern was the 'likelihood of getting a severe side effect'. Physical functional capacity was the most important attribute in the second pattern. CONCLUSION: Respondents focused their decision-making mainly on increasing their physical functional capacity or decreasing the likelihood of getting a severe side effect. These results are highly relevant from a clinical perspective to strengthen communication in shared decision making by assessing patients' individual preferences for benefits and risks in treatment discussions.",1
Patient-related outcomes of conventional impression making versus intraoral scanning for prosthetic rehabilitation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Intraoral scanning has been reported to be preferred by patients over conventional impression making. Nevertheless, information regarding patient-related outcomes for conventional impression making and digital scanning is sparse. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze patient-related outcomes of intraoral scanning and conventional impression methods. The primary outcomes evaluated were patient preference and satisfaction, and the secondary outcomes discomfort, nausea, unpleasant taste, breathing difficulty, pain, and anxiety. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual searches were performed for clinical trials that evaluated patient-related outcomes for intraoral scanning and conventional impression making for prosthetic rehabilitation. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa scale were used to assess the quality of the studies. Random-effects models using mean difference were used for meta-analyses. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q test and I(2) statistics (α=.05). RESULTS: The search strategy identified 1626 articles, and 11 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Patients preferred intraoral scanning to conventional impression making. The mean difference for patient preference was 15.02 (95% confidence interval of 8.33 - 21.73; P<.001). Discomfort, absence of nausea, absence of unpleasant taste, and absence of breathing difficulty were also significantly different (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoral scanning is a suitable alternative to conventional impression procedures, promoting less discomfort for patients sensitive to taste, nausea, and breathing difficulty than when conventional impression making techniques are used.",0
When attitudes and beliefs get in the way of shared decision-making: A mediation analysis of participation preference.,"INTRODUCTION: Certain sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., older age) have previously been identified as barriers to patients' participation preference in shared decision-making (SDM). We aim to demonstrate that this relationship is mediated by the perceived power imbalance that manifests itself in patients' negative attitudes and beliefs about their role in decision-making. METHODS: We recruited a large sample (N = 434) of outpatients with a range of urological diagnoses (42.2% urooncological). Before the medical consultation at a university hospital, patients completed the Patients' Attitudes and Beliefs Scale and the Autonomy Preference Index. We evaluated attitudes as a mediator between sociodemographic factors and participation preference in a path model. RESULTS: We replicated associations between relevant sociodemographic factors and participation preference. Importantly, attitudes and beliefs about one's own role as a patient mediated this relationship. The mediation path model explained a substantial proportion of the variance in participation preference (27.8%). Participation preferences and attitudes did not differ for oncological and nononcological patients. CONCLUSION: Patients' attitudes and beliefs about their role determine whether they are willing to participate in medical decision-making. Thus, inviting patients to participate in SDM should encompass an assessment of their attitudes and beliefs. Importantly, negative attitudes may be accessible to change. Unlike stable sociodemographic characteristics, such values are promising targets for interventions to foster more active participation in SDM. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This study was part of a larger project on implementing SDM in urological practice. Several stakeholders were involved in the design, planning and conduction of this study, for example, three authors are practising urologists, and three are psychologists with experience in patient care. In addition, the survey was piloted with patients, and their feedback was integrated into the questionnaire. The data presented in this study is based on patients' responses. Results may help to empower our patients.",0
Americans' Awareness of Access Changes and Utilization of Telehealth During COVID-19: A Survey in the United States.,"Background: We examine how and why Americans have experienced interrupted health care during the COVID-19 pandemic and measure awareness and usage of expanded benefits offered by health insurers and employers. We use an expanded concept of health literacy to include knowledge of access conditions and consider if patients' knowledge of the health system may relate to utilization of care. Methods: We conducted an online survey of 451 U.S. adults in September 2020, asking respondents about their health care experiences since March 1, 2020. This survey measured usage of medical care and awareness of the efforts made by government, private insurers, and employers to increase access to benefits such as telehealth services, well-being and mental health programs, and new prescription options. Results: The most common reasons cited for postponing or skipping medical appointments included fears over COVID-19 exposure, following local restrictions, or wanting to preserve resources for those with COVID-19. Our survey also finds that many Americans are largely unaware of whether they have access to expanded benefits implemented during the pandemic. Critically, respondents who recalled telehealth and prescription medication benefits being promoted were more likely to report using such benefits. Conclusion: This research suggests that greater attention to health literacy can help promote participation in the system by patients and has the potential to lead to improved health outcomes and greater adherence to treatment plans. Telehealth may offer patients increased opportunities to consult with their physicians for ailments that they might otherwise have delayed seeking care.",0
Quality of breaking bad news to patients diagnosed with neoplasia of the uterine cervix.,"OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the quality of receiving bad news (BN) for women diagnosed with cervical neoplasia. We evaluated adherence to the SPIKES protocol in three cohorts of women with different stages of the disease and treatment modalities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included women with cervical cancer who underwent radical vaginal trachelectomy (RVT group, n = 110), radical hysterectomy or chemo-radiation (HE/RCT group, n = 101), and women with CIN 3 treated by loop excision (CIN group, n = 108). We asked the participants about how they received the bad news delivery in reality and how they would envision an ideal communication process based on the main items of the SPIKES protocol. The participants filled out a questionnaire with 38 items of the Marburg Breaking Bad News (MABBAN) Scale representing the six SPIKES subscales. RESULTS: Only 72% of all patients reported being satisfied with their BBN experience. The following factors were considered important by 90% of the patients: an undisturbed atmosphere, taking enough time, coherent explanation of the disease, and the possibility to ask questions. However, the reality of their experiences fell significantly short of their expectations. Asking about the patient's knowledge of the disease, addressing their concerns, allowing them to show emotions, providing clarity about the change in quality of life, informing them about alternative therapies, and involving them in further planning were also significantly lacking in the actual BBN encounters compared to the patients' preferences. The experience of RVT patients was more negative compared to the HE/RCT patients (p = 0.036). The CIN patients had an overall satisfactory impression (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The process of breaking bad news in German women diagnosed with cervical neoplasia requires substantial improvement. The SPIKES protocol can be used as a guideline for enhancement but should be supplemented by incorporating a second consultation as the norm rather than the exception. Continuous monitoring and improvement of the quality of BBN is recommended for all oncologic institutions, utilizing the MABBAN questionnaire as a valuable tool.",0
"Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Surgery, Lasers, and Emerging Techniques.","Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that is characterized by painful nodules, abscesses and tunnels in skin folds. Current management of HS often requires a multidisciplinary approach, including medical, procedural, surgical, and psychosocial intervention. Here we review surgical techniques for the treatment of HS. While many surgical options are available for patients with HS, it is imperative that surgical planning focuses on medical optimization, patient risk factors, disease severity, and patient preferences to achieve the best outcomes.",0
"""Your cancer is no longer considered cancer"": Psychological reactions to reclassification information and communication preferences.","OBJECTIVE: In 2016, the encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (EFVPTC) was reclassified as noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP). This reclassification removed the word ""carcinoma"" and the definition of cancer from the diagnosis. While the nomenclature change was expected to psychologically impact patients, that question has not been systematically explored. Using qualitative methods, we aimed to explore the psychological impact of reclassification on thyroid cancer patients and their preferences for receiving reclassification information. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with nine non-EFVPTC thyroid cancer survivors were conducted. Participants were presented with a hypothetical reclassification scenario, and interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic content analytic approach. RESULTS: Participants expressed a range of psychological reactions to reclassification information, primarily negative, including anger, mistrust, and uncertainty, but also relief. All participants expressed difficulty understanding the concept of reclassification. Communication preferences favored conversation with an established medical provider over written materials, such as a letter. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Communication must align with patient preferences. Being mindful of potential negative psychological reactions when providing information on cancer reclassification is vital. INNOVATION: This study examines reactions to cancer reclassification information and preferences for how this information should be communicated.",0
Changes to Birth Plans Due to COVID-19: A Survey of Utah Midwives and Doulas.,"INTRODUCTION: This study seeks to understand the experiences of Utah midwives and doulas caring for patients during the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Specifically, the goal of the study was to describe the perceived impact on the community birth system and explore differences in the access and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) between in- and out-of-hospital births. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive study design. A 26-item survey developed by the research team was sent via email to Utah birth workers, including nurse-midwives, community midwives, and doulas. Quantitative data were collected during December 2020 and January 2021. Descriptive statistics were used in the analysis. RESULTS: Of the 409 birth workers who were sent a link to the survey, 120 (30%) responded: 38 (32%) CNMs, 30 (25%) direct-entry or community midwives, and 52 (43%) doulas. The majority (79%) reported changes to clinical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Community midwives (71%) who responded indicated practice volume increased. Survey participants reported an increased patient preference for home births (53%) and birth center births (43%). Among those with one or more patient transfers to the hospital, 61% experienced a change in the process. One participant reported that it took 43 minutes longer to transfer to the hospital. Community midwives and doulas reported poor access to a regular source of PPE. DISCUSSION: Survey participants reported changes to planned birth locations during the COVID-19 pandemic. When necessary, transfers to hospitals were reported to be slower. Community midwives and doulas reported having insufficient access to PPE and reported limited knowledge about COVID-19 testing resources and resources for educating patients on COVID-19. This study adds an important perspective to the existing literature on COVID-19 by indicating that policymakers should include community birth partners in community planning for natural disasters and future pandemics.",0
Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Before Radical Cystectomy for Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer: Elective and Eligibility Factors Impacting Utilization.,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to assess utilization of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and etiologies for lack of NAC receipt among patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). METHODS: Patients diagnosed with MIBC undergoing radical cystectomy at a single institution (2005-2021) were included. Patients were categorized by receipt of NAC, and reasons for no NAC were categorized into eligibility and elective factors. Overall survival was analyzed using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models and modeled with Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty patients with MIBC were included; 154 (40.5%) received NAC. Patients were not candidates for NAC due to renal dysfunction (16.6%), clinical contraindications (4.7%), salvage setting (2.1%), and histology (5.3%; total N = 109). Among 271 (71.3%) who were eligible, utilization increased from early (2005-2016) to recent (2016-2021) time periods (34.2% to 85.7% among NAC-eligible, P < .001; 22.8% vs 67.1% among all MIBC, P < .001). Elective factors for not receiving NAC included patient symptoms (7.8%), disease progression concern (7.0%), patient preference/refusal (20.3%) and provider discretion (8.1%) among 271 NAC-eligible patients. Notably, patient preference/refusal decreased from 33.6% to 3.4% in recent years (P < .001). On multivariable analysis, lack of NAC utilization due to renal dysfunction (HR 2.18, P = .002), clinical contraindications (HR 2.62, P = .01), and elective factors (HR 1.88, P = .01) were associated with worse overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: NAC utilization increased over time with 85.7% of eligible patients with MIBC receiving NAC in recent years. Renal dysfunction, patient preference, and clinical contraindications were primary etiologies for lack of NAC. Fewer patients refused NAC in recent years leading to a potential ceiling for NAC utilization.",0
Patient preferences and experiences regarding thrombopoietin-receptor agonists for immune thrombocytopenia in The Netherlands (TRAPeze Netherlands study).,"OBJECTIVE: Identify patient experience and preference towards thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) in treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in the Netherlands. METHODS: The Thrombopoietin-Receptor Agonist Patient experience (TRAPeze) survey used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit patient preferences and a patient burden survey (PBS) to evaluate the clinical and social impact of ITP. TRAPeze collected responses from 6th October to 19th November 2021. RESULTS: Seventy-six respondents completed the DCE: treatment preference appeared to be driven by method of administration (odds ratio [OR] 4.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.88-6.52), frequency of dosing (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.86-2.92) and drug-food interactions (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.54-2.37). Respondents preferred therapies delivered orally over subcutaneous injection (OR 4.22; 95% CI 2.76-6.46), dosed once weekly over once daily (OR 2.37; 95% CI 1.58-3.54) and without food restrictions over with restrictions (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.52-2.38). Sixty-nine respondents completed the DCE and PBS (mean [range] age 53 [19-83] years, 65% female). Seven incomplete PBS responses were excluded from analysis. Respondents were currently, or most recently, receiving eltrombopag (n = 43) or romiplostim (n = 26), of which 30% (n = 21/69) had previously received another TPO-RA. Loss (29%, n = 6/21) and lack (29%, n = 6/21) of response were the most common reasons for switching TPO-RA. Only 28% (n = 18/65) of respondents felt their TPO-RA increased energy levels. CONCLUSION: Patients preferred therapies delivered orally, dosed less frequently and without food restrictions. QoL of ITP patients on TPO-RAs can be improved; the burden analyses presented can inform future efforts towards this.",1
Exploring the Preferences of the Australian Public for Antibiotic Treatments: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: Identify Australian public preferences for antibiotic treatments in the context of antibiotic stewardship. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in Australia to investigate the importance of seven attributes associated with antibiotic treatments and related stewardship practices: contribution to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), treatment duration, side effects, days needed to recover, days before taking antibiotics, treatment failure and out-of-pocket costs. The DCE data were analysed using conditional logit, mixed logit and latent class conditional logit models. The relative importance of each attribute was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 1882 respondents completed the survey; the main study sample consist of 1658 respondents (mean age 48 years) who passed quality checks. All seven attributes significantly influenced respondents' preferences for antibiotic treatments. Based on the designed attribute levels in the DCE, on average, out-of-pocket costs (32.8%) and contribution to antibiotic resistance (30.3%) were the most important attributes, followed by side effects (12.9%). Days before starting medication was least important (3.9%). Three latent classes were identified. Class 1 (including respondents who were more likely to be older and more health literate; 24.5%) gave contribution to antibiotic resistance greater importance in treatment preferences. Class 2 (including respondents more likely to report poorer health; 25.2%) gave out-of-pocket costs greater importance. The remaining (50.4%), who were generally healthier, perceived side effects as the most important attribute. CONCLUSIONS: Despite concerted public awareness raising campaigns, our results suggest that several factors may influence the preferences of Australians when considering antibiotic use. However, for those more likely to be aware of the need to preserve antibiotics, out-of-pocket costs and limiting the contribution to antibiotic resistance are the dominant influence. Delays in starting treatment were not important for any latent class, suggesting public tolerance for this measure. These results could help inform strategies to promote prudent antibiotic stewardship.",1
Comparison of direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin in chronic limb-threatening ischemia.,"OBJECTIVE: The role of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in chronic limb-threatening ischemia after revascularization is unknown. Current evidence-based guidelines do not provide clear guidance on the role of anticoagulation or the selection of anticoagulant. Current practice is highly varied and based on provider and patient preference. The purpose of this study was to measure the impact of different anticoagulants on the incidence of major adverse limb events (MALEs) after revascularization for chronic limb-threatening ischemia, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for major bleeding events. METHODS: This was a single-center, observational, retrospective cohort study. Subjects were eligible if they were 18 years or older; underwent endovascular or open revascularization for chronic limb-threatening ischemia, rest pain, or tissue loss; and were subsequently prescribed apixaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin. The primary end point was the incidence of MALEs, including above-ankle amputation or major index-limb reintervention, within 1 year of index event. Secondary end points included the rate of all-cause mortality, MACEs, and incidence of International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding. RESULTS: From January 1, 2017, to September 20, 2022, 141 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were reviewed. The median age was 67 years, with 92 patients prescribed apixaban or rivaroxaban and 49 patients prescribed warfarin. Of these, 42 patients were prescribed triple antithrombotic therapy, 88 dual antithrombotic therapy, and 13 anticoagulant monotherapy. The primary outcome of 1-year MALEs occurred in 36.7% of the warfarin group and 33.7% of the DOAC group (relative risk [RR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.53-2.25; P = .72). Secondary outcomes of 1-year MACEs (10.2% vs 4.3%; RR, 2.35; 95% CI, 0.60-9.18; P = .18) and 1-year all-cause mortality (26.5% vs 16.3%; RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.70-3.78; P = .15) did not differ between the groups. The secondary safety outcome of 1-year ISTH major bleeding occurred in 16.3% of the warfarin group and 4.3% of the DOAC group (RR, 3.76; 95% CI, 1.07-13.19; P = .015). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia who were revascularized and prescribed anticoagulation with apixaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin on discharge, no difference in MALEs, MACEs, or all-cause mortality was found. However, 1-year admissions for ISTH major bleeding were significantly higher among patients prescribed warfarin. A randomized trial may confirm these findings.",0
Research Knowledge Translation in Sensory Integration-Based Therapy: Exploring Subjectivity of Clinical Expertise.,"Background. Clinical expertise is the mechanism through which practitioners implement other components of evidence-based practice (EBP). Within occupational therapy practice, intervention approaches that are both closely and loosely aligned with Ayres' Theory of Sensory Integration are widespread, offering a unique opportunity to investigate the subjective nature of clinical expertise in EBP. Purpose. This qualitative study explored motivations to offer sensory integration-based interventions, and factors informing occupational therapists' clinical decision making in relation to an arguably contentious evidence base. Method. Six post-graduate sensory integration trained UK occupational therapists participated in individual semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed, member-checked and analyzed using thematic coding analysis. Findings. Despite sound understanding of theory and continuous efforts to develop clinical knowledge, non-traditional hierarchies of evidence notably inform clinical decisions. The clinical expertise required for integration of patient preferences, clinical state and circumstances, and research evidence is informed by pragmatic responses to facilitators and barriers across contexts, combined with unique profession-specific identity factors. Implications. While empirical healthcare research is ideally undertaken under controlled conditions, realities of clinical practice are rarely so clear cut. Study findings highlight important subjective factors that are central to real-world research knowledge translation and further understanding of the clinical expertise component of EBP.",0
An update on absolute and relative indications for dialysis treatment modalities.,"BACKGROUND: Choosing a dialysis modality is an important decision for people to make as their kidney failure progresses. In doing so, their options should be informed by any absolute or relative indications that may favour one modality over another. METHODS: In creating this update, we reviewed literature using a framework that considered first, high-level outcomes (survival and modality transition) from large registry data and cohort studies when considering optimal patient pathways; second, factors at a dialysis provider level that might affect relative indications; and third, specific patient-level factors. Both main types of dialysis modality, peritoneal (PD) and haemodialysis (HD), and their subtypes were considered. RESULTS: For most people starting dialysis, survival is independent of modality, including those with diabetes. Better survival is seen in those with less comorbidity starting with PD or home HD, reflecting continued improvements over recent decades that have been greater than improvements seen for centre HD. There are provider-level differences in the perceived relative indications for home dialysis that appear to reflect variability in experience, prejudice, enthusiasm, and support for patients and carers. Absolute contraindications are uncommon and, in most cases, where modality prejudice exists, e.g. obesity, Adult Polycystic Kidney Disease, and social factors, this is not supported by reported outcomes. CONCLUSION: Absolute contraindications to a particular dialysis modality are rare. Relative indications for or against particular modalities should be considered but are rarely more important than patient preferences.",0
What drives researcher preferences for chemical compounds? Evidence from conjoint analysis.,"We investigated the attributes and attribute levels that affect researcher preferences for chemical compounds. We conducted a conjoint analysis on survey data of Korean researchers using chemical compounds from the Korean Chemical Bank (KCB). The analysis estimated the part-worth utility for each attribute's level, calculated relative importance of attributes, and classified user segmentation with different patterns. The results show that the structure database offers the highest part-worth utility to researchers, followed by high new functionality, price, screening service, and drug action data provided only by the KCB. Notably, researchers view the offer of a structured database and high new functionality as more important than other attributes in decision-making about research and development of chemical compounds. Furthermore, the results of segmentation analysis demonstrated that researchers have distinct usage patterns of chemical compounds: researchers consider structure database and high new functionality in cluster 1; and high new functionality and price in cluster 2, to be the most appealing. We discussed some policy and strategic implications based on the findings of this study and proposed some limitations.",0
Early Pregnancy Loss Management in the Emergency Department vs Outpatient Setting.,"IMPORTANCE: Early pregnancy loss (EPL), or miscarriage, is the most common complication of early pregnancy, and many patients experiencing EPL present to the emergency department (ED). Little is known about how patients who present to the ED with EPL differ from those who present to outpatient clinics and how their management and outcomes differ. OBJECTIVE: To compare the management and outcomes of patients with EPL who present to the ED vs outpatient clinics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used the IBM MarketScan Research Database, a national insurance claims database. Participants were pregnant people aged 15 to 49 years in the US who presented to either an ED or outpatient clinic for initial diagnosis of EPL from October 2015 through December 2019. Data analysis was performed from May 2021 to March 2022. EXPOSURES: The primary exposure was location of service (ED vs outpatient clinic). Other exposures of interest included demographic characteristics, current pregnancy history, and comorbidities. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was EPL management type (surgical, medication, or expectant management). Complications, including blood transfusion and hospitalization, and characteristics associated with location of service were also evaluated. Bivariable analyses and multivariable logistic regression were used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 117 749 patients with EPL diagnoses were identified, with a mean (SD) age of 31.8 (6.1) years. Of these patients, 20 826 (17.7%) initially presented to the ED, and 96 923 (82.3%) presented to outpatient clinics. Compared with the outpatient setting, patients in the ED were less likely to receive surgical (2925 patients [14.0%] vs 23 588 patients [24.3%]) or medication (1116 patients [5.4%] vs 10 878 patients [11.2%]) management. In the adjusted analysis, characteristics associated with decreased odds of active (surgical or medication) vs expectant management included ED (vs outpatient) presentation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.44-0.47), urban location (aOR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82-0.91), and being a dependent on an insurance policy (vs primary policy holder) (aOR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.67-0.74); whereas older age (aOR per 1-year increase 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.01), established prenatal care (aOR, 2.35; 95% CI, 2.29-2.42), and medical comorbidities (aOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09) were associated with increased odds of receiving active management. Patients in the ED were more likely than those in outpatient clinics to need a blood transfusion (287 patients [1.4%] vs 202 patients [0.2%]) or hospitalization (463 patients [2.2%] vs 472 patients [0.5%]), but complications were low regardless of location of service. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of privately insured patients with EPL, differences in management between the ED vs outpatient setting may reflect barriers to accessing comprehensive EPL management options. More research is needed to understand these significant differences in management approaches by practice setting, and to what extent EPL management reflects patient preferences in both outpatient and ED settings.",0
"A cross-sectional study evaluating the knowledge, attitude, and practice of evidence-based medicine among resident doctors of a health-care Institution of National Importance in India.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promotes the integration of updated- best evidence with patient preferences and medical expertise for clinical decision-making. Despite the availability of high-quality evidence such as systematic review and meta-analysis, some clinicians manage their patients based on past experiences and expert opinion. Thus, this study was proposed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of EBM among resident doctors at a tertiary care hospital in India. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted among senior residents and final-year postgraduates (PGs) who were independently involved in clinical decision-making. By convenience sampling method, the participants were recruited, and the validated EBM Questionnaire (EBMQ) was distributed online for assessing the knowledge, attitude, and practice of EBM. Descriptive statistics were represented as frequency and proportions. RESULTS: A total of 102 resident doctors participated with male preponderance (74.5%). Nearly, 96 (94.1%) participants were already practicing EBM and 21.6% had undergone EBM training. Textbooks (50%) were the most often referred sources for EBM information. Specific EBM databases such as MEDLINE and Cochrane were also utilized by 37.3% of participants. More than 70% of participants understood the terms such as a randomized controlled trial, case-control study, and P value. A higher proportion (80.4%) of participants showed a positive attitude about patient care improved by EBM. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the resident doctors exhibited good knowledge and a positive attitude toward applying EBM in clinical decision-making. Periodic training through workshops or courses and integration of EBM with the PG curriculum would potentially enhance the EBM practice.",0
"Preferences for preventive treatments for rheumatoid arthritis: discrete choice survey in the UK, Germany and Romania.","OBJECTIVE: To quantify preferences for preventive therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) across three countries. METHODS: A web-based survey including a discrete choice experiment was administered to adults recruited via survey panels in the UK, Germany and Romania. Participants were asked to assume they were experiencing arthralgia and had a 60% chance of developing RA in the next 2 years and completed 15 choices between no treatment and two hypothetical preventive treatments. Treatments were defined by six attributes (effectiveness, risks and frequency/route of administration) with varying levels. Participants also completed a choice task with fixed profiles reflecting subjective estimates of candidate preventive treatments. Latent class models (LCMs) were conducted and the relative importance of attributes, benefit-risk trade-offs and predicted treatment uptake was subsequently calculated. RESULTS: Completed surveys from 2959 participants were included in the analysis. Most participants preferred treatment over no treatment and valued treatment effectiveness to reduce risk more than other attributes. A five-class LCM best fitted the data. Country, perceived risk of RA, health literacy and numeracy predicted class membership probability. Overall, the maximum acceptable risk for a 40% reduction in the chance of getting RA (60% to 20%) was 21.7%, 19.1% and 2.2% for mild side effects, serious infection and serious side effects, respectively. Predicted uptake of profiles reflecting candidate prevention therapies differed across classes. CONCLUSION: Effective preventive pharmacological treatments for RA were acceptable to most participants. The relative importance of treatment attributes and likely uptake of fixed treatment profiles were predicted by participant characteristics.",1
Patient Preferences and Their Effects on Rehabilitation Outcomes: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of aligning patients' preferences with specific rehabilitation delivery modes on rehabilitation outcomes. DESIGN: A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: The study cohort comprised 208 patients referred for physiotherapy rehabilitation after non-surgical or surgical interventions for rotator cuff injury, shoulder impingement, or acromioclavicular osteoarthritis. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three rehabilitation modalities: 1) group-based exercise, 2) individual exercise, or 3) home exercise. In this study, participants were categorized into two groups: ""matched preference"" (MP) and ""unmatched preference"" (UP). The primary outcome measure was change in function, measured with the shortened Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH). Secondary outcome measures were change in pain, assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), mental well-being measured with the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), health-related quality of life assessed using the EuroQol-5Domain questionnaire (EQ-5D), fear avoidance assessed using the Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire (ÖMPQ), and overall treatment satisfaction. Outcomes were assessed at 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: The primary outcome measure, QuickDASH, showed no significant differences between groups at either 3 months (-3.0 [-8.2 to 2.3]) or 6 months (0.5 [-5.7 to 6.7]). Additionally, no significant differences were observed in the secondary outcome measures. CONCLUSION: Matching patients' preferences for specific rehabilitation delivery modes did not seem to effect rehabilitation outcomes.",0
Adherence and Persistence to Nusinersen for Spinal Muscular Atrophy: A US Claims-Based Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic, neuromuscular disease caused by deletions and/or mutations in the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene leading to reduced SMN protein levels. Nusinersen, an intrathecally administered antisense oligonucleotide therapy that increases SMN protein levels, is approved for use in adult and pediatric patients with SMA. Data to inform real-world patient adherence and persistence to nusinersen are limited, with disparities in the population with SMA, study design, and results. The objective of this study is to characterize real-world nusinersen adherence and persistence in patients with SMA. METHODS: This retrospective study examined nusinersen adherence and persistence over a 2-year period in patients with SMA in the USA from the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus claims database. Patients were followed from the date of first evidence of nusinersen treatment (occurring after 1 July 2017) until the end of the study period (31 December 2019) or end of continuous pharmacy and medical benefit enrollment, whichever came first. Subgroup analyses for nusinersen adherence and persistence were performed on the basis of age and presence or absence of spinal complications. RESULTS: The final cohort consisted of 179 patients with SMA treated with nusinersen. Adherence to nusinersen treatment was 41% at 56 weeks and 39% at 104 weeks. In the base-case persistence analysis, there was a decrease in persistence before 6 months (67%) and further decline at 1 (57%) and 2 years (55%). Patients with spinal complication versus without had numerically higher persistence with nusinersen. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that adherence and persistence to nusinersen treatment appear low. Demographic (age ≥ 18 years) and clinical factors (no spinal complications) may contribute to nusinersen treatment discontinuation. Future research should explore possible reasons for low adherence and persistence to nusinersen treatment, such as clinical or logistical factors, patient preferences, and payer restrictions.",0
Development of a discrete choice experiment questionnaire to elicit preferences by pregnant women and policymakers for the expansion of non-invasive prenatal screening.,"OBJECTIVE: An instrument for measuring intervention preferences applicable to both patients and policymakers would make it possible to better confront the needs of the supply and demand sides of the health care system. This study aimed to develop a discrete choice experiments (DCE) questionnaire to elicit the preferences of patients and policymakers. The instrument was specifically developed to estimate preferences for new conditions to be added to a screening program for fetal chromosomal anomalies. METHODS: A DCE development study was conducted. The methods employed included a literature review, a qualitative study (based on individual semi-structured interviews, consultations, and a focus group discussion) with pregnant women and policymakers, and a pilot project with 33 pregnant women to validate the first version of the instrument and test the feasibility of its administration. RESULTS: An initial list of 10 attributes was built based on a literature review and the qualitative research components of the study. Five attributes were built based on the responses provided by the participants from both groups. Eight attributes were consensually retained. A pilot project performed on 33 pregnant women led to a final instrument containing seven attributes: 'conditions to be screened', 'test performance', 'moment at gestational age to obtain the test result', 'degree of test result certainty to the severity of the disability', 'test sufficiency', 'information provided from test result', and 'cost related to the test'. CONCLUSION: It is possible to reach a consensus on the construction of a DCE instrument intended to be administered to pregnant women and policymakers. However, complete validation of the consensual instrument is limited because there are too few voting members of health technology assessment agencies committees to statistically ascertain the relevance of the attributes and their levels.",1
Eliciting Depression Patients' Preferences for Medication Management: A Protocol for Discrete Choice Experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Depression threatens people's lives and imposes huge economic burden. Antidepressant therapy is the first-line treatment for depression, and patient adherence to medication is the key to successful treatment. Depression patients have poor medication adherence, which leads to failure of depression management and significantly poorer clinical outcomes. Incorporating patient preferences into clinical decisions can improve uptake rates, optimize treatment adherence. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) can elicit and quantify individual preferences. Previous DCE studies were conducted in developed countries and ignored the influences of factors other than the medication. This paper outlines an ongoing DCE that aims to (1) explore medication-management-related characteristics that may affect depression patients' adherence to antidepressant, (2) elicit how depression patients consider the trade-offs among different medication managements. METHODS: The six attributes and their levels were developed through a literature review, semi-structured interviews and experts and focus group discussions. A fractional factorial design in the software Ngene 1.2 version was used to generate 36 choice sets, and they were divided into 3 blocks. A mixed logit model will be used to explore the patients' preferences, willingness to pay and uptake rate of depression patients for medication management attributes. RESULTS: The final questionnaire consists of three parts. The first is the introduction, which introduces the purpose of the study and the requirements of completing the questionnaire. This was followed by a general information questionnaire, which included sociodemographic characteristics. The last part is DCE tasks, which include 13 DCE choice sets, and each choice set include two alternative and one ""opt-out"" option. The pilot-test results showed the questionnaire was easy to understand and could be used in formal surveys. CONCLUSION: Our study shows how the development process of the study can be conducted and reported systematically and rigorously according to the theoretical foundation and design principles in DCE.",1
Discrete Choice Experiment to Understand Japanese Patients' and Physicians' Preferences for Preventive Treatments for Migraine.,"INTRODUCTION: Self-injectable calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibody (mAb) auto-injectors and non-CGRP oral medications are currently available for migraine prevention in Japan. This study elicited the preferences for self-injectable CGRP mAbs and non-CGRP oral medications and determined differences in the relative importance of auto-injector attributes for patients and physicians in Japan. METHODS: Japanese adults with episodic (EM) or chronic (CM) migraine and physicians who treat migraine completed an online discrete choice experiment (DCE), asking participants to choose a hypothetical treatment they preferred between two self-injectable CGRP mAb auto-injectors and a non-CGRP oral medication. The treatments were described by seven treatment attributes, with attribute levels varying between questions. DCE data were analyzed using a random-constant logit model to estimate relative attribution importance (RAI) scores and predicted choice probabilities (PCP) of CGRP mAb profiles. RESULTS: A total of 601 patients (79.2% with EM, 60.1% female, mean age: 40.3 years) and 219 physicians (mean length of practice: 18.3 years) completed the DCE. About half (50.5%) of patients favored CGRP mAb auto-injectors, while others were skeptical of (20.2%) or averse (29.3%) to them. Patients most valued needle removal (RAI = 33.8%), shorter injection duration (RAI = 32.1%), and auto-injector base shape and need for skin pinching (RAI = 23.2%). Most physicians (87.8%) favored auto-injectors over non-CGRP oral medications. Physicians most valued less-frequent dosing RAI = 32.7%), shorter injection duration (30.4%), and longer storage outside the fridge (RAI = 20.3%). A profile comparable to galcanezumab showed a higher likelihood of being chosen by patients (PCP = 42.8%) than profiles comparable to erenumab (PCP = 28.4%) and fremanezumab (PCP = 28.8%). The PCPs of the three profiles were similar among physicians. CONCLUSION: Many patients and physicians preferred CGRP mAb auto-injectors over non-CGRP oral medications and preferred a treatment profile similar to galcanezumab. Our results may encourage physicians in Japan to consider patient preferences when recommending migraine preventive treatments.",1
Aortic Stenosis Phenotypes and Precision Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"Patients with a clinical indication for aortic valve replacement can either undergo surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). There are many different factors that go into determining which type of replacement to undergo, including age, life expectancy, comorbidities, frailty, and patient preference. While both options offer significant benefits to patients in terms of clinical outcomes and quality of life, there is growing interest in expanding the indications for TAVI due to its minimally invasive approach. However, it is worth noting that there are several discrepancies in TAVI outcomes in regards to various endpoints, including death, stroke, and major cardiovascular events. It is unclear why these discrepancies exist, but potential explanations include the diversity of etiologies for aortic stenosis, complex patient comorbidities, and ongoing advancements in both medical therapies and devices. Of these possibilities, we propose that phenotypic variation of aortic stenosis has the most significant impact on post-TAVI clinical outcomes. Such variability in phenotypes is often due to a complex interplay between underlying comorbidities and environmental and inherent patient risk factors. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that patient genetics may also play a role in aortic stenosis pathology. As such, we propose that the selection and management of TAVI patients should emphasize a precision medicine approach.",0

[Patient Preferences for Exercise Therapy in People with Severe Mental Illness in Germany].,"PURPOSE: Assessing the experience with and the attitudes towards exercise therapy in persons with severe mental illness (SMI). Furthermore, potential variables of high preference towards exercise therapy are investigated. METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study of SMI patients aged between 18 and 65 years (n=385). Patients were interviewed by trained staff using standardised instruments. Potential variables were analysed using a hierarchic binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: 84,4% of SMI patients had a high preference for exercise therapy; of these, 44,1% exercised regularly. Among patients with severe mental illness especially a higher value in the GAF-assessment (p=0,041) and living in a metropolitan area (p=0,011) predict a high preference for exercise therapy. CONCLUSION: Most of the patients with severe mental illness interviewed in this study place a surprisingly high value on sports and exercise therapy. Due to the increasing evidence with regard to positive effects of these therapies, it may be an excellent starting point to expand sports and exercise therapy as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. At the same time, strategies for everyday transfer need to be implemented more rigorously.",0
"Protocol of the Comparison of Intravesical Therapy and Surgery as Treatment Options (CISTO) study: a pragmatic, prospective multicenter observational cohort study of recurrent high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.","BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer poses a significant public health burden, with high recurrence and progression rates in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Current treatment options include bladder-sparing therapies (BST) and radical cystectomy, both with associated risks and benefits. However, evidence supporting optimal management decisions for patients with recurrent high-grade NMIBC remains limited, leading to uncertainty for patients and clinicians. The CISTO (Comparison of Intravesical Therapy and Surgery as Treatment Options) Study aims to address this critical knowledge gap by comparing outcomes between patients undergoing BST and radical cystectomy. METHODS: The CISTO Study is a pragmatic, prospective observational cohort trial across 36 academic and community urology practices in the US. The study will enroll 572 patients with a diagnosis of recurrent high-grade NMIBC who select management with either BST or radical cystectomy. The primary outcome is health-related quality of life (QOL) at 12 months as measured with the EORTC-QLQ-C30. Secondary outcomes include bladder cancer-specific QOL, progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and financial toxicity. The study will also assess patient preferences for treatment outcomes. Statistical analyses will employ targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) to address treatment selection bias and confounding by indication. DISCUSSION: The CISTO Study is powered to detect clinically important differences in QOL and cancer-specific survival between the two treatment approaches. By including a diverse patient population, the study also aims to assess outcomes across the following patient characteristics: age, gender, race, burden of comorbid health conditions, cancer severity, caregiver status, social determinants of health, and rurality. Treatment outcomes may also vary by patient preferences, health literacy, and baseline QOL. The CISTO Study will fill a crucial evidence gap in the management of recurrent high-grade NMIBC, providing evidence-based guidance for patients and clinicians in choosing between BST and radical cystectomy. The CISTO study will provide an evidence-based approach to identifying the right treatment for the right patient at the right time in the challenging clinical setting of recurrent high-grade NMIBC.

"""It's That They Treated Me Like an Object"": A Qualitative Study on the Participation of People Diagnosed with Psychotic Disorders in Their Health Care.","The mental health recovery model is based on shared decision making, in which patients' preferences and perceptions of the care received are taken into account. However, persons with psychosis usually have very few opportunities to participate in this process. The present study explores the experiences and perceptions of a group of patients with psychosis-in some cases longstanding, in others more recently diagnosed-concerning their participation in the decisions taken about the approach to their condition and about the attention received from healthcare professionals and services. For this purpose, we performed a qualitative analysis of the outcomes derived from five focus groups and six in-depth interviews (36 participants). Two major themes, with five sub-themes, were identified: shared decision-making (drug-centred approach, negotiation process, and lack of information) and the care environment and styles of clinical practice as determinants (aggressive versus person-centred environments, and styles of professional practice). The main conclusions drawn are that users want to participate more in decision making, they want to be offered a range of psychosocial options from the outset and that their treatment should be based on accessibility, humanity and respect. These findings are in line with the guidelines for clinical practice and should be taken into account in the design of care programmes and the organisation of services for persons with psychosis.",0
Values Assessment Tools in Advanced Cancer: A Clinical Literature Review.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced cancer may receive cancer treatment that does not reflect their values because they may not be completely aware of what is important to them regarding treatment-related decisions when they are diagnosed. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review was to determine whether existing values assessment tools can improve awareness of treatment-related decisional values in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: PubMed®, CINAHL®, and PsycINFO® databases were searched for original English-language articles evaluating values assessment tools that could be used to assess patients with advanced cancer. The quality of the identified tools was evaluated using selected International Patient Decision Aid Standards instrument, version 3.0, criteria. FINDINGS: All tools identified are appropriate for use in patients with advanced cancer. Two scored at least 80% on the selected International Patient Decision Aid Standards criteria. The Short Graphic Values History Tool was developed with patient and clinician input and may be particularly useful for low-literacy patient populations with advanced cancer. No values assessment tools have been identified specifically for use in patients with advanced cancer.",0
The impact of adding platelet-rich plasma during fat graft myringoplasty for managing medium-sized tympanic membrane perforations: A prospective randomized case-control study.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of adding platelet-rich plasma (PRP) during FGM to close medium-sized TM perforations. METHODS: This prospective randomized case-control study was conducted from February 2017 to March 2022. We included 320 patients with a medium-sized TM perforation with inactive mucosal otitis media. Transcanal FGM managed all patients under general or local anesthesia according to the patient preference. According to PRP, patients were divided into two groups: the first with PRP (170 patients) and the other without PRP (150 patients). We evaluated the closure rate of both groups one month, six months, and one year after the surgery. Also, we assessed the audiological performance before and one year after the operation for the patients with a successful closure. RESULTS: The closure rate was 87.6 % in the first group and 72.7 % in the second group, with a statistically significant difference between both groups as the P-value, was 0.001. Successful closure of the ABG to <10 dB occurred in 95.3 % of group A and 90.8 % of group B without a statistically significant difference between both groups (P-value = 0.163). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective comparative study on a relatively large number of patients revealed that FGM effectively closed medium-sized TM perforations. It also significantly improved postoperative audiological performance in both groups. Adding PRP during the FGM enhanced the closure success and the healing process without recorded complications. We recommend using the PRP in the routine FGM for closing medium-sized TM perforations.",0
Interest in advance provision of abortion pills: a national survey of potential users in the USA.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess interest in clinician-administered advance provision of abortion pills among potential users in the USA. METHODS: Using social media advertisements, we recruited people living in the USA who were aged 18-45 years and assigned female at birth, who were not pregnant or planning pregnancy, for an online survey on reproductive health experiences and attitudes. We explored interest in advance provision of abortion pills, participant characteristics, including demographics and pregnancy history, contraceptive use, abortion knowledge and comfort, and healthcare system distrust. We used descriptive statistics to assess interest in advance provision, and ordinal regression modelling to evaluate differences in interest controlling for age, pregnancy history, contraceptive use, familiarity and comfort with medication abortion, and healthcare system distrust, reporting adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: From January-February 2022, we recruited 634 diverse respondents from 48 states, among whom 65% were interested, 12% neutral, and 23% disinterested in advance provision. There were no differences among interest groups by US region, race/ethnicity, or income. In the model, variables associated with interest included being aged 18-24 years (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.4) versus 35-45 years, using a tier 1 (permanent or long-acting reversible) or tier 2 (short-acting hormonal) contraceptive method (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.1, and aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.9, respectively) versus no contraception, being familiar or comfortable with the medication abortion process (aOR 4.2, 95% CI 2.8 to 6.2, and aOR 17.1, 95% CI 10.0 to 29.0, respectively), and having high healthcare system distrust (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.4) versus low distrust. CONCLUSION: As abortion access becomes more constrained, strategies are needed to ensure timely access. Advance provision is of interest to the majority of those surveyed and warrants further policy and logistical exploration.",0
Understanding patient preferences for student clinician attire: a cross-sectional study of a student chiropractic clinic in Australia.,"OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have investigated the role of clinical attire in establishing patient-held perceptions of professionalism and knowledgeability across various healthcare settings. This study aimed to understand patients' preferences for chiropractic student attire. METHODS: Three hundred and twenty patients were recruited from a university chiropractic clinic and asked to complete an online questionnaire. The patients' preferences for five different attires were rated and calculated as the composite score of five domains (knowledgeable, trustworthy, caring, professional, and comfortable). RESULTS: While 71.9% of participants indicated that how students dress was important to them, most (63.4%) disagreed that wearing a white coat was essential for chiropractic student clinicians. The most preferred form of attire was the current clinic shirt. CONCLUSION: The attire worn by chiropractic student clinicians at a single institution was found to be an influential attribute. Student chiropractic clinicians should dress professionally to make a good first impression. This study provided some guidance with the ongoing debate around students' dress code.",0
"Feasibility, Effectiveness and Safety of Elastomeric Pumps for Delivery of Antibiotics to Adult Hospital Inpatients-A Systematic Review.","Elastomeric infusion pumps (EMPs) have been implemented in many fields, including analgesia, chemotherapy and cardiology. Their application in antimicrobials is mainly limited to the outpatient setting, but with a need to optimise inpatient antimicrobial treatment, the use of EMPs presents a potential option. This review aimed to identify if the use of EMPs within an inpatient setting is feasible, effective and safe for antimicrobial use. Criteria for inclusion were human studies that involved the treatment of an infection with intravenous antimicrobial agents via an EMP. A search strategy was developed covering both the indexed and grey literature, with all study designs included. The review found 1 eligible study enrolling 6 patients. There was strong patient preference for EMPs (6/6), and daily tasks were easily completed whilst attached to the EMP. Nurses (5/5) also preffered the pumps, and the majority reported them as easy to use. The review has identified the need for further research in the area. Evidence for the use of EMPs to administer antibiotics in the inpatient setting is scarce, and more work is needed to understand the advantages to patients, to healthcare workers and from an antimicrobial stewardship perspective. Potential disadvantages that may put patients at risk also need investigating.",0

How should patient decision aids for schizophrenia treatment be designed? - A scoping review.,"Despite the clear rationale for applying shared decision-making in the context of the preference sensitive decision for or against antipsychotics and the upswing of patient decision aids (pDAs) to support this process, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding which key features are crucial for pDAs in schizophrenia treatment. A scoping review according to the PRISMA-SRc was conducted to inform on crucial key features and quality indicators. The review focussed on the following seven aspects for investigating pDAs: (1) Types of decision aids, (2) Values, (3) Decision Guidance, (4) Output of the decision aid, (5) Target group, (6) Effectiveness according to publication and (7) Decision aid evaluation. Eleven studies which addressed six unique decision aids met the eligibility criteria. There were major differences in the design as well as in the development of the decision aids. Three aspects emerged that should be given special consideration in the design of such tools for antipsychotics: the evidence used by the decision aid, the algorithm for translating evidence into a decision aid and finally the presentation of the evidence. We recommend the use of data with a high level of evidence and to combine it with individualized treatment by taking into account patient preferences and previous experiences as well as comparing them with clinical assessments. Fully computerized decision aids that use complicated algorithms, for example, by merging treatment effects with patient characteristics to suggest an appropriate treatment at the end, tend to be paternalistic and thus not appropriate for SDM, in our view. In addition, possible cognitive deficits need to be considered when presenting the output of decision aids for antipsychotics.",0
Non-insulin Medications for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is predicted to affect 366 million people over the age of 65 years by the year 2030. As the understanding of the core defects associated with T2D advanced, researchers recognized management should target multiple defects in glucose metabolism. As a result, efforts to manage T2D focus on developing new drug therapies aimed at addressing each of the identified metabolic defects. Optimal treatment of T2D is necessary to decrease the risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, and vascular diseases. This article discusses non-insulin pharmacologic treatments for T2D that are guided by glycemic efficacy, safety profiles, effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk, tolerability, patient comorbidities, route of administration, patient preference, and cost.",0
Ethical Aspects of Prodromal Synucleinopathy Prognostic Counseling.,"Alpha-synucleinopathies can be identified in their prodromal phase, raising several ethical issues. In this review, we first provide definitions of prodromal α-synucleinopathies and discuss the importance of distinguishing between prodromes and risk factors. Next, we discuss the implications of a diagnosis of prodromal α-synucleinopathy and considerations regarding prognostic counseling in both clinical and research settings. We review available data on patient preferences regarding disclosure as well as providers' perspectives. We examine the pros and cons of disclosing a diagnosis of prodromal α-synucleinopathy, taking into consideration the differences between clinical and research settings. Asking about willingness to know in clinical and research settings and the shared decision-making process applied to prognostic counseling is discussed. Concerning research settings, ethical aspects regarding clinical trials are addressed. Availability of direct-to-consumer technologies will likely lead to novel contexts requiring prognostic counseling, and future neuroprotective or neuromodulating treatments may require further considerations on the timing, role, and importance of prognostic counseling. Recommendations on how to address ethical gaps should be a priority for patients, medical professional societies, and research workgroups. Ethical issues must be considered as an integral part of the overall clinical and research approach to prodromal synucleinopathies.",0
Attitudes towards disposition of cryopreserved sperm in the event of death.,"INTRODUCTION: To evaluate patient preference for sperm disposition in case of death based on demographic factors and infertility etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed at a university hospital-affiliated fertility center. Charts of 550 men undergoing cryopreservation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) between 2016-2019 were reviewed to create a descriptive dataset. Patients previously signed consent forms stating their preference for sperm transfer to their partner or disposal in the event of their subsequent death. Patients undergoing sperm cryopreservation for the purpose of ART were analyzed to assess associations between demographic characteristics and etiology of infertility and their choice to either transfer sperm to their partner or discard. RESULTS: A total of 84.9% (342/403) of patients included in final analyses elected to transfer their sperm to their partner in the event of their death. Factors associated with a significantly increased likelihood to transfer versus discard included a male-factor infertility diagnosis compared to female-factor infertility diagnosis (transfer rate 89.3% vs. 79.9%; p = .022) and commercial insurance coverage versus non-commercial/no insurance coverage (transfer rate 86.3% vs. 75.0%, p = .029). No significant differences relating to age, race/ethnicity, occupation classification, marital status or duration of marriage, or prior paternity were found. CONCLUSION: A majority of male patients seeking sperm cryopreservation for ART elected to transfer their sperm to their partner if future death should occur. There does not appear to be a clear factor that would impact this decision based on demographic characteristics.",0
Patient Preferences for Lung Cancer Interception Therapy.,"IMPORTANCE: Interception therapy requires individuals to undergo treatment to prevent a future medical event, but little is known about preferences of individuals at high risk for lung cancer and whether they would be interested in this type of treatment. OBJECTIVE: To explore preferences of individuals at high risk for lung cancer for potential interception therapies to reduce this risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study used a discrete-choice experiment and included hypothetical lung cancer interception treatments with 4 attributes: reduction in lung cancer risk over 3 years, injection site reaction severity, nonfatal serious infection, and death from serious infection. Respondents were assigned to a baseline lung cancer risk of 6%, 10%, or 16% over 3 years. The discrete-choice experiment was administered online (July 13 to September 6, 2022) to US respondents eligible for lung cancer screening according to US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines. Participants included adults aged 50 to 80 years with at least a 20 pack-year smoking history. Statistical analysis was performed from September to December 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Attribute-level preference weights were estimated, and conditional relative attribute importance, maximum acceptable risks, and minimum acceptable benefits were calculated. Characteristics of respondents who always selected no treatment were also explored. RESULTS: Of the 803 survey respondents, 495 (61.6%) were female, 138 (17.2%) were African American or Black, 55 (6.8%) were Alaska Native, American Indian, or Native American, 44 (5.5%) were Asian or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 104 (13.0%) were Hispanic, Latin American, or Latinx, and 462 (57.5%) were White, Middle Eastern or North African, or a race or ethnicity not listed; and mean (SD) age was 63.0 (7.5) years. Most respondents were willing to accept interception therapy and viewed reduction in lung cancer risk as the most important attribute. Respondents would accept a greater than or equal to a 12.0 percentage point increase in risk of nonfatal serious infection if lung cancer risk was reduced by at least 20.0 percentage points; and a greater than or equal to 1.2 percentage point increase in risk of fatal serious infection if lung cancer risk was reduced by at least 30.0 percentage points. Respondents would require at least a 15.4 (95% CI, 10.6-20.2) percentage point decrease in lung cancer risk to accept a 12.0 percentage point increase in risk of nonfatal serious infection; and at least a 23.1 (95% CI, 16.4-29.8) percentage point decrease in lung cancer risk to accept a 1.2 percentage point increase in risk of death from serious infection. Respondents who were unwilling to accept interception therapy in any question (129 [16.1%]) were more likely to be older and to currently smoke with no prior cessation attempt, and less likely to have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or examined for skin cancer. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of individuals at high risk of lung cancer, most respondents were willing to consider interception therapy. These results suggest the importance of benefit-risk assessments for future lung cancer interception treatments.",1
Preferences for Adjuvant Immunotherapy in Adults with Resected Stage III Melanoma-A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to quantify adult preferences for adjuvant immunotherapy for resected melanoma and the influence of varying levels of key attributes and baseline characteristics. METHODS: A D-efficient design generated 12 choice tasks for two alternative treatments, adjuvant immunotherapy or no adjuvant immunotherapy. Recruitment to the online discrete choice experiment (DCE) occurred via survey dissemination by eight Australian melanoma consumer and professional groups, targeting adults with resected stage III melanoma, considering or having received adjuvant immunotherapy. The DCE included six attributes with two to three levels each, including 3-year risk of recurrence, mild, permanent and fatal adverse events (AEs), drug regimen and annual out-of-pocket costs. A mixed multinomial logit model was used to estimate preferences and calculate marginal rates of substitution and marginal willingness to pay (mWTP). RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 116 respondents, who chose adjuvant immunotherapy over no adjuvant immunotherapy in 70% of choice tasks. Respondents preferred adjuvant immunotherapy when associated with reduced: probabilities of recurrence, permanent and fatal AEs, and out-of-pocket costs. mWTP for an absolute reduction of 1% in 3-year risk of recurrence was less for respondents with lower rather than higher incomes, AU$794 (US$527) and AU$2190 (US$1454) per year. Respondents accepted an additional 4% chance of a permanent AE to reduce their absolute risk of 3-year recurrence by 1%. Respondents were willing to accept an extra 2% chance of 3-year recurrence to lower their chance of a fatal AE by 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Almost three-quarters of respondents chose adjuvant immunotherapy over no adjuvant immunotherapy, preferring treatment that improved efficacy and safety. Findings may inform decisions about access to adjuvant immunotherapy following surgery for melanoma.",1
Perspectives of hospitalized heart failure patients: preferred and perceived participation roles in treatment decisions.,"Shared decision-making (SDM) is a pivotal process in seeking optimal individual treatment and incorporating clinical evidence and patients' autonomous preferences. However, patients' actual attitudes toward participation in decision-making for state-of-the-art heart failure (HF) treatment remain unclear. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey distributed by nurses and physicians specializing in HF care to assess patients' preferred and perceived participation roles in treatment decision-making during the index hospitalization, rated on five scales (from extremely passive to purely autonomous attitudes). Simultaneously, we investigated the important factors underlying treatment decision-making from the perspective of hospitalized HF patients. Of the 202 patients who were approached by our multidisciplinary HF team between 2017 and 2020, 166 (82.2%) completed the survey. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the clinical determinants of patients who reported that they left all decisions to physicians (i.e., extremely passive attitude). Of the 166 participants (male 67.5%, median age 73 years), 32.5% preferred an extremely passive attitude, while 61.4% reported that they actually chose an extremely passive attitude. A sole determinant of choosing an extremely passive decision-making role was lower educational status (odds ratio: 2.11, 95% confidence interval 1.11-4.00). The most important factor underlying the decision-making was ""Physician recommendation"" (89.2%). Notably, less than 50% considered ""In alignment with my values and preferences"" as an important factor underlying treatment decision-making. The majority of HF patients reported that they chose an extremely passive approach, and patients prioritized physician recommendation over their own values and preferences.",0
ADCC's Improving Goal Concordant Care Initiative: Implementing Primary Palliative Care Principles.,"BACKGROUND: High-quality, timely goals of care communication (GOCC) may improve patient and caregiver outcomes and promote care that is consistent with patient preferences. PROBLEM: Cancer patients, and their loved ones, appreciate GOCC; however, oncologists often lack formal communication training, institutional support and structures necessary to promote the delivery, documentation, and longitudinal follow-up of GOCC. PROPOSED SOLUTION: The Alliance of Dedicated Cancer Centers (ADCC), representing 10 U.S. academic cancer hospitals, undertook the Improving Goal Concordant Care Initiative (IGCC). This national, 3-year implementation initiative was designed in Fall 2019 by a workgroup of quality, oncology, and palliative care leaders, as well as patient and family advisory committee members (PFAC). IGCC addresses systemic gaps by requiring four core components for participation: 1) Implementation of a formal communication skills training (CST) program, 2) Structured GOCC documentation in the electronic medical record that is visible to all clinicians, 3) Expectations regarding the timing and patient populations for GOCC, and 4) Implementation of a measurement framework. METHOD: Dyads of palliative and oncology leaders committed to attend regularly scheduled, ADCC-led, virtual meetings during the design and implementation phase, incorporating PFAC feedback at every stage. Using the RE-AIM framework, we describe process and outcome evaluation measures defined by implementation and measures workgroups and collected routinely, including: CST completion; trainee evaluation response rate, trainee-reported quality of CST, trainee changes in self-efficacy and distress; percent of high-priority patients participating in GOCC, and patient-reported response to the ""Heard and Understood"" scale (HU). IGCC's impact will be assessed using claims-based utilization metrics near the end of life (EOLM) and followed longitudinally. Qualitative evaluations near the completion of IGCC will provide insight into perceived barriers, enabling factors, and sustainability. OUTCOMES: Implementation of all IGCC components has begun at all sites. ADCC-wide, 35% of MD/DOs have completed CST (range by site: 8%-100%). CST is highly rated; in Quarter 3, 2022, 93%-100%, 90%-100% and 87%-100% of respondents reported above average to excellent CST quality, likelihood to use the skills and likelihood to recommend CST to others, respectively. Clinician self-efficacy and distress ratings are expected in late 2023. All sites have identified patient populations and continue to refine automated triggers and timelines; uptake of GOCC documentation has been slow. Eight of 10 sites have submitted patient-reported HU data. EOLM data are expected for all sites in early 2024. LESSONS LEARNED: Flexibility in implementation with shared definitions, measures, and learnings about approaches optimizes the ability of all centers to collaborate and make progress in improving GOCC. Flexibility adds to the complexity of understanding intervention effectiveness, the critical intervention components and the fidelity necessary to achieve specific outcomes.",0
"Kidney biopsy in diabetic kidney disease. Yes, but in very selected cases.","The debate on kidney biopsy in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is multifaceted. Loreto Gesualdo and colleagues argue for its broader application, claiming that biopsies can offer precise diagnostic data and guide personalized treatment plans. On the other hand, Alberto Ortiz opposes this, citing insufficient evidence, resource constraints and potential risks. He suggests that alternative diagnostic methods, such as advanced imaging techniques and serological markers, will obviate the need for biopsy in most patients. Both sides agree on the need for individualized patient care, and open discussions between healthcare providers and patients about the procedure's risks and benefits. The application of kidney biopsy in these patients needs to consider clinical evidence, practical limitations and patient preferences, and demands a balanced, case-by-case approach. Overall, this moderator believes that, although fundamental in clinical research, kidney biopsy in DKD is infrequently needed.",0
Patient preferences for physical therapy programs after a lower extremity fracture: a discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify patients' preferences for physical therapy programmes after a lower extremity fracture and determine patient factors associated with preference variation. DESIGN: Discrete choice experiment. SETTING: Level I trauma centre. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty-one adult (≥18 years old) patients with lower extremity fractures treated operatively. INTERVENTION: Patients were given hypothetical scenarios and asked to select their preferred therapy course when comparing cost, mobility, long-term pain, session duration, and treatment setting. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A multinomial logit model was used to determine the relative importance and willingness to pay for each attribute. RESULTS: Mobility was of greatest relative importance (45%, 95% CI: 40% to 49%), more than cost (23%, 95% CI: 19% to 27%), long-term pain (19%, 95% CI: 16% to 23%), therapy session duration (12%, 95% CI: 9% to 5%) or setting (1%, 95% CI: 0.2% to 2%). Patients were willing to pay US$142 more per session to return to their preinjury mobility level (95% CI: US$103 to US$182). Willingness to pay for improved mobility was higher for women, patients aged 70 years and older, those with bachelor's degrees or higher and those living in less-deprived areas. Patients were willing to pay US$72 (95% CI: US$50 to US$93) more per session to reduce pain from severe to mild. Patients were indifferent between formal and independent home therapy (willingness to pay: -US$12, 95% CI: -US$33 to US$9). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lower extremity fractures highly value recovering mobility and are willing to pay more for postoperative physical therapy programmes that facilitate returning to their pre-injury mobility level. These patient preferences might be useful when prescribing and designing new techniques for postoperative therapy.",1
Indiana Pouch Continent Cutaneous Urinary Diversion After Robotic-assisted Radical Cystectomy: A 16-Year Experience.,"BACKGROUND: Population-based practice patterns in the United States reveal continent diversions are only performed in 8%-10.4% of patients.(1-4) Ideally, for patients undergoing radical cystectomy the choice of urinary diversion should be influenced by clinical factors and patient preference, with discussions surrounding quality of life. Unfortunately, receipt of continent diversion has been shown to be influenced by a plethora of other factors such as surgeon preference/training, geography, socioeconomic status, gender, and hospital volume.(1-3) Thus, by providing detailed instruction and long-term follow-up, we hope to mitigate some of these disparities by changing the perceptions regarding feasibility and complications of continent diversions. OBJECTIVE: To provide step-by-step instruction and to report long-term clinical outcomes in bladder cancer patients receiving an Indiana pouch continent cutaneous urinary diversion (CCUD) after robot-assisted radical cystectomy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: After Institutional Review Board approval, a prospectively maintained bladder cancer database was queried for patients with T1-T4, N0-N1, M0 bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy with CCUD at a tertiary referral center from 2004 to 2020. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Complications at 30- and 90-day were recorded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Continence rates were recorded by chart review. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 97 patients were included with a median follow-up of 93months. Clinically, 91.8% had ≤T2 disease and 29.9% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The median length of surgery was 8.0 hours, length of hospital stay was 8.3days, and urinary continence rate was 99.0%. The overall complication rate was 73.2% and 76.5% at 30- and 90-day, respectively. The major complication rate (Clavien III-V) was 17.5% at 30-day and 22.7% at 90-day. The most common major complications were abdominal infection and uretero-colonic stricture. The readmission rate was 21.4% and median overall survival was 108months. CONCLUSION: CCUD provides exceptional functional outcomes with acceptable complication rates compared to other diversion types. CCUD is a reliable reconstructive option and with this step-by-step video as a reference, we hope it will be offered to more patients.",0
"Provider perspectives on patient-centered contraceptive counseling for Latinas in Baltimore, MD.","OBJECTIVES: To explore: 1) provider narratives of their contraceptive counseling practices with Latina patients within the context of patient-centered care (PCC); and 2) provider perceptions about the barriers to the provision of patient-centered contraceptive counseling in general and more specifically, with Latina patients in Baltimore, MD. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted 25 semistructured qualitative interviews with physicians  and nurse practitioners from four specialties who provide contraceptive care to Latinas in Baltimore, MD. We analyzed data using directed content analysis. We discuss findings with attention to major constructs of PCC, applying a reproductive justice framework. RESULTS: Providers described a contraceptive counseling approach focused on pregnancy prevention as the primary goal. Most respondents used a tiered-effectiveness approach, even while noting the importance of PCC. Providers noted health system barriers to PCC, including time constraints and insurance status. Provider-reported patient-attributed barriers included low patient education/health literacy, culturally-attributed misconceptions about contraception, and language discordance. CONCLUSION: Providers described knowledge of and intention to practice PCC but had limited integration of it in their own counseling with Latinas. Responses suggest tension between an expressed desire to provide PCC and paternalistic counseling paradigms that prioritize pregnancy prevention over patient preferences. Inequitable health system barriers also interfere with true implementation of contraceptive PCC. IMPLICATIONS: Translating contraceptive PCC into practice, especially for marginalized communities, is paramount. Training should teach clinicians to recognize systems of structural inequity and discrimination that have informed approaches to counseling but are not reflective of PCC. Institutional policies must address health system barriers that also hamper PCC.",0
Effectiveness of exercise interventions to improve long-term outcomes in people living with mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Although exercise guidelines now recommend exercise for patients with MCI, the long-term effects of exercise in patients with MCI has not been reviewed systematically. The aim was to assess (1) the effectiveness of exercise and physical activity (EXPA) interventions in improving long-term patient-relevant cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes in people with mild cognitive impairment, (2) how well the included trials reported details of the intervention, and (3) the extent to which reported endpoints were in line with patient preferences that were assessed in patient workshops. Following PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis including randomized controlled trials. A total of ten studies were included after searching in six electronic sources from 1995 onwards. There is a trend that 6 + -month EXPA interventions improve global cognition 12 months after initiation. Evidence on long-term effects of EXPA interventions on non-cognitive health outcomes could not be meaningfully pooled and the individual studies reported mixed results. Workshop participants considered freedom from pain and stress, mood, motivation and self-efficacy to be important, but these outcomes were rarely addressed. Too little information is available on intervention details for EXPA programs to be replicated and confidently recommended for patients with MCI.

A Longitudinal Evaluation of the Preferences of Patients With Advanced Cancer for Quality of Life and Survival in Malaysia: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to quantify the preferences of patients with advanced cancer for quality of life (QoL) outcomes versus survival extension in Malaysia. The secondary aim of this study is to explore the change in preferences over time. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was developed to include 7 attributes valued in cancer management: physical, psychological and social functioning, pain control, survival, place of death, and cost. Patients were recruited via convenience sampling from 2 Malaysian public hospitals. The survey questionnaire was administered to patients within 6 months of their cancer diagnosis with a follow-up 3 months later. Conditional logit regression was used to estimate the preference weight, relative attribute importance, and willingness to pay. RESULTS: One hundred valid responses were collected at baseline and 45 at follow-up. Respondents placed higher values on QoL improvements from severe to moderate or mild levels and to achieve home death over survival extension from 6 to 18 months. However, additional improvements (from moderate to mild) in some of the QoL outcomes were not valued as highly as life extension from 12 to 18 months, showing that it was vital for patients to avoid being in ""severe"" health dysfunction. Improving physical dysfunction from severe to mild yielded 3 times as much value as additional 1-year survival. After 3 months, the respondents' preferences changed significantly, with increased relative attribute importance of physical functioning, pain control, and cost. CONCLUSIONS: As QoL outcomes are valued more than survival, palliative care should be introduced as early as possible to alleviate suffering related to advanced cancer.",1
Understanding Patient Perspectives Regarding Remote Monitoring Devices Following Total Joint Replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Advances in smart technology have expanded into the field of orthopedic surgery to deliver enhanced patient care. Smart technology has also raised important issues regarding protected patient information. The purpose of this study is to determine patient preferences regarding smart technology in their postarthroplasty care. METHODS: Patient surveys were administered in the office setting of 2 adult reconstructive orthopedic surgeons during a 4-week period. Surveys queried patient demographics, twelve yes/no questions, five continuous agree/disagree statements, and a single free-text question. Logistic regression and statistical significance testing were performed. RESULTS: Of the study patients, 83.6% were willing to wear a device. Women were more likely to consent to a monitoring device and have activity data collected than men (P < .05). Younger patients were more likely to consent to a device and have data collected than octogenarians. Nearly 90% of respondents indicated peace of mind with data being constantly tracked. However, 64% of respondents had hesitations about a surgically implanted device that was independent of a previous arthroplasty surgery (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients are comfortable with smart technology being involved in their postoperative care, especially younger patients and women. Older individuals, possibly with less experience using smart technology in their lives, were not as willing to wear smart devices or have their data collected. Nearly two-thirds of patients had hesitations about surgically implanted smart devices. Further investigation is needed to understand hesitations concerning smart implants as the orthopedic community enters an era of commercially available smart implants in total joint arthroplasty.",0
A Novel Approach to Computing Preference Estimates for Different Treatment Pathways: An Application in Oncology.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer may progress through multiple treatments with differing adverse effect profiles. Moreover, pathways may be fixed or flexible in allowing for escalation or de-escalation of treatment depending on interim outcomes. We sought to develop a methodology capable of estimating preferences for the entirety of a pathway involving a sequence of different treatments. METHODS: Patients with early breast cancer completed an online discrete choice experiment to assess preferences for eight key early breast cancer attributes. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling was used to calculate attribute-level preference weights. Preference weights for hypothetical pathways were estimated by summing the respective weights for efficacy, flexible or fixed pathway, duration, administration regimen, and adverse event risk, the last two of which were time-adjusted by multiplying each weight by the proportion of time spent on a selected treatment. RESULTS: Increases in the risk of a serious adverse event were most influential in treatment pathway preferences, followed by increases in efficacy and decreases in overall pathway duration. Patients preferred a flexible pathway versus a fixed pathway. Pathway preference estimates fluctuated in a logically consistent manner. Switching from a flexible to a fixed pathway yielded a significantly lower pathway preference. For this same pathway, when adjuvant treatment was replaced with a treatment with a more favorable toxicity profile and shorter duration, it offset the negative impact of the more toxic neoadjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This novel methodology accounts for patient preference throughout a sequence of treatments, allowing for comparison of preferences across complex treatment pathways.",1
Denosumab versus pamidronate in the treatment of osteolytic bone metastases secondary to breast cancer: a multi-institutional analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and most often metastasizes to the bone, resulting in skeletal-related events (SREs). Bone-modifying agents (BMAs) including denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-b ligand (RANKL), and pamidronate, a bisphosphonate, are used to prevent these adverse events. METHODS: To analyze the efficacy of denosumab versus pamidronate, we used the TriNetX research platform and compared the outcomes of pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, and overall 5-year survival rate between each pharmacotherapy. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference for an increased risk in pathological fractures (2.7% vs. 2.8%, P = 0.88), spinal cord compression (2.6% vs. 2.7%, P = 0.88), or 5-year survival rate (45.5% vs. 52.4%, P = 0.78) for the denosumab cohort versus the pamidronate cohort. CONCLUSION: Since neither therapy showed an increased risk in the adverse effects measured in this study, factors such as patient preference, financial costs, and additional side effects of each medication should be taken into consideration when choosing a therapy for bone metastases in patients with breast cancer.",0
The impact of parent treatment preference and other factors on recruitment: lessons learned from a paediatric epilepsy randomised controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: In paediatric epilepsy, the evidence of effectiveness of antiseizure treatment is inconclusive for some types of epilepsy. As with other paediatric clinical trials, researchers undertaking paediatric epilepsy clinical trials face a range of challenges that may compromise external validity MAIN BODY: In this paper, we critically reflect upon the factors which impacted recruitment to the pilot phase of a phase IV unblinded, randomised controlled 3×2 factorial trial examining the effectiveness of two antiseizure medications (ASMs) and a sleep behaviour intervention in children with Rolandic epilepsy. We consider the processes established to support recruitment, public and patient involvement and engagement (PPIE), site induction, our oversight of recruitment targets and figures, and the actions we took to help us understand why we failed to recruit sufficient children to continue to the substantive trial phase. The key lessons learned were about parent preference, children's involvement and collaboration in decision-making, potential and alternative trial designs, and elicitation of stated preferences pre-trial design. Despite pre-funding PPIE during the trial design phase, we failed to anticipate the scale of parental treatment preference for or against antiseizure medication (ASMs) and consequent unwillingness to be randomised. Future studies should ensure more detailed and in-depth consultation to ascertain parent and/or patient preferences. More intense engagement with parents and children exploring their ideas about treatment preferences could, perhaps, have helped predict some recruitment issues. Infrequent seizures or screening children close to natural remission were possible explanations for non-consent. It is possible some clinicians were unintentionally unable to convey clinical equipoise influencing parental decision against participation. We wanted children to be involved in decisions about trial participation. However, despite having tailored written and video information to explain the trial to children we do not know whether these materials were viewed in each consent conversation or how much input children had towards parents' decisions to participate. Novel methods such as parent/patient preference trials and/or discrete choice experiments may be the way forward. CONCLUSION: The importance of diligent consultation, the consideration of novel methods such as parent/patient preference trials and/or discrete choice experiments in studies examining the effectiveness of ASMs versus no-ASMs cannot be overemphasised even in the presence of widespread clinician equipoise.",0
An innovative approach to recruiting participants for dementia research: primary care and researcher perspectives.,"Aim: To describe clinician and researcher perceptions of a new, patient preference focused approach to recruiting patients for research from primary care-based memory clinics. Methods: Memory clinic clinicians completed a survey and key informants completed an individual interview to gather their perceptions of this new program. Results: The majority of clinicians were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with this recruitment approach and indicated that this approach would have minimal negative impact on patient care or create conflict of interest. Key informants valued the program for its patient-centred approach, the integration of research into care and potential for increased recruitment. Discussion: These findings are suggestive of support for this recruitment approach. Pilot testing will inform feasibility, effectiveness and process improvements.",0
Acceptability and Preference for Human Papilloma Virus Self-Sampling among Thai Women Attending National Cancer Institute.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer screening is an important public health strategy to reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling is the alternative method that can potentially increase participation in cervical cancer screening. This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability of HPV self-sampling as a primary cervical cancer screening among Thai women. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at National Cancer Institute, Thailand, between March and September 2021. Eligible women were invited to collect their own samples with a vaginal cotton swab for cervical screening. The data on demographics, acceptability, and preference for HPV self-sampling were collected via a self-administered questionnaire. A Likert scale was used to assess the response of self-sampling acceptability. The multivariable logistic regression determined factors that influence preference for HPV self-sampling. RESULTS: A total of 265 participants were recruited. Over 70% agreed that self-sampling was easy, less embarrassing, and not painful. They also felt confident in their ability to self-sample correctly and would recommend this method to a friend or relative. For their next screening round, 66.4% preferred self-sampling whereas 33.6% preferred clinician-collected samples as routine screening. The factors that influence preference for self-sampling were age, marital status, feeling less embarrassed, and confidence in performing the tests. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the study participants accepted HPV self-sampling. This suggests that the self-sampling method will be an additional option to increase cervical cancer screening coverage which leads to improving the effectiveness of the national program.",0
Patient preferences for epilepsy treatment: a systematic review of discrete choice experimental studies.,"BACKGROUND: This review aimed to 1) identify and assess the quality of discrete choice experiments (DCEs) examining preferences related to epilepsy treatment; 2) summarize the attributes and attribute levels measured in these studies; 3) identify how researchers selected and developed these attributes; and 4) identify which attributes are most important for epilepsy patients. METHODS: A systematic literature review using PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases from database inception to February or April 2022. We included primary discrete-choice experiments eliciting preferences for various attributes of pharmacological and surgical interventions in patients diagnosed with epilepsy or the parents/carers of children with epilepsy. We excluded non- primary studies, studies assessing preferences for nonpharmacological treatment and studies that elicit preferences using methods other than discrete choice experiments. Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of studies. The quality of the included studies was assessed using two validated checklists. Study characteristics and findings were summarized descriptively. RESULTS: A total of seven studies were included in the review. The majority of studies explored patients' preferences, and two compared the preferences of patients with physicians. The majority (n = 6) compared two medications, and one compared two surgical options to continuing medication options. The studies examined 44 attributes in total, including side effects (n = 26), efficacy expressed as being seizure free or have fewer seizures (n = 8), costs (n = 3), dosing frequency (n = 3), duration of side effects (n = 2), mortality (n = 1), long-term problems after surgery (n = 1) and surgical options (n = 1). The findings indicate that people with epilepsy have strong preferences for improving seizure control, which was ranked as the top priority in all studies. Patients also have a strong preference for the reduction of adverse effects and may be willing to make trade-offs between improved seizure control and reduction of long-term side effects that may impact their quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The use of DCEs in measuring patients' preference for epilepsy treatment is accumulating. However, inadequate reporting of methodological details may reduce decision-makers' confidence in the findings. Suggestions for future research are provided.",1
Racial and ethnic disparities in end-of-life care for patients with oesophageal cancer: death trends over time.,"BACKGROUND: Given significant morbidity and mortality associated with oesophageal cancer, supportive, high-quality end-of-life care is critical. Most patients with advanced cancer prefer to die at home, but incongruence between preferred and actual place of death is common. Here, we examined trends and disparities in location of death among patients with oesophageal cancer. METHODS: Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Range Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database, we utilized multinomial logistic regression to assess associations between sociodemographic characteristics and location of death for patients with oesophageal cancer (n = 237,063). Additionally, we utilized linear regression models to evaluate the significance of changes in location of death trends over time and disparities in the relative change in location of death trends across sociodemographic groups. FINDINGS: From 2003 to 2019, there was a decrease of deaths in hospitals, nursing homes, and outpatient medical facilities/emergency departments and an increase of deaths at home and in hospice. Relative to White decedents, Black and Asian decedents were less likely to die at home (relative risk ratio (RRR): 0.58 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-0.60], RRR: 0.57 [95% CI: 0.53-0.61]) and in hospice (RRR: 0.67 [95% CI: 0.64-0.71], RRR: 0.49 [95% CI: 0.43-0.55]) when compared to the hospital. Similar disparities were noted for American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) decedents. These disparities persisted even upon stratifying by the number of listed causes of death, a proxy for severity of illness. Time trend analysis indicated that increases in deaths in hospice over time occurred at a slower rate for AIAN and Asian decedents relative to White decedents. INTERPRETATION: 2 in 5 patients with oesophageal cancer die at home, with an increasing proportion dying at home and in hospice-in line with general patient preferences. However, location of death disparities have largely persisted over time among racial and ethnic minority groups. Our findings suggest the importance of improving access to advance care planning and delivering tailored, person-centred interventions. FUNDING: None.",0
"General-practitioner-led alcohol and other drugs withdrawal: Supporting patient choice, safety and success.","BACKGROUND: Alcohol or other drug (AOD) withdrawal is a common reason for patients to seek treatment. Ambulatory, or 'home-based', AOD withdrawal for patients who are low risk is a useful intervention for general practitioners (GPs) to help empower their patients to improve their health and make meaningful change to their AOD use. OBJECTIVE: This article explores the themes of patient choice, safety and optimising success in GP-led withdrawal. The four-step framework of 'who', 'prepare', 'withdrawal' and 'follow-up' outlines how to best support patients in the general practice setting to undertake a withdrawal. DISCUSSION: There are many benefits to a GP-led, home-based AOD withdrawal. The strategies to facilitate choice and safety and to optimise withdrawal success described in the article include careful patient selection, preparing the patient using domains of whole-person care, clarifying the patient's goals and stage of change, support during withdrawal and fostering long-term treatment in general practice.",0
Respiratory Management of Patients With Neuromuscular Weakness: An American College of Chest Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline and Expert Panel Report.,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory failure is a significant concern in neuromuscular diseases (NMDs). This CHEST guideline examines the literature on the respiratory management of patients with NMD to provide evidence-based recommendations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An expert panel conducted a systematic review addressing the respiratory management of NMD and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence and formulating and grading recommendations. A modified Delphi technique was used to reach a consensus on the recommendations. RESULTS: Based on 128 studies, the panel generated 15 graded recommendations, one good practice statement, and one consensus-based statement. INTERPRETATION: Evidence of best practices for respiratory management in NMD is limited and is based primarily on observational data in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The panel found that pulmonary function testing every 6 months may be beneficial and may be used to initiate noninvasive ventilation (NIV) when clinically indicated. An individualized approach to NIV settings may benefit patients with chronic respiratory failure and sleep-disordered breathing related to NMD. When resources allow, polysomnography or overnight oximetry can help to guide the initiation of NIV. The panel provided guidelines for mouthpiece ventilation, transition to home mechanical ventilation, salivary secretion management, and airway clearance therapies. The guideline panel emphasizes that NMD pathologic characteristics represent a diverse group of disorders with differing rates of decline in lung function. The clinician's role is to add evaluation at the bedside to shared decision-making with patients and families, including respect for patient preferences and treatment goals, considerations of quality of life, and appropriate use of available resources in decision-making.",0
"Dissemination and implementation of clinical practice guidelines: a longitudinal, mixed-methods evaluation of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care's knowledge translation efforts.","BACKGROUND: The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (task force) develops evidence-based preventive health care guidelines and knowledge translation (KT) tools to facilitate guideline dissemination and implementation. We aimed to determine practitioners' awareness of task force guidelines and KT tools and explore barriers and facilitators to their use. METHODS: The task force's KT team completed annual evaluations using surveys and interviews with primary care providers in Canada from 2014 to 2020, to assess practitioners' awareness and determinants of use of task force guidelines and tools. We transcribed interviews verbatim and double-coded them using a framework analysis approach. RESULTS: A total of 1284 primary care practitioners completed surveys and 183 participated in interviews. On average, 79.9% of participants were aware of the task force's 7 cancer screening guidelines, 36.2% were aware of the other 6 screening guidelines and 18.6% were aware of the 3 lifestyle or prevention guidelines. Participants identified 13 barriers and 7 facilitators to guideline and KT tool implementation; these were consistent over time. Participants identified strategies at the public and patient, provider and health systems levels to improve uptake of guidelines. INTERPRETATION: Canadian primary care practitioners were more aware of task force cancer screening guidelines than its other preventive health guidelines. Over the 6-year period, participants consistently reported barriers to guideline uptake, including misalignment with patient preferences and other provincial or specialty guideline organizations. Further evaluations will assess tailored strategies to address the barriers identified.",0
Nongovernmental organizations supporting the HIV service delivery response in Africa - an engine for innovation.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are pivotal to the HIV response, supporting access to HIV services since the start of the epidemic. Against the backdrop of the impact of NGOs, is the recognition of the unique role that local NGOs bring to the HIV response, drawing from their deep understanding of the context and knowledge of local health problems. RECENT FINDINGS: The Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ) is one such NGO. Through various implementation science research and programs, CIDRZ has supported the Zambian government's HIV response. As Zambia moves closer to epidemic control, understanding reasons for patient disengagement from care and patient preferences for HIV care demonstrated by CIDRZ have contributed to global and national HIV treatment and care guidelines. SUMMARY: This paper offers a case study for how NGOs like CIDRZ can serve as health system-wide catalyst to identify, integrate, and scale up evidence-based practices for HIV prevention, care, and treatment. It draws from the public health literature, CIDRZ extensive program and research experience and implementation science theory, to illustrate key strategies that can be deployed by local NGOs to spark innovation, quality improvement, and support governments to achieve and sustain HIV epidemic control.",0
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), one of the most common causes of liver disease, is an increasingly common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several demographic, clinical, and genetic factors contribute to HCC risk in NAFLD patients, which may inform risk stratification scores. Proven efficacious approaches to primary prevention approach in patients with non-viral liver disease remain an area of need. Semi-annual surveillance is associated with improved early tumor detection and reduced HCC-related mortality; however, patients with NAFLD have several challenges to effective surveillance, including under-recognition of at-risk patients, low surveillance utilization in clinical practice, and lower sensitivity of current tools for early-stage HCC detection. Treatment decisions are best made in a multidisciplinary fashion and are informed by several factors including tumor burden, liver dysfunction, performance status, and patient preferences. Although patients with NAFLD often have larger tumor burden and increased comorbidities compared to counterparts, they can achieve similar post-treatment survival with careful patient selection. Therefore, surgical therapies continue to provide a curative treatment option for patients diagnosed at an early stage. Although there has been debate about the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with NAFLD, current data are insufficient to change treatment selection based on liver disease etiology.",0
Prioritizing Treatment Goals of People Diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder in the US: Best-Worst Scaling Results.,"PURPOSE: Bipolar I disorder (BP-I) is associated with significant disease burden, but evidence on treatment goals in people diagnosed with BP-I is scarce. This study sought to quantify treatment goals related to the pharmacological management of BP-I in adults in the US and to identify if subgroups of people with similar treatment goals exist. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A best-worst scaling (BWS) of treatment goals was developed based on available literature and input from experts and patients and was distributed as part of a survey between August and September 2021. Survey participants were adults with a self-reported diagnosis of BP-I who were recruited via an online panel in the US. Participants were asked to prioritize the importance of 16 treatment goals using BWS. BWS scores were computed using multinomial logistic regression, with the scores across all goals summing to 100 for each participant. Subgroups of people with similar preferences were identified using latent class analysis. RESULTS: The most important treatment goals for people diagnosed with BP-I (N=255) were ""being less impulsive, angry, or irritable"" (score: 9.73), or being ""able to feel pleasure or happiness"" (score: 9.54). Goals related to reducing the incidence of various potential adverse events of medication (scores: ≤4.51) or ""reducing dependence on others"" (score: 3.04) were less important. Two subgroups were identified. One subgroup (n=111) prioritized symptom-focused goals, considering ""reducing frequency of mania, depression, and mixed episodes"" and ""being less impulsive, angry or irritable"" the most important (scores: 12.46 and 11.85, respectively). The other subgroup (n=144) placed significantly more importance on social functioning-focused goals, including beginning or maintaining a relationship with a partner/significant other, and with family and/or friends (scores: 8.45 and 7.70, respectively). CONCLUSION: People diagnosed with BP-I prioritized emotional improvements. Subgroups of people with BP-I prioritized either symptom-focused or social functioning-focused treatment goals.",1
Trends in the size of treated unruptured intracranial aneurysms over 35 years.,"OBJECTIVE: In the absence of clear guidelines and consistent natural history data, the decision to treat unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) is a matter of some controversy. Currently, decisions are often guided by a consensus of cerebrovascular specialist teams and patient preferences. It is unclear how paradigm-shifting developments in the detection and treatment of UIAs have affected the size of the UIAs that are selected for treatment. Herein, the authors aimed to study potential changes in the average size of the UIAs that were treated over time. They hypothesized that the average size of UIAs that are treated is decreasing over time. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was performed to identify all studies describing the size of UIAs that were treated using any modality. Scatter diagrams with trend lines were used to plot the size of the aneurysms treated over time and assess for the presence of a potentially significant trend via statistical correlation tests. Subgroup analyses based on type of treatment, country of study, and specialty of the authors were performed. RESULTS: A total of 240 studies including 35,150 UIAs treated between 1987 and 2021 met all eligibility criteria and were entered in the analysis. The mean age of patients was 55.5 years, and 70.7% of the patients were females. There was a significant decrease in the size of treated UIAs over time (Spearman's r = -0.186, p < 0.001), with a 0.71-mm decrease in the average size of treated UIAs every 5 years since 1987 and an annual mean dropping below 7 mm in 2012. This decreasing trend was present in surgically and endovascularly treated UIAs (p < 0.001 for both), in more developed and developing countries (p < 0.001 for both), within neurosurgical and non-neurosurgical specialties (p < 0.001 for both), most prominently in the US (Spearman's r = -0.482, p < 0.001), and less prominently in Europe (Spearman's r = -0.221, p < 0.001) and was not detected in East Asia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that based on the treated UIA size data published in the literature over the past 35 years, smaller UIAs are being treated over time. This trend is likely driven by safer treatments. However, future studies should elucidate the cost-effectiveness of treating smaller UIAs as well as the possible real-world contribution of this trend in preventing aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.",0
A novel framework for incorporating patient values and preferences in making guideline recommendations: guideline panel surveys.,"OBJECTIVE: Universally acknowledged standards for trustworthy guidelines include the necessity to ground recommendations in patient values and preferences. When information is limited-which is typically the case-guideline panels often find it difficult to explicitly integrate patient values and preferences into their recommendations. Our objective was to develop and evaluate a framework for systematically navigating guideline panels in incorporating patient values and preferences in making recommendations. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In the context of developing a guideline for colorectal cancer screening, we generated an initial framework for creating panel surveys to elicit guideline panelists' views of patient values and preferences and to inform panel discussions on recommendations. With further applications in guidelines of diverse topic areas, we dynamically refined the framework through iterative discussions and consensus. RESULTS: The finial framework consists of five steps for creating and implementing panel surveys. The surveys can serve three objectives following from the quantitative information regarding patient values and preferences that guideline panels usually require. An accompanying video provides detailed instructions of the survey. CONCLUSION: The framework for creating and implementing panel surveys offers explicit guidance for guideline panels considering transparently and systematically incorporating patient values and preferences into guideline recommendations.",0
Infliximab vs adalimumab: Points to consider when selecting anti-tumor necrosis factor agents in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease.,"Biologic agents with various mechanisms against Crohn's disease (CD) have been released and are widely used in clinical practice. However, two anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADL), are the only biologic agents approved by the Food and Drug Administration for pediatric CD currently. Therefore, in pediatric CD, the choice of biologic agents should be made more carefully to achieve the therapeutic goal. There are currently no head-to-head trials of biologic agents in pediatric or adult CD. There is a lack of accumulated data for pediatric CD, which requires the extrapolation of adult data for the positioning of biologics in pediatric CD. From a pharmacokinetic point of view, IFX is more advantageous than ADL when the inflammatory burden is high, and ADL is expected to be advantageous over IFX in sustaining remission in the maintenance phase. Additionally, we reviewed the safety profile, immunogenicity, preference, and compliance between IFX and ADL and provide practical insights into the choice of anti-TNF therapy in pediatric CD. Careful evaluation of clinical indications and disease behavior is essential when prescribing anti-TNF agents. In addition, factors such as the efficacy of induction and maintenance of remission, safety profile, immunogenicity, patient preference, and compliance play an important role in evaluating and selecting treatment options.",0
Utilization of Hospital Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders in Older Adults During COVID-19 Surges in 2020.,"Background: Reports of poor outcomes among older adults with COVID-19 may have changed patient perceptions of Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) orders or caused providers to pressure older adults into accepting DNR orders to conserve resources. Objective: We determined early-DNR utilization during COVID-19 surges compared with nonsurge periods among nonsurgical adults ≥75 and its connection to hospital mortality. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among adults ≥75 years using the California Patient Discharge Database 2020. The primary outcome was early-DNR utilization. Control cohorts included nonsurgical adults <75 years in 2020 and nonsurgical adults ≥75 in 2019. Multiple causal inference methods were used to address measured and unmeasured confounding. Results: A total of 487,955 adults ≥75 years were identified, with 233,678 admitted during COVID-19 surges. Older adults admitted during surges had higher rates of early-DNR orders (30.1% vs. 29.4%, absolute risk differences = 0.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5-1.0) even after adjusting for patient case-mix (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.04). Patients with early-DNR orders experienced higher hospital mortality (15.5% vs. 4.8%, aOR = 3.96, 95% CI: 3.85-4.06). Difference-in-difference analyses demonstrated that adults <75 years in 2020 and adults ≥75 years in 2019 did not experience variation in early-DNR utilization. Conclusions: Older adults had slightly higher rates of early-DNR orders during COVID-19 surges compared with nonsurge periods. While the difference in early-DNR utilization was small, it was linked to higher odds of death. The increase in early-DNR use only during COVID-19 surges and only among older adults may reflect changes in patient preferences or increased pressure on older adults stemming from provider fears of rationing during COVID-19 surges.",0
Management of mixed urinary incontinence: IUGA committee opinion.,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) is defined by the International Urogynecology Association (IUGA) and International Continence Society as the complaint of involuntary leakage of urine associated with urgency and also with exertion, effort, sneezing or coughing. It therefore implies the coexistence of both stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI). MUI is a heterogeneous diagnosis that requires an assessment of its individual components of SUI and UUI. Management requires an individualised approach to the symptom components. The aim of this review is to identify the assessment/investigations and management options for MUI. METHODS: A working subcommittee from the IUGA Research & Development (R&D) Committee was created and volunteers invited from the IUGA membership. A literature review was performed to provide guidance focused on the recommended assessment and management of MUI. The document was then evaluated by the entire IUGA R&D Committee and IUGA Board of Directors and revisions made. The final document represents the IUGA R&D Committee Opinion. RESULTS: The R&D Committee MUI opinion paper provides guidance on the assessment and management of women with MUI and summarises the evidence-based recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Mixed urinary incontinence is a complex problem and successful management requires alleviation of both the stress and urge components. Care should be individualised based on patient preferences. Further research is needed to guide patients in setting goals and to determine which component of MUI to treat first. The evidence for many of the surgical/procedural treatment options for MUI are limited and needs to be explored in more detail.",0
Patients' preferences for systemic treatment of atopic dermatitis: safety and efficacy count the most.,"BACKGROUND: The advent of biologics and janus kinase inhibitors has revolutionized treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate preferences of patients with AD for attributes of currently approved systemic treatments and assess influencing factors. METHODS: An online discrete choice experiment was conducted in patients with AD throughout Germany to analyze preferences for outcome (probability of (almost) clear skin at week 16, probability of significant itch improvement, time to onset of itch relief and type of side effects) and process attributes (application method and frequency of laboratory tests). RESULTS: Participants (n = 182, 75.3% female) considered side effects (Relative Importance Score (RIS): 31.2), (almost) clear skin (RIS: 24.2) and probability of itch improvement (RIS: 16.0) most important. Application method (RIS: 14.4), time to onset of itch relief (RIS: 7.4) and frequency of laboratory tests (RIS: 6.8) were less relevant. Preferences were significantly influenced by sex, age, psychiatric comorbidity, current therapy and health-related quality of life according to multivariate regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Participants attached great importance to safety and symptom control. However, preferences were also dependent on individual characteristics, underscoring the importance of personal counseling. Conjoined with medical considerations, patients' preferences have fundamental impact on shared decisions for treatment of AD.",1
Patient experiences of undergoing abortion with and without an ultrasound scan in Britain.,"BACKGROUND: Routine ultrasound scanning to determine gestational age and pregnancy location has long been part of pre-abortion assessment in Britain, despite not being legally required or recommended in national clinical guidelines. To support implementation of fully telemedical abortion care (implemented in Britain in April 2020), the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) issued clinical guidance for an 'as-indicated' approach to pre-abortion ultrasound, removing the need for a clinic visit. We aimed to understand patient experiences of ultrasound in abortion care by conducting a qualitative study with individuals who had abortions with and without an ultrasound scan. METHODS: Between November 2021 and July 2022, we recruited patients who had a medical abortion at home without a pre-procedure ultrasound at 69 days' gestation or less at British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), and also had at least one other abortion with an ultrasound from any provider in Britain. We conducted interviews using a semi-structured interview guide to explore our participants' experiences and conducted reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: We recruited 24 participants and included 19 interviews in our analysis. We developed three themes from our data. These were 'Ultrasound scans and their relationship with autonomy and decision-making', 'Intrusive and out of place: the ultrasound as an inappropriate technology' and 'Towards preference-centred, quality care'. CONCLUSIONS: Further research and user-testing of strategies to improve the scan experience should be undertaken. Patient testimonies on the negative impact of ultrasound scans in abortion care should reassure providers that omitting them according to patient preference is a positive step towards providing patient-centred care.",0
Limb salvage versus primary amputation in Gustilo-Anderson IIIB and IIIC tibial fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: The last systematic review on this topic was published in 2008. With advances in surgical techniques, patients with mangled extremities may now be potentially salvageable with comparable outcomes. This review aims to evaluate the outcomes of limb salvage compared to primary amputation in patients with severe open tibial fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search on PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, CENTRAL and CINAHL was performed from inception to 19 January 2022. The primary outcome was to evaluate clinical and functional outcomes. Secondary outcomes were to evaluate pain, patient preference, quality of life, and patient preferences. Methodological quality was evaluated using the MINORS criteria. Pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used as a summary statistic for dichotomous variables and continuous variables, respectively. RESULTS: Sixteen studies with 645 patients met inclusion criteria. The methodological quality was moderate based on the MINORS score. The majority were male. Mean age was 36.3 years. There was no significant differences in the length of hospitalization (n = 8), return to work rates (n = 9), return to sport rates (n = 4) and quality of life scores (n = 4). Patients with primary amputation had a significantly lower risk of total complications (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.08-0.53, p = 0.001) (n = 10), infections (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.85, p = 0.01) (n = 9), and number of surgeries (MD - 4.17, 95% CI - 6.49 to - 1.85, p = 0.0004) (n = 6). Patients with primary amputation were able to ambulate significantly earlier (MD - 4.06, 95% CI - 7.65 to - 0.46, p = 0.03) (n = 3). Three studies found a significantly higher cost of hospitalization in limb salvage patients. Functional outcomes were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: While patients with primary amputation had better clinical outcomes in the short-term, functional outcomes were not significantly different in both groups. Despite the heterogenicity of the results in this review, surgeons need to contextualize the decision making for their patients and incorporate these findings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

Patients' and informal caregivers' perspectives on self-management interventions for type 2 diabetes mellitus outcomes: a mixed-methods overview of 14 years of reviews.,"BACKGROUND: Self-management interventions (SMIs) are core components of high-quality care in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to identify and summarise the scientific evidence exploring the perspectives of patients with T2DM and their informal caregivers on outcomes of SMIs, and the key themes to enhance T2DM patient-centred care. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods overview of reviews. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, up to June 2021 for systematic reviews (SRs) exploring the perspectives of adults with T2DM and their informal caregivers, regarding self-management. Two reviewers conducted independently study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. We estimated the degree of overlap across SRs. We performed a qualitative analysis using a thematic synthesis approach. RESULTS: We identified 54 SRs, corresponding to 939 studies, with a slight overlap. Most SRs (47/54, 87%) were considered high quality. We developed summaries for 22 outcomes and identified six overarching themes: (1) diabetic identity; (2) accessing healthcare; (3) experience of care; (4) engagement with self-management; (5) outcomes awareness; and (6) challenges adhering to self-management. We found important variability in how patients with T2DM and their informal caregivers value critical outcomes influenced by the disease progression and several contextual factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings represent what matters most to patients with T2DM and their informal caregivers regarding outcomes of SMIs. Our results can facilitate the development and evaluation of SMIs, and guide decision-making in diabetes care, including the formulation of decisions and recommendations.",0
Consumer preferences for telehealth in Australia: A discrete choice experiment.,"This study aims to elicit consumer preferences regarding telehealth and face-to-face consultations in Australia. It used a discrete choice experiment, presenting participants with a series of hypothetical choices, and based on their responses, infer what is most important to them. Data were analysed using conditional logit regression and latent class analysis. A total of 1,025 participants completed the survey, considering four different clinical scenarios. Face-to-face contacts were, on average, preferred to either telephone or video services. However, telehealth was identified as an attractive option if it prevents significant travel and can be conducted with a familiar doctor. Participants were strongly driven by cost, particularly greater than $30. Telehealth was least preferred for situations involving a new and unknown physical symptom, and relatively more preferred for surgical follow-up. The latent class analysis demonstrates only 15.9% of participants appeared unwilling to consider telehealth. The findings of this study suggest that meeting the needs of the Australian population requires a blended approach to service delivery, with telehealth being valued in a range of clinical scenarios. Price sensitivity was evident, therefore if telehealth services can be delivered with lower patient cost, then they are likely to be attractive.",1
Preferences Regarding Breast Surgery Omission Among Patients With Breast Cancer Who Receive Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Currently, several ongoing prospective studies are investigating the safety of breast surgery omission in patients with breast cancer who are exceptional responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, there is little information about the preferences of these patients regarding omission of breast surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a questionnaire survey to assess preferences regarding omission of breast surgery among patients with breast cancer who had human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive or estrogen receptor-negative tumors and good clinical response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients' estimation of the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after definitive surgery or breast surgery omission was also assessed. RESULTS: Of 93 patients, only 22 (23.7%) said they would omit breast surgery. Under the scenario of omitting breast surgery, the 5-year IBTR rate estimated by patients who said they would omit breast surgery was significantly lower (median, 10%) than the rate estimated by patients who preferred undergoing definitive surgery (median, 30%) (p=0.017). CONCLUSION: The proportion of our surveyed patients who were willing to omit breast surgery was low. Patients who said they preferred to omit breast surgery overestimated the 5-year IBTR risk.",1
Treatment Patterns of Cancer-associated Thrombosis in the Netherlands: The Four Cities Study.,"Background  Current guidelines recommend either low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as first-line treatment in cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE). Aim  This study aimed to investigate treatment regimens for cancer-associated VTE over the past 5 years, explore predictors for initial treatment (LMWH vs. DOAC), and to assess the risks of recurrent VTE and bleeding. Methods  This was a Dutch, multicenter, retrospective cohort study including consecutive patients with cancer-associated VTE between 2017 and 2021. Treatment predictors were assessed with multivariable logistic regression models. Six-month cumulative incidences for recurrent VTE and major bleeding (MB) were estimated with death as competing risk. Results  In total, 1,215 patients were included. The majority (1,134/1,192; 95%) started VTE treatment with anticoagulation: 561 LMWH (47%), 510 DOACs (43%), 27 vitamin K antagonist (2.3%), and 36 other/unknown type (3.0%). The proportion of patients primarily treated with DOACs increased from 18% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12-25) in 2017 to 70% (95% CI 62-78) in 2021. Poor performance status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.99) and distant metastases (aOR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.82) were associated with primary treatment with LMWH. Total 6-month cumulative incidences were 6.0% (95% CI 4.8-7.5) for recurrent VTE and 7.0% (95% CI 5.7-8.6) for MB. During follow-up, 182 patients (15%) switched from LMWH to a DOAC, and 54 patients (4.4%) vice versa, for various reasons, including patient preference, recurrent thrombosis, and/or bleeding. Conclusion  DOAC use in cancer-associated VTE has increased rapidly over the past years. Changes in anticoagulation regimen were frequent over time, and were often related to recurrent thrombotic and bleeding complications, illustrating the complexity and challenges of managing cancer-associated VTE.",0
ANALYSIS THE RESULTS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT AND EARLY REHABILITATION OF PATIENTS WITH MASSIVE TEARS THE ROTATOR CUFF THE SHOULDER.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the treatment outcomes in patients who underwent arthroscopic repair of large and massive rotator cuff tears and underwent rehabilitation at different stages of the recovery process. The clinical study group consisted of 88 patients, with an age range of 47 to 68 years (mean age 52,7±9,5 years). All patients underwent a double-row repair of the rotator cuff tendons and tenodesis or tenotomy of the long head of the biceps tendon under arthroscopic guidance. The results were assessed using the Constant Shoulder Score and the Oxford Shoulder Score scales at 6 and 12 months after the surgery. A total of 88 patients were selected, with 50 patients in the main group (MG) who had a 6-week immobilization period. The control group (CG) consisted of 38 patients who had a shortened immobilization period of 3-4 weeks due to patient preference or recommendations from other rehabilitation centers where patients underwent rehabilitation. Shoulder immobilization was performed using a standard sling with a triangular pillow and a 15° abduction angle in the shoulder joint. Following the surgeon's recommendation, all patients were offered a rehabilitation program consisting of three periods: immobilization (0-6 weeks), functional (6-12 weeks), and training (>12 weeks) periods. Comparative analysis of the treatment results using the Oxford Shoulder Score scale showed that significantly better results were obtained in the MG patients (41,5±2,1 points) compared to the CG patients (34,2±3,6 points) at 6,2±1,2 months (p˂0.05). Comparative analysis of the treatment results using the Oxford Shoulder Score scale at 12,2±1,3 months showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the MG and CG results (MG - 44,5±2,2 and CG - 42,4±3, p>0,05). Similarly, according to the Constant Shoulder Score scale, better results were observed in the MG both at 6 months and 12 months after the surgery (excellent in 82% of MG vs 36.8% in CG, good in 18% of MG vs 57.9% in CG, respectively). Thus, in the short term, early activation of the operated joint leads to delayed healing of the operated tissues and worsening of joint function, as confirmed by the comparative analysis of the examined groups. Significant advantages of prolonged immobilization (at least 6 weeks) were found in short-term observation (up to 6 months), and no differences in functional outcomes were observed in the long term during the follow-up at 12 months.",0
Statement of the Spanish Interdisciplinary Vascular Prevention Committee on the updated European Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention.,"We present the Spanish adaptation of the 2021 European Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) prevention in clinical practice. The current guidelines besides the individual approach greatly emphasize on the importance of population level approaches to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Systematic global CVD risk assessment is recommended in individuals with any major vascular risk factor. Regarding LDL-Cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus, goals and targets remain as recommended in previous guidelines. However, it is proposed a new, stepwise approach (Step 1 and 2) to treatment intensification as a tool to help physicians and patients pursue these targets in a way that fits patient profile. After Step 1, considering proceeding to the intensified goals of Step 2 is mandatory, and this intensification will be based on 10-year CVD risk, lifetime CVD risk and treatment benefit, comorbidities and patient preferences. The updated SCORE algorithm-SCORE2, SCORE-OP- is recommended in these guidelines, which estimates an individual's 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke) in healthy men and women aged 40-89 years. Another new and important recommendation is the use of different categories of risk according different age groups (< 50, 50-69, ≥70 years). Different flow charts of CVD risk and risk factor treatment in apparently healthy persons, in patients with established atherosclerotic CVD, and in diabetic patients are recommended. Patients with chronic kidney disease are considered high risk or very high-risk patients according to the levels of glomerular filtration rate and albumin-to-creatinine ratio. New lifestyle recommendations adapted to the ones published by the Spanish Ministry of Health as well as recommendations focused on the management of lipids, blood pressure, diabetes and chronic renal failure are included.",0
Medication Abortion Follow-Up Rates in a Rural Population Before and After Introduction of a Remote Follow-Up Option.,"Background: Medication abortion (MAB) follow-up historically involves visiting a health care facility for ultrasonography or laboratory testing. In rural states such as New Mexico, many patients travel hours for MAB, making two visits burdensome. Studies demonstrate feasibility, safety, and patient preference for remote follow-up. Materials and Methods: We evaluated whether MAB follow-up by telephone had noninferior loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) rates compared with ultrasonography or laboratory follow-up in a rural population. This was a retrospective chart review of University of New Mexico MAB LTFU rates after changing to telephone follow-up (home group, n = 136). Patients were propensity-matched in a 1:2 ratio to a historical cohort (health care group, n = 272) to eliminate significant differences. We defined LTFU as no contact within 50 days. We evaluated complications requiring intervention, possible ongoing pregnancy, completion of the home follow-up protocol (7- and 30-day calls, high-sensitivity urine pregnancy test [UPT]), follow-up by intended method (home or health care), and number of call attempts. Results: LTFU rates for the home group (n = 23, 17%) were noninferior to the health care group (n = 60, 22%, p = 0.24). Rates of complications requiring intervention (p = 0.83) and possible ongoing pregnancy (p = 0.72) among the home group were similar to the health care group. Ninety-seven (71%) home group patients completed the initial call, 79 (58%) completed the UPT, and 86 (69%) completed the 30-day call. Ninety-five (70%) home group patients followed up by intended method, comparable with the health care group (n = 199, 73%, p = 0.56). Staff made a median of 3 (interquartile range: 2-4) calls per home group patient. Conclusions: Remote MAB LTFU rates were noninferior to in-person LTFU rates.",0
Patients' preferences in dental care: A discrete-choice experiment and an analysis of willingness-to-pay.,"INTRODUCTION: Dental diseases are a major problem worldwide. Costs are a burden on healthcare systems and patients. Missed treatments can have health and financial consequences. Compared to other health services, dental treatments are only covered in parts by statutory health insurance (SHI). Using the example of dental crowns for a cost-intensive treatment, our study aims to investigate whether (1) certain treatment attributes determine patients' treatment choice, and (2) out-of-pocket payments represent a barrier to access dental care. METHODS: We conducted a discrete-choice-experiment by mailing questionnaires to 10,752 people in Germany. In presented scenarios the participants could choose between treatment options (A, B, or none) composed of treatment attribute levels (e.g., color of teeth) for posterior (PT) and anterior teeth (AT). Considering interaction effects, we used a D-efficient fractional factorial design. Choice analysis was performed using different models. Furthermore, we analyzed willingness-to-pay (WTP), preference of choosing no and SHI standard care treatment, and influence of socioeconomic characteristics on individual WTP. RESULTS: Out of n = 762 returned questionnaires (response rate of r = 7.1), n = 380 were included in the analysis. Most of the participants are in age group ""50 to 59 years"" (n = 103, 27.1%) and female (n = 249, 65.5%). The participants' benefit allocations varied across treatment attributes. Aesthetics and durability of dental crowns play most important roles in decision-making. WTP regarding natural color teeth is higher than standard SHI out-of-pocket payment. Estimations for AT dominate. For both tooth areas, ""no treatment"" was a frequent choice (PT: 25.7%, AT: 37.2%). Especially for AT, treatment beyond SHI standard care was often chosen (49.8%, PT: 31.3%). Age, gender, and incentive measures (bonus booklet) influenced WTP per participant. CONCLUSION: This study provides important insights into patient preferences for dental crown treatment in Germany. For our participants, aesthetic for AT and PT as well as out-of-pocket payments for PT play an important role in decision-making. Overall, they are willing to pay more than the current out-of-pockt payments for what they consider to be better crown treatments. Findings may be valuable for policy makers in developing measures that better match patient preferences.",1
Willingness to provide informal care to older adults in Germany: a discrete choice experiment.,"As the German population is continually aging and the majority of older adults still wish to 'age in place', the need for informal care provided by family and friends will correspondingly continue to increase. In addition, while the need for formal (professional) care services is also likely to increase, the supply already does not meet the demand in Germany today. The aim of our study is the elicitation of people's willingness to provide informal care by means of a discrete choice experiment. The self-complete postal survey was disseminated to a random sample of the German general population in Lower Saxony. Data cleansing resulted in a final sample size of 280 participants. A conditional logit and a latent class model were estimated. All attributes were judged as highly relevant by the respondents. The results revealed that an increase in the care hours per day had the greatest negative impact overall on the willingness to provide informal care in our sample. The marginal willingness-to-accept for 1 h of informal care was €14.54 when having to provide informal care for 8 h in reference to 2 h per day. This value is considerably higher than the national minimum wage of €9.82. A three-class latent class model revealed preference heterogeneity. While a monetary compensation is often discussed to increase the willingness and availability of informal care in a country, our results show that this statement could not be generalized within our entire sample.",1
[Treatment of actinic keratoses in older adults].,"Actinic keratoses (AKs) are common precancerous skin lesions that primarily affect older adults due to cumulative sun exposure. Given the increased vulnerability of older adults to developing AKs, appropriate therapeutic strategies are crucial to prevent their progression to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. This comprehensive review aims to explore the various treatment modalities available for AKs in the elderly population, focusing on their efficacy, safety, and suitability for this specific age group. The article discusses topical treatments, cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy, chemical peels, and surgical interventions, providing a detailed analysis of their mechanisms of action, benefits, limitations, and considerations in geriatric patients. Furthermore, the importance of individualized treatment plans, considering factors such as comorbidities, medication interactions, and patient preferences, are highlighted.",0
"Discrete-Choice Experiment to Understand the Preferences of Patients with Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer in the USA, Canada, and the UK.","BACKGROUND: Treatment options for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) have broadened, and treatment decisions can have a long-lasting impact on patients' quality of life. Data on patient preferences can improve therapeutic decision-making by helping physicians suggest treatments that align with patients' values and needs. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to quantify patient preferences for attributes of chemohormonal therapies among patients with mHSPC in the USA, Canada, and the UK. METHODS: A discrete-choice experiment survey instrument was developed and administered to patients with high- and very-high-risk localized prostate cancer and mHSPC. Patients chose between baseline androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) alone and experimentally designed, hypothetical treatment alternatives representing chemohormonal therapies. Choices were analyzed using logit models to derive the relative importance of attributes for each country and to evaluate differences and similarities among patients across countries. RESULTS: A total of 550 respondents completed the survey (USA, 200; Canada, 200; UK, 150); the mean age of respondents was 64.3 years. Treatment choices revealed that patients were most concerned with treatment efficacy. However, treatment-related convenience factors, such as route of drug administration and frequency of monitoring visits, were as important as some treatment-related side effects, such as skin rash, nausea, and fatigue. Patient preferences across countries were similar, although patients in Canada appeared to be more affected by concomitant steroid use. CONCLUSION: Patients with mHSPC believe the use of ADT alone is insufficient when more effective treatments are available. Efficacy is the most significant driver of patient choices. Treatment-related convenience factors can be as important as safety concerns for patients.",1
Great expectations: patients' preferences for clinically significant results from genomic sequencing.,"We aimed to describe patient preferences for a broad range of secondary findings (SF) from genomic sequencing (GS) and factors driving preferences. We assessed preference data within a trial of the Genomics ADvISER, (SF decision aid) among adult cancer patients. Participants could choose from five categories of SF: (1) medically actionable; (2) polygenic risks; (3) rare diseases; (4) early-onset neurological diseases; and (5) carrier status. We analyzed preferences using descriptive statistics and drivers of preferences using multivariable logistic regression models. The 133 participants were predominantly European (74%) or East Asian or mixed ancestry (13%), female (90%), and aged > 50 years old (60%). The majority chose to receive SF. 97% (129/133) chose actionable findings with 36% (48/133) choosing all 5 categories. Despite the lack of medical actionability, participants were interested in receiving SF of polygenic risks (74%), carrier status (75%), rare diseases (59%), and early-onset neurologic diseases (53%). Older participants were more likely to be interested in receiving results for early-onset neurological diseases, while those exhibiting lower decisional conflict were more likely to select all categories. Our results highlight a disconnect between cancer patient preferences and professional guidelines on SF, such as ACMG's recommendations to only return medically actionable secondary findings. In addition to clinical evidence, future guidelines should incorporate patient preferences.",0
Patient preferences for pilonidal sinus treatments: a discrete choice experiment survey.,"BACKGROUND: A range of treatments are available for pilonidal sinus disease (PSD), each of which has a different risk/benefit profile. The aim of this study was to collect patient views on which interventions they would rather avoid and which outcomes they most value for PSD. METHOD: We conducted an online survey using the discrete choice experiment (DCE) method. DCE task involved participants choosing the best treatment option when presented with a set of competing hypothetical treatment profiles. Participants with symptomatic PSD, referred for elective surgery were recruited from 33 NHS trusts between 2020 and 2022. Collected DCE data were analysed using regression analyses. RESULTS: One hundred and eleven participants completed the survey. In the overall group, low risk of infection/persistence was the most important characteristic when making a treatment decision (attribute importance score of 70%), followed by treatments with shorter recovery time with an attribute importance score of 30%. The results demonstrated that patients are willing to accept trade-offs between treatment recovery time and risk of infection/persistence. Patients above 30 years old are willing to accept a higher chance of treatment failure in exchange for rapid treatment recovery (risk tolerance between 22.35 - 34.67 percentage points). Conversely, patients in the younger age groups, were risk averse, and were only willing to accept a small risk 1.51-2.15 in exchange for a treatment with faster recovery time. All patient groups appear to the reject the excision and leave open technique due to the need for protracted nursing care. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the need for shared decision making when it comes to surgery for PSD.",1
Research recruitment and consent methods in a pandemic: a qualitative study of COVID-19 patients' perspectives.,"BACKGROUND: Virtual data collection methods and consent procedures adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic enabled continued research activities, but also introduced concerns about equity, inclusivity, representation, and privacy. Recent studies have explored these issues from institutional and researcher perspectives, but there is a need to explore patient perspectives and preferences. This study aims to explore COVID-19 patients' perspectives about research recruitment and consent for research studies about COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory qualitative focus group and interview study among British Columbian adults who self-identified as having had COVID-19. We recruited participants through personal contacts, social media, and REACH BC, an online platform that connects researchers and patients in British Columbia. We analyzed transcripts inductively and developed thematic summaries of each coding element. RESULTS: Of the 22 individuals recruited, 16 attended a focus group or interview. We found that autonomy and the feasibility of participation, attitudes toward research about COVID-19, and privacy concerns are key factors that influence participants' willingness to participate in research. We also found that participants preferred remote and virtual approaches for contact, consent, and delivery of research on COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who had COVID-19 are motivated to participate in research studies and value autonomy in their decision to participate, but researchers must be sensitive and considerate toward patient preferences and concerns, particularly as researchers adopt virtual recruitment and data collection methods. Such awareness may increase research participation and engagement.",0
Treatment Preferences in Young Adults with Moderate to Severe Psoriasis: A Qualitative Study from the Nordic Countries.,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to explore treatment preferences and identify patient characteristics in young bio-naive adults with moderate to severe psoriasis in the Nordic countries (Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Denmark). METHODS: Patients were 18-45 years old and bio-naive but referred for biologic treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. Patients were included at eight Nordic dermatology clinics. Patients with significant comorbidity or psoriatic arthritis were excluded. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) were assessed along with basic patient information. A semistructured interview guide was used in individual qualitative interviews, asking patients about their treatment preferences and reasons, disease journey, and disease management. The interviews were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Twenty-four patients sufficed to reach saturation in this qualitative study. RESULTS: The patient sample characteristics represented a qualitative variation in age, sex, symptoms, duration of disease, and country. We included a total of 12 male and 12 female patients. The mean age was 34 years (range 18-45 years), the mean age at diagnosis was 20 years (range 6-34 years), the mean ± standard deviation (SD) time since diagnosis was 13 ± 8 years, PASI was 9.5 ± 4.7, and DLQI was 15.2 ± 6.4. Interviews suggested that both the burden of disease as well as the burden of treatment influenced patient preferences regarding treatment attributes, hence getting alleviation from symptoms did not alone influence patient preferences. Time, effort, and inconvenience related to psoriasis treatments also influenced patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: This first in-depth, qualitative study in young bio-naive adults with psoriasis suggests that patient preferences are focusing not only on symptom relief but also on alleviating the burden of psoriasis treatment. Understanding the reasons for patient preferences and the perspectives of young adults is needed to guide individual shared decision-making in psoriasis management.",1
[Do clothes make the psychiatrist? Psychiatrists and patients on psychiatrists' dress style and form of address].,"BACKGROUND: Both the way a psychiatrist dresses and the way he gets addressed can have an impact on the therapeutic relationship. Most psychiatrists have stopped wearing white coats and dress less formally than before. AIM: To identify psychiatrists&rsquo; and patients&rsquo; preferences regarding psychiatrists&rsquo; style of dress and form of address. To test if certain styles of dress are linked to competence or accessibility. METHODS: A total of 143 respondents, of which 35 psychiatrists and 108 patients, filled out structured questionnaires with pictures. RESULTS: Psychiatrists, and both minor and adult patients, preferred psychiatrists to dress formally while elderly patients prefer them to wear white coats. The formal dress style and white coat were perceived as more competent than the informal style. Psychiatrists thought a white coat is regarded less accessible than a formal dress style and a formal dress style less accessible than an informal one. Adult patients regarded a white coat as less accessible than formal and informal dress styles. In elderly and minor patients no differences were seen in perceived accessibility for the three dress styles. Both psychiatrists and patients preferred a psychiatrist to be addressed with &lsquo;doctor&rsquo; and a patient with his/her first name. CONCLUSIONS: It seems a good choice for a psychiatrist to go formally dressed, let them be addressed by their title, and address patients by their first name.",0
Patient Preferences for Investigating Cancer-Related Symptoms in Australian General Practice: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Striking the right balance between early cancer diagnosis and the risk of excessive testing for low-risk symptoms is of paramount importance. Patient-centred care must also consider patient preferences for testing. AIM: To investigate diagnostic testing preferences of the Australian public for symptoms associated with oesophagogastric (OG), bowel, or lung cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: One of three discrete choice experiments (DCEs) related to either OG, bowel, or lung cancer were administered to a nationally representative sample of Australians aged 40 and above. METHODS: Each DCE comprised three scenarios with symptom positive predictive values (PPVs) for undiagnosed cancer ranging from 1% to 3%. The numerical risk was concealed from participants. DCE attributes encompassed the testing strategy, GP familiarity, test and result waiting times, travel duration, and test cost. Preferences were estimated using conditional and mixed logit models. RESULTS: A total of 3013 individuals participated in one of three DCEs: OG (n=1004), Bowel (n=1006), and Lung (n=1003). Preferences were chiefly driven by waiting time, test cost followed by the test type. There was preference for more invasive tests. When confronted with symptoms carrying an extremely low risk (symptom PPV of 1% or less), participants were more inclined to abstain from testing. CONCLUSIONS: Access-related factors, particularly waiting times and testing costs, emerged as the most pivotal elements influencing preferences, underscoring the substantial impact of these systemic factors on patient choices regarding investigations.",1
Preference for primary care in Chinese homebound patients.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the preference for primary healthcare (PHC) and investigate associated factors among homebound residents in both rural and urban areas of China. It provides valuable insights to facilitate the rational allocation of healthcare resources and promote the utilization of PHC. METHODS: In this nationally representative cross-sectional study, we utilized the most recent data (2020) from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). Participants were recruited from 25 provincial-level administrative regions in both rural and urban areas of China. Homebound patients were asked to provide details about their individual characteristics, variables related to family caregiving, and preferences for PHC. Multivariable logistic models were used to analyze potential factors associated with preference for PHC. Estimates of association were reported as odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The study found that 58.43% of rural patients reported a preference for PHC, while 42.78% of urban patients favored PHC. Compared to rural participants who did not received inpatient care in the past year, those who received inpatient care in the past year had 67% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR:0.33, 95% CI:0.19-0.59); Compared to rural participants who did not received family caregiving when ill, those who received family caregiving when ill had 59% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.41, 95% CI:0.21-0.77). Correspondingly, Compared to urban participants who did not received inpatient care in the past year, those who had received inpatient care in the past year had 75% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.10-0.56); Compared to urban participants who did not received family caregiving when ill, those who received family caregiving when ill had 73% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.11-0.63); Compared to urban participants who with agricultural Hukou, those with Non-agricultural Hukou had 61% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.39, 95% CI:0.18-0.83); Compared to urban participants living in the eastern part of mainland China, those living in the central part of China had 188% higher odds of choosing PHC (OR: 2.88, 95% CI: 1.14-7.29). CONCLUSION: Policymakers should focus on tailoring PHC to vulnerable populations and prioritizing family-based public health strategies for enhancing homebound patients' perceptions of PHC. Furthermore, further study is needed on whether the Hukou registration system affects the barriers that homebound patients experience in choosing healthcare providers.",0

[Analysis of the experience and procedural complications of trans-radial access versus trans-femoral access for hepatic arterial perfusion chemotherapy in patients with advanced hepatic malignancies:a retrospective study].,"Objective: To analyze the differences between trans-radial access (TRA) and trans-femoral access (TFA) in hepatic arterial perfusion chemotherapy (HAIC) in terms of patient experience, postoperative complications, and patient preferences; explore whether TRA in HAIC is associated with better patient experience and compliance; and determine whether it is safer than TFA. Methods: The study was a retrospective cohort study of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastases from colorectal cancer treated with HAIC. We enrolled a total of 91 patients with advanced liver malignancies treated with HAIC from November 2022 to May 2023 in the Department of Interventional Therapy and Hepatobiliary Medicine at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital. The patients were divided into three groups: group TRA (n=20, receiving TRA HAIC only), group TFA (n=33, receiving TFA HAIC only), and crossover group [n=19, receiving TFA HAIC (Cross-TFA group) first, followed by TRA HAIC (Cross-TRA group)]. Meanwhile, to facilitate the expression of partial results, all patients receiving TRA HAIC were defined as the TRA-HAIC group (n=39, TRA+Cross-TRA group), and all patients receiving TFA HAIC were defined as the TFA-HAIC group (n=52, TFA+Cross-TFA group). The primary research index was the Quality of Life (QOL) visualization scale score. The secondary research index included approach-related and catheter-related adverse events, duration of surgery, and mean length of patient stay. We used various statistical methods such as Mann-Whitney U test, t-test, Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, univariate logistic regression analysis, and multi-factor analysis. Results: TRA patients had significantly lower QOL scores than TFA patients (all P<0.001). The QOL scores of the Cross-TRA group were significantly lower than those of the Cross-TFA group (pain at the puncture site Z=-3.24, P=0.001, others P<0.001). The QOL scores of the Cross-TRA group were compared with those of the TRA group, which showed that the scores of the Cross-TRA group in overall discomfort (Z=-3.07,P=0.002), postoperative toilet difficulty (Z=-2.12, P=0.034), and walking difficulty (Z=-2.58, P=0.010) were significantly lower than those of the TRA group. Satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the Cross-TRA group than in the Cross-TFA group (Z=-3.78, P<0.001), and patients were more likely to receive TRA HAIC as the next procedure (χ(2)=30.42, P<0.001). In terms of mean length of stay, patients receiving TRA HAIC had a significantly lower mean length of stay than those receiving TFA HAIC (50.1±3.2 h vs. 58.4±6.4 h, t=7.98, P<0.001). The incidence of radial artery occlusion (RAO) as an approach-related adverse event was 15.4% (6/39) in the TRA-HAIC group, which was significantly higher than that in the TFA-HAIC group (15.4% vs. 0, χ(2)=8.56, P=0.005). Notably, multifactorial analysis of RAO-related factors showed that intraoperative enoxaparin use and patency of radial artery flow during pressure were significantly associated with a reduced risk of postoperative RAO (P=0.037 for enoxaparin use and P=0.049 for pressure). Conclusions: With respect to procedure approach, TRA was significantly better than TFA in terms of patient satisfaction and mean length of stay. Through further process optimization and prevention of adverse reactions, the incidence of adverse reactions can be maintained at a relatively low level, so that patients can benefit from TRA in future operations in terms of cost-effectiveness and medical efficiency.",0
"""Shared decision-making"" for prostate cancer screening: Is it a marker of quality preventative healthcare?","BACKGROUND: ""Shared decision-making"" (SDM) is a cornerstone of prostate cancer (PCa) screening guidelines due to tradeoffs between clinical benefits and concerns for over-diagnosis and over-treatment. SDM requires effort by primary-care-providers (PCP) in an often busy clinical setting to understand patient preferences with the backdrop of patient risk factors. We hypothesized that SDM for PCa screening, given its prominence in guidelines and practical challenges, may be associated with quality preventative healthcare in terms of other appropriate cancer screening and encouragement of other preventative health behaviors. METHODS: From the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, 50-75 year old men who underwent PSA screening were assessed for their participation in SDM, PCa and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, and other preventative health behaviors, like vaccination, exercise, and smoking status. Adjusted odds ratio of likelihood of PSA testing as a function of SDM was calculated. Likelihoods of SDM and PSA testing as a function of preventative health behaviors were also calculated. RESULTS: Screening rates were 62 % for PCa and 88 % for CRC. Rates of SDM were 39.1 % in those with PSA screening, and 16.2 % in those without. Odds of PSA screening were higher when SDM was present (AOR = 2.68). History of colonoscopy was associated with higher odds of SDM (AOR = 1.16) and PSA testing (AOR = 1.94). Health behaviors, like regular exercise, were associated with increased odds of SDM (AOR = 1.14) and PSA testing (AOR = 1.28). History of flu vaccination (AOR = 1.29) and pneumonia vaccination (AOR = 1.19) were associated with higher odds of SDM. Those who received the flu vaccine were also more likely to have PSA testing (AOR = 1.36). Smoking was negatively associated with SDM (AOR = 0.86) and PSA testing (AOR = 0.93). Older age was associated with higher rates of PSA screening (AOR = 1.03, CI = 1.03-1.03). Black men were more likely than white men to have SDM (AOR = 1.6, CI = 1.59 - 1.6) and decreased odds of PSA testing (AOR = 0.94, CI = 0.94 - 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: SDM was associated with higher odds of PSA screening, CRC screening, and other appropriate preventative health behaviors. Racial disparities exist in both SDM and PSA screening usage. SDM may be a trackable metric that can lead to wider preference-sensitive care and improved preventative care.",0

Preferences of Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease for Invasive Versus Conservative Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"Background Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can experience acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with high morbidity and mortality. Early invasive management of ACS is recommended for most high-risk patients; however, choosing between an early invasive versus conservative management approach may be influenced by the unique risk of kidney failure for patients with CKD. Methods and Results This discrete choice experiment measured the preferences of patients with CKD for future cardiovascular events versus acute kidney injury and kidney failure following invasive heart procedures for ACS. The discrete choice experiment, consisting of 8 choice tasks, was administered to adult patients attending 2 CKD clinics in Calgary, Alberta. The part-worth utilities of each attribute were determined using multinomial logit models, and preference heterogeneity was explored using latent class analysis. A total of 140 patients completed the discrete choice experiment. The mean age of patients was 64 years, 52% were male, and mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 37 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). Across the range of levels, risk of mortality was the most important attribute, followed by risk of end-stage kidney disease and risk of recurrent myocardial infarction. Latent class analysis identified 2 distinct preference groups. The largest group included 115 (83%) patients, who placed the greatest value on treatment benefits and expressed the strongest preference for reducing mortality. A second group of 25 (17%) patients was identified who were procedure averse and had a strong preference toward conservative management of ACS and avoiding acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. Conclusions The preferences of most patients with CKD for management of ACS were most influenced by lowering mortality. However, a distinct subgroup of patients was strongly averse to invasive management. This highlights the importance of clarifying patient preferences to ensure treatment decisions are aligned with patient values.",1
Current status and prospect for future advancements of long-acting antibody formulations.,"INTRODUCTION: Biologics, especially monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), have become a major class of therapeutics in recent years addressing the needs of millions of patients and becoming one of the best-selling treatments in the pharmaceutical market. A wide range of multifaceted chronic diseases have benefitted from antibody therapeutics. Long-term treatment for chronic diseases with mAb therapies can mean a lifetime of frequent injections. Technologies that can minimize the total number of injections present meaningful value to patients and the companies that develop them. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the challenges encountered during the development of long-acting versions of mAbs. The focus will be on questions addressed during drug product development, delivery device selection, business implications, and understanding the market potential of long-acting presentations. EXPERT OPINION: Long-acting drug delivery systems have reached the market for small molecules and peptides. However, these drug delivery systems, and their development lessons, cannot be extrapolated directly to antibodies. We must develop new delivery technologies suitable for biologics, identify critical attributes to capture dynamic changes in proteins during the encapsulation process, and develop analytical processes to evaluate long-term stability.",0
Pharmacists' perspectives on recommending herbal medicines for acute infections: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Community pharmacists have an essential role in antimicrobial stewardship by providing self-care advice for self-limiting infections. AIM: To explore community pharmacists' perceptions and experiences of advising patients on management of acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and urinary tract infections (UTIs), and to explore issues regarding use of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, including herbal medicines. DESIGN & SETTING: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with community pharmacists in England. METHOD: Qualitative interviews with community pharmacists were carried out face to face and by telephone between November 2019 and March 2020. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews, recorded and transcribed. A reflexive thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: In total, 18 community pharmacists were interviewed. Three main themes were identified. Theme 1 was self-management recommendations. Community pharmacists considered patients' preferences when recommending self-management strategies. Some believed that conventional OTC medications had quicker and stronger effects, while others preferred herbal OTCs as a more natural approach, particularly for less severe symptoms. Theme 2 was factors influencing pharmacists' recommendations for acute infections. This included pharmacists' perceptions of patient preferences, nature or severity of illness, research evidence, training, commercial pressures, and patient concerns about medication cost. Theme 3 was pharmacist-patient communication. Pharmacists sometimes experienced challenges with language barriers and patients' expectations of receiving antibiotics. Pharmacists emphasised the importance of being trusted by their patients. There was widespread acceptance of their role in self-management advice for acute illness and interest in the role of herbal medicines, but pharmacists did not feel confident in recommending these. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists are central to the management of self-limiting infections. There is a need to educate the public about appropriate use of antibiotics and provide training and support for pharmacists on self-management strategies including herbal medicine.",0
Perinatal mental health and COVID-19: Navigating a way forward.,"The COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath have increased pre-existing inequalities and risk factors for mental disorders in general, but perinatal mental disorders are of particular concern. They are already underdiagnosed and undertreated, and this has been magnified by the pandemic. Access to services (both psychiatric and obstetric) has been reduced, and in-person contact has been restricted because of the increased risks. Rates of perinatal anxiety and depressive symptoms have increased. In the face of these challenges, clear guidance in perinatal mental health is needed for patients and clinicians. However, a systematic search of the available resources showed only a small amount of guidance from a few countries, with a focus on the acute phase of the pandemic rather than the challenges of new variants and variable rates of infection. Telepsychiatry offers advantages during times of restricted social contact and also as an additional route for accessing a wide range of digital technologies. While there is a strong evidence base for general telepsychiatry, the particular issues in perinatal mental health need further examination. Clinicians will need expertise and training to navigate a hybrid model, flexibly combining in person and remote assessments according to risk, clinical need and individual patient preferences. There are also wider issues of care planning in the context of varying infection rates, restrictions and vaccination access in different countries. Clinicians will need to focus on prevention, treatment, risk assessment and symptom monitoring, but there will also need to be an urgent and coordinated focus on guidance and planning across all organisations involved in perinatal mental health care.",0
Primary prevention of cancer-associated venous thrombosis: Rationale and challenges in clinical practice.,"Cancer-associated venous thrombosis (CAT) is a common, multifactor event known to complicate the course of cancer and jeopardize a patient's prognosis. The current guidelines regarding the prevention of CAT are sometimes considered insufficiently precise about specific situations, or are poorly applied. The expected benefits of thromboprophylaxis are balanced by the risk of major bleeding induced by anticoagulation, which implies a need to accurately identify ambulatory patients at high risk of thrombosis or hemorrhage. The Khorana score is commonly used for this, but is limited by the non-reproducibility of predicted performance across cancer types, and by the fact that antitumor treatment and cardiovascular risks are not included. The COMPASS-CAT score, which includes those two aspects, was found to be a more accurate predictor of venous thromboembolism in patients with lung cancer, and to better distinguish between patients at low or high risk of thrombosis. The frailty of patients with cancer is also a major issue, and should be taken into account when thromboprophylaxis is considered. According to current guidelines, CAT prophylaxis should be considered for hospitalized patients, those for whom surgery is scheduled, or those with pancreatic cancers. In ambulatory patients, decisions should be made according to patient, cancer and antitumoral treatment characteristics. Low molecular weight heparin is the gold standard of CAT prophylaxis. Despite increased risks of bleeding or drug-drug interactions in cancer patients, direct oral anticoagulants could be alternate options for high-risk ambulatory patients that should be accompanied by a careful global analysis of benefits, harms, and patient preferences.",0
Nursing leadership to facilitate patient participation in fundamental care: An ethnographic qualitative study.,"AIMS: To explore and describe hospital nurses' perceptions of leadership behaviours in facilitating patient participation in fundamental care. DESIGN: An ethnographic interview study. METHODS: Individual semi-structured interviews with 12 nurses with a bachelor's or master's degree working at a university medical centre were conducted between February and April 2021. The interview data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Six themes were derived from the data: (1) nursing leadership; (2) patient participation; (3) using patients' preferences; (4) building relationships; (5) task-focused nursing; (6) need for role modelling. CONCLUSION: Nurses indicated leadership behaviour to facilitate patient participation in fundamental care as inviting patients to participate and eliciting and supporting patients' preferences. Although nurses also regarded leadership as motivating colleagues to act and enhancing evidence-based practice, they appeared not to practise this themselves about patient participation. Role modelling was indicated as a need for improvement. IMPACT: The findings established that not all leadership behaviours mentioned were used in practice about patient participation in fundamental care. Role modelling and the use of evidence-based practice are needed to increase patient participation. Further research will be necessary to develop and test leadership interventions to improve patient participation in fundamental care.",0
Early safety and efficacy comparison of endoscopic bariatric interventions.,"BACKGROUND: Intragastric balloon (IGB) placement and endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) are the 2 primary endoscopic bariatric therapies currently performed in the United States. Procedural selection is often based primarily on patient preference. There is a paucity of comparative data between these interventions. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to compare the short-term safety and efficacy of IGB to ESG in the largest, direct comparative analysis to date. SETTING: Accredited bariatric centers across the United States and Canada. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent IGB or ESG from 2016 to 2020 from the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program database. IGB patients were propensity matched (1:1) to ESG patients. We compared readmissions, reinterventions, serious adverse events (SAE), weight loss, procedure time, and length of stay between the 2 interventions. All outcomes were measured within 30 days of the initial procedure. RESULTS: A total of 1998 pairs of patients who underwent IGB and ESG were propensity matched with no difference in baseline characteristics. Patients who underwent ESG had more readmissions within 30 days. Patients who underwent IGB had more outpatient treatments for dehydration and re-interventions, with 3.7% of patients undergoing early balloon removal less than 30 days from implantation. Both procedures had similarly low rates of SAE (P > .05). ESG led to greater total body weight loss at 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: ESG and IGB are both safe procedures with comparably low rates of SAE. Higher rates of dehydration and re-interventions after IGB suggest that ESG is perhaps better tolerated.",0
Comparison of a validated decision-support tool to a standard of care triage system for knee osteoarthritis assessment: a proof-of-concept study.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) in northwestern Ontario are referred by their primary care provider (PCP) to a centralized assessment clinic for evaluation by an advanced practice physiotherapist (APP) to determine if they will require surgical management. However, many patients are found to not require surgical management, resulting in delays for patients who do. A decision-support tool was developed to address this issue and to guide treatment options by determining the need for surgical or nonsurgical approaches. METHODS: We used a proof-of-concept method to assess the use of the decision-support tool in northwestern Ontario. Data from 100 consecutive patients assessed for knee OA management were collected from the Thunder Bay centralized assessment clinic. Two levels of agreement analyses (calculated using Cohen κ statistic) were performed, between the APP assessment decision (surgical or non-surgical) and the decision-support tool recommendation, and between the surgeon's decision (surgical or non-surgical) and the decision-support tool recommendation. RESULTS: We found a near-perfect agreement (κ = 0.870, n = 65) between the APP decision and the decision-support tool recommendation, when controlled for patient preference. There was a substantial level of agreement (κ = 0.618, n = 72) between the decision-support tool recommendation and the surgeon's decision. CONCLUSION: The decision-support tool recommendation showed considerable agreement with the decisions of the APP and surgeon indicating that it could be a valuable tool to guide PCPs caring for patients with knee OA. The applicability of a decision-support tool in northwestern Ontario displayed promising results, but further research is needed to examine the feasibility in a primary care setting.",0
Gene Therapy for Hemophilia A: A Mixed Methods Study of Patient Preferences and Shared Decision-Making.,"PURPOSE: As gene therapies for hemophilia are incorporated into clinical practice, shared decision-making (SDM) is recommended for implementation. SDM tools may facilitate informed decision-making for gene therapy and other novel therapies. OBJECTIVE: To inform the development of SDM tools for hemophilia gene therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Men with severe hemophilia were recruited from the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) Community Voices in Research (CVR). Semi-structured interviews were completed, and the interviews were transcribed verbatim for quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-five men with severe hemophilia A participated. All participants reported treatment with prophylaxis, nine (36%) on continuous prophylaxis with clotting factor, one (4%) on intermittent prophylaxis with clotting factor, and 15 (60%) on continuous prophylaxis with emicizumab. Ten (40%) indicated that they are excited about gene therapy, 12 (48%) indicated that they are hopeful about gene therapy, one (4%) indicated that they are worried or scared about gene therapy, and one (4%) indicated that they do not have strong feelings about gene therapy. Participants reported engaging Hemophilia Treatment Center, family, and the hemophilia community in their decision-making process. The most reported information needs are efficacy, safety, cost/insurance, mechanism of action, and follow-up. In addition, key information themes that emerged were patient testimonials, hard data and statistics, and comparison to other products. Twenty-two (88%) indicated that a SDM tool would be useful when discussing gene therapy with their hemophilia team. Two indicated that they do their own research, and the tool would not add anything. One needed more information to provide an answer. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the utility of a SDM tool for hemophilia gene therapy and key information needs. Data including comparison to other treatments should be provided along with patient testimonials in a transparent format. Patients will engage the Hemophilia Treatment Center, family, and community members in the decision-making process.",0
Elevated end-of-life spending: A new measure of potentially wasteful health care spending at the end of life.,"OBJECTIVE: To construct a new measure of end-of-life (EoL) spending-the elevated EoL spending-and examine its associations with measures of quality of care and patient and physician preferences in comparison with the commonly used total Medicare EoL spending measures. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING: Medicare claims data for a 20% random sample of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients, from the health care quality data for 2015-2016, from the Hospital Compare and the Medicare Geographic Variation public use file, and survey data about patient and physician preferences. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed the elevated EoL spending measure as the differential monthly spending between decedents and survivors with the same one-year mortality risk, where the risk was predicted using machine learning models. We then examined the associations of the hospital referral region (HRR)-level elevated EoL spending with various health care quality measures and with the survey-elicited patient and provider preferences. We also examined analogous associations for monthly total EoL spending on decedents. DATA EXTRACTION METHODS: Medicare FFS patients who were continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A & B in 2015 and were alive as of January 1, 2016. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found a large variation in the elevated EoL spending across HRRs in the United States. There was no evidence of an association between HRR-level elevated EoL spending and established health care quality measures, including those specific to EoL care, whereas total EoL spending was positively associated with certain quality of care measures. We also found no evidence that elevated EoL spending was associated with patient preferences for EoL care. However, elevated EoL spending was positively and significantly associated with physician preferences for treatment intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that elevated EoL spending captures different resource use from conventional measures of EoL spending and may be more valuable in identifying potentially wasteful spending.",0
Scar Ectopic Pregnancy as an Uncommon Site of Ectopic Pregnancy: A Case Report and Literature Review.,"A cesarean scar pregnancy is a rare type of ectopic pregnancy that occurs when a fertilized egg implants in the scar from a previous cesarean section. It is a serious condition that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality if not managed promptly and appropriately. In this literature review and case report, we discuss the etiology, diagnosis, and management of cesarean scar pregnancy. We conducted a comprehensive search of relevant literature using electronic databases and included studies that reported on the diagnosis and management of cesarean scar pregnancy. We also present a case report of a patient with cesarean scar pregnancy who was managed surgically. The diagnosis of cesarean scar pregnancy is primarily done via transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound, and medical or surgical management can be used depending on the gestational age, hemodynamic status, and patient preferences. The surgical approach, which involves hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, or laparotomy, is usually preferred, since it is associated with fast recovery and lower recurrence rates. However, it is crucial to consider the patient's plans for future fertility when selecting the management approach. In conclusion, cesarean scar pregnancy is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt and appropriate management. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent significant morbidity and mortality, and surgical management is usually preferred due to its higher success rates and lower recurrence rates.",0
Group sequential two-stage preference designs.,"The two-stage preference design (TSPD) enables inference for treatment efficacy while allowing for incorporation of patient preference to treatment. It can provide unbiased estimates for selection and preference effects, where a selection effect occurs when patients who prefer one treatment respond differently than those who prefer another, and a preference effect is the difference in response caused by an interaction between the patient's preference and the actual treatment they receive. One potential barrier to adopting TSPD in practice, however, is the relatively large sample size required to estimate selection and preference effects with sufficient power. To address this concern, we propose a group sequential two-stage preference design (GS-TSPD), which combines TSPD with sequential monitoring for early stopping. In the GS-TSPD, pre-planned sequential monitoring allows investigators to conduct repeated hypothesis tests on accumulated data prior to full enrollment to assess study eligibility for early trial termination without inflating type I error rates. Thus, the procedure allows investigators to terminate the study when there is sufficient evidence of treatment, selection, or preference effects during an interim analysis, thereby reducing the design resource in expectation. To formalize such a procedure, we verify the independent increments assumption for testing the selection and preference effects and apply group sequential stopping boundaries from the approximate sequential density functions. Simulations are then conducted to investigate the operating characteristics of our proposed GS-TSPD compared to the traditional TSPD. We demonstrate the applicability of the design using a study of Hepatitis C treatment modality.",0
"Association of Race, Ethnicity, Insurance, and Language and Rate of Breast-Conserving Therapy Among Women With Nonmetastatic Breast Cancer at an Urban, Safety-Net Hospital.","INTRODUCTION: Breast-conserving therapy (BCT), specifically breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and adjuvant radiation, provides an equivalent alternative to mastectomy for eligible patients. However, previous studies have shown that BCT is underused in the United States, particularly among marginalized demographic groups. In this study, we examine the association between race, ethnicity, insurance, and language and rate of BCS among patients treated at an academic, safety-net hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 520 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer diagnosed and treated at an academic, safety-net hospital (2009-2014). We assessed eligibility for BCT and then differences in the rate of BCT among eligible patients by race, ethnicity, insurance, and language. Reasons for not undergoing BCT were documented. RESULTS: Median age was 60 y; 55.9% were non-White, 31.9% were non-English-speaking, 15.6% were Hispanic, and 47.4% were Medicaid/uninsured. Three hundred seventy one (86.3%) underwent BCS; within this group, 324 (87.3%) completed adjuvant radiation. Among patients undergoing mastectomy, 30 patients (36.7%) were eligible for BCT; within this group, reasons for mastectomy included patient preference (n = 28) and to avoid possible re-excision or adjuvant radiation in patients with significant comorbidities (n = 2). Eligibility for BCT varied by ethnicity (Hispanic [100%], Non-Hispanic [92%], P = 0.02), but not race, language, or insurance. Among eligible patients, rate of BCS varied by age (<50 y [84.9%], ≥50 y [92.9%], P = 0.01) and ethnicity (Hispanic [98.5%], Non-Hispanic [91.3%], P = 0.04), but not race, language, or insurance. CONCLUSIONS: At our safety-net hospital, the rate of BCS among eligible patients did not vary by race, language, or insurance. Excluding two highly comorbid patients, all patients who underwent mastectomy despite being eligible for BCT were counseled regarding BCS and expressed a preference for mastectomy. Further research is needed to understand the value of BCT in the treatment of breast cancer, to ensure informed decision-making, address potential misconceptions regarding BCT, and advance equitable care for all patients.",0
"Access to device-aided therapies in advanced Parkinson's disease: navigating clinician biases, patient preference, and prognostic uncertainty.","Device-aided therapies (DAT), which include deep brain stimulation and pump-based continuous dopaminergic stimulation with either levodopa or apomorphine, are among the major advances in the clinical management of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although DAT are being increasingly offered earlier in the disease course, their classical indication remains advanced PD. Theoretically, every patient should be offered transition to DAT when faced with refractory motor and nonmotor fluctuations and functional decline. Worldwide clinical reality is far from these ideal, and, therefore, question the ""real-world"" equal opportunity of access to DAT for PD patients with advanced PD-even within a single health care system. Differences in access to care, referral pattern (timing and frequency), as well as physician biases (unconscious/implicit or conscious/explicit bias), and patients' preferences or health-seeking behaviour are to be considered. Compared to DBS, little information is available concerning infusion therapies, as well as neurologists' and patients' attitudes towards them. This viewpoint aims to be thought-provoking and to assist clinicians in moving through the process of DAT selection, by including in their decision algorithm their own biases, patient perspective, ethical concerns as well as the current unknowns surrounding PD prognosis and DAT-related long-term side effects for a given patient.",0
Patient Preferences for Adjuvant Treatment in Muscle-Invasive Urothelial Carcinoma: A Multi-Country Discrete Choice Experiment.,"PURPOSE: The evolving treatment landscape in muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma creates challenges for clinicians and patients in selecting the most appropriate therapy. Here, we aimed to understand adjuvant treatment preferences among patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma who underwent radical resection, including tradeoffs between efficacy outcomes and toxicity risks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional study utilizing a discrete choice experiment was conducted across the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Germany via a web-based survey. Patients ≥18 years of age who self-reported as having been diagnosed with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma were included. Patients indicated their preferences between hypothetical treatment profiles varying in eight attributes relating to efficacy, regimen, and side effects. Preference weights were estimated using hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression; relative attribute importance estimates were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, 207 patients were included (age ≥56 years, 65.7%; male, 54.1%). Patients chose adjuvant treatment 91.2% of the time vs no treatment. Prolonging overall survival from 25 to 78 months was most important, followed by reducing serious side effect risks. Increasing disease-free survival from 12 to 24 months was more important than decreasing risks of fatigue from 54% to 15% and nausea from 53% to 7%. Treatment with the shortest dosing regimen was more important for patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy; prolonging overall survival was more important than reducing the risk of a serious side effect in non-US patients; the opposite was found in the United States. CONCLUSION: Patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma who underwent radical resection preferred adjuvant treatment over no treatment regardless of side effects. Patients prioritized overall survival improvements followed by a reduced side effect profile.",1
Patient Perspectives on the Burden and Prevention of Diabetes-Related Foot Disease.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to understand patient perspectives about the impact and prevention of diabetes-related foot disease (DFD). METHODS: An online survey was distributed to patients with a history of DFD during 2020. The survey was designed alongside clinical specialists and DFD patients and utilized the health belief model. It asked about the impact of DFD on health, perceptions on preventive strategies, perceived need for additional support, and patient preferences for telehealth in DFD management. Quantitative data were summarized descriptively and compared between groups. Open-text responses were analyzed using conceptual content analysis. RESULTS: Of 80 participants with a history of DFD, foot ulcers were the complication most often experienced, with over two-thirds having been admitted to hospital for a DFD-related issue and over one-third having a DFD-related amputation. Participants had ranging perceptions on the effect of DFD on health, from minimal to crippling. Those with previous severe DFD complications leading to hospital admission found a lack of mobility and independence the consequences of most concern. Using offloading footwear was perceived as very important for preventing DFD complications, although the use of offloading footwear was low, with participants citing issues relating to cost, comfort, appearance, and access to footwear as barriers to better adherence. Perceptions on telehealth were mixed, with many participants not having access to or being comfortable with the use of digital technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DFD require additional supports for effective prevention, including offloading footwear.",0
Using decision support tools for treatment decision making about antidepressants in outpatient psychiatric consultations.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the use of decision support tools in decision making about antidepressants during conversations between patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and their psychiatrists. METHODS: Theme-oriented discourse analysis of two psychiatric consultation groups: control (n = 17) and intervention (n = 16). In the control group, only a doctor's conversation guide was used; in the intervention group, the conversation guide and a patient decision aid (PDA) were used. RESULTS: Psychiatrists mainly dominated conversations in both consultation groups. They were less likely to elicit patient treatment-related perspectives in the intervention group as they focused more on delivering the information than obtaining patient perspectives. However, using PDA in the intervention group slightly encouraged patients to participate in decisional talk. CONCLUSION: The decision support tools did promote SDM performance. Using the conversation guide in both consultation groups encouraged the elicitation of patient perspectives, which helped the psychiatrists in tailoring their recommendations of options based on patient preferences and concerns. Using the PDA in the intervention group created space for treatment discussion and fostered active collaboration in treatment decision making. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Our findings have implications for SDM communication skills training and critical reflection on SDM practice.",0
Factors Influencing Primary Care Practitioners' Cancer Screening Recommendations for Older Adults: a Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Primary care practitioners (PCPs) play a key role in cancer screening decisions for older adults (≥ 65 years), but recommendations vary by cancer type and jurisdiction. PURPOSE: To examine the factors influencing PCPs' recommendations for breast, cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer screening for older adults. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Pre-Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL, searched from 1 January 2000 to July 2021, and citation searching in July 2022. STUDY SELECTION: Assessed factors influencing PCPs' breast, prostate, colorectal, or cervical cancer screening decisions for older adults' (defined either as ≥ 65 years or < 10-year life expectancy). DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently conducted data extraction and quality appraisal. Decisions were crosschecked and discussed where necessary. DATA SYNTHESIS: From 1926 records, 30 studies met inclusion criteria. Twenty were quantitative, nine were qualitative, and one used a mixed method design. Twenty-nine were conducted in the USA, and one in the UK. Factors were synthesized into six categories: patient demographic characteristics, patient health characteristics, patient and clinician psycho-social factors, clinician characteristics, and health system factors. Patient preference was most reported as influential across both quantitative and qualitative studies. Age, health status, and life expectancy were also commonly influential, but PCPs held nuanced views about life expectancy. Weighing benefits/harms was also commonly reported with variation across cancer screening types. Other factors included patient screening history, clinician attitudes/personal experiences, patient/provider relationship, guidelines, reminders, and time. LIMITATIONS: We could not conduct a meta-analysis due to variability in study designs and measurement. The vast majority of included studies were conducted in the USA. CONCLUSIONS: Although PCPs play a role in individualizing cancer screening for older adults, multi-level interventions are needed to improve these decisions. Decision support should continue to be developed and implemented to support informed choice for older adults and assist PCPs to consistently provide evidence-based recommendations.

Patient motivators to use opioids for acute pain after emergency care.,"INTRODUCTION: Patients are stakeholders in their own pain management. Factors motivating individuals to seek or use opioids therapeutically for treatment of acute pain are not well characterized but could be targeted to reduce incident iatrogenic opioid use disorder (OUD). Emergency departments (EDs) commonly encounter patients in acute pain for whom decisions regarding opioid therapy are required. Decision-making is necessarily challenged in episodic, unscheduled care settings given time pressure, limited information, and lack of pre-existing patient provider relationship. Patients may decline to take prescribed opioids or conversely seek opioids from other providers or non-medical sources. METHODS: Using a framework analysis approach, we qualitatively analyzed transcripts from 29 patients after discharge from an ED visit for acute pain at a large, urban, academic hospital in the midwestern United States to describe motivating factors influencing patient decisions regarding opioid use for acute pain. A semi-structured interview guide framed participant discussion in either a focus group or interview transcribed and analyzed with conventional content analysis. RESULTS: Four major themes emerged from our analysis including a) pain management literacy, b) control preferences, c) risk tolerance, and d) cues to action. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest targets for future intervention development and a framework to guide the engagement of patients as stakeholders in their own acute pain management.",0
miRNAs as cornerstones in chronic lymphocytic leukemia pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance- An emphasis on the interaction of signaling pathways.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) accounts for the vast majority of cases of leukemia. Patients of advanced age are more likely to develop the condition, which has a highly varied clinical course. Consideration of illness features and preceding treatment sequence, as well as patient preferences and comorbidities, is necessary for selecting the appropriate treatment for the appropriate patient. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity to detect CLL early, monitor CLL patients, select the treatment responders, and reduce ineffective treatment, unwanted side effects, and unnecessary expenses. In both homeostasis and illness, microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) play a vital role as master regulators of gene expression and, by extension, protein expression. MiRNAs typically reduce the stability of mRNAs, including those encoding genes involved in tumorigenesis processes as cell cycle regulation, inflammation, stress response, angiogenesis, differentiation, apoptosis, and invasion. Due to their unique properties, miRNAs are rapidly being exploited as accurate biomarkers for illness detection, and medicines based on miRNA targets are finding widespread application in clinical practice. Accordingly, the current review serves as a quick primer on CLL and the biogenesis of miRNAs. In addition to providing a brief overview of the miRNAs whose function in the progression of CLL has been established by recent in vitro or in vivo research through articulating the influence of these miRNAs on a wide variety of cellular functions, including increased proliferative potential; support for angiogenesis; cell cycle aberration; evasion of apoptosis; promotion of metastasis; and reduced sensitivity to specific treatments.",0
Impact of patient choice and hospital competition on patient outcomes after rectal cancer surgery: A national population-based study.,"BACKGROUND: The objective of the current national cohort study was to analyze the correlation between choice and competition on outcomes after cancer surgery in rectal cancer. METHODS: The analysis included all men who underwent rectal cancer surgery in the English National Health Service between March 2015 and April 2019 (n = 13,996). Multilevel logistic regression was used to assess the effect of a rectal cancer surgery center being located in a competitive environment (based on the number of centers within a threshold distance) and being a successful competitor (based on the ability to attract patients from other hospitals) on eight patient-level outcomes: 30- and 90-day emergency readmissions, 30-day re-operation rates, 90-day postoperative mortality, length of stay >14 days, circumferential resection margin status, rates of primary procedure with a permanent stoma, and rates of persistent stoma 18 months after anterior resection. RESULTS: With adjustment for patient characteristics, patients who underwent surgery in centers located in a stronger competitive environment were less likely to have an abdominoperineal excision or a Hartman's procedure (odds ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.97, p = .04). Additionally, individuals who received treatment at hospitals that were successful competitors had a lower risk of a 90-day readmission following rectal cancer surgery (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.97, p = .03) and were less likely to have a persistent stoma at 18 months after anterior resection (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.93, p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals located in areas of high competition are associated with better patient outcomes and improved processes of care for rectal cancer surgery.",0
"Robotic repair of moderate-sized midline ventral hernias reduced complications, readmissions, and length of hospitalization compared to open techniques.","PURPOSE: To compare outcomes of robotic and open repair for uncomplicated, moderate-sized, midline ventral hernias. METHODS: From 2017 to 2021, patient characteristics and 30 day outcomes for all ventral hernias at our center were prospectively collected. We studied hernias potentially suitable for robotic repair: elective, midline, 3-10 cm rectus separation, no prior mesh, and no need for concomitant procedure. Robotic or open repair was performed by surgeon or patient preference. The primary outcome was any complication using Clavien-Dindo scoring. Secondary outcomes were operative time, length-of-stay, and readmissions. Regression identified predictors of complications. RESULTS: Of 648 hernias repaired, 70 robotic and 52 open repairs met inclusion criteria. The groups had similar patient demographics, co-morbidities, and hernia size, except that there were more immunosuppressed patients in the open group (11 versus 5 patients, p = 0.031). Complications occurred after 7 (13%) open repairs versus 2 (3%) robotic repairs, p = 0.036. Surgical site infection occurred after four open repairs but no robotic repair, p = 0.004. Length-of-stay averaged almost 3 days longer after open repair (4.3 ± 2.7 days versus 1.5 ± 1.4 days, p = 0.031). Readmission occurred after 6 (12%) oppen repairs but only 1 (1%) robotic repair. A long-term survey (61% response rate after mean follow-up of 2.8 years) showed that the HerQLes QOL score was better after robotic repair (46 ± 15 versus 40 ± 17,  = 0.049). In regression models, only open technique predicted complications. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic techniques were associated with fewer complications, shorter hospitalization, fewer infections, and fewer readmissions compared to open techniques. Open surgical technique was the only predictor of complications.",0
Patient and caregiver preferences for haemophilia treatments: A discrete-choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: An evolving haemophilia treatment landscape provides new possibilities for previously unattainable lifestyles. AIM: We sought to understand how people with haemophilia (PwH) and their caregivers value the potential benefits of novel prophylactic treatments. We conducted a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) to quantify preferences for features of haemophilia treatments among adults and caregivers of children with haemophilia. A best-worst scaling (BWS) exercise measured the perceived burden of treatment administration features. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was administered to male adults (≥18 years) and caregivers of male children (≤17 years) living with haemophilia in the United States. Respondents evaluated eight pairs of hypothetical haemophilia treatment profiles defined by six attributes in the DCE and 15 features in the BWS. RESULTS: In the DCE, both adults with haemophilia (n = 151) and caregivers (n = 151) prioritised avoiding the risk of developing inhibitor/ anti-drug antibodies and treatments that allowed for a more active life. They placed a lower priority on reducing the number of spontaneous bleeding episodes, route and frequency of administration, and avoiding the risk of hospitalisation due to adverse events. The BWS documented the burdensomeness of IV infusions and medications that require mixing and refrigeration. CONCLUSION: PwH and caregivers prefer treatments that enable a more active lifestyle with a lower risk of inhibitor development. Both groups valued the ability to lead an active life over reducing spontaneous bleeding, with caregivers placing the most weight on this attribute. As new treatments expand possibilities, healthcare professionals and PwH should continue to share decision-making, incorporating clinical judgment and individual preferences.",1
Effects of decision aids on breast reconstruction: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate the effects of decision aids for women facing breast reconstruction decision on decision conflict, decision regret, knowledge, satisfaction, anxiety and depression. BACKGROUND: Breast reconstruction decision is not good or bad and should be guided by clinical evidence and patient preferences. Decision aids can increase the patient's decision-making enthusiasm and ability, improve the quality of decision and promote shared decision-making between patients and medical staff. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Eight databases were conducted from the establishment of the database until October 2021. The PRISMA checklist was selected for analysis in this paper. The meta-analysis was conducted in Review Manager 5.3. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The result is decision conflict, decision regret, knowledge and other secondary outcomes. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were also conducted. RESULTS: A total of twelve randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed that decision aids could significantly reduce decision conflict and decision regret, improve knowledge, satisfaction and depression and had no influence on anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the systematic review and meta-analysis reviewed the positive effect of decision aids on the decision-making of women facing postmastectomy breast reconstruction. In the future, more well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm the effects of decision aids on the decision-making of breast reconstruction and nurses should be encouraged to take part in the development of decision aids in accordance with strict standards and apply them to breast cancer patients considering postmastectomy breast reconstruction. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Our study provides evidence for the effectiveness of decision aids on breast reconstruction and points to the important role of healthcare providers in the use of decision aids and in facilitating shared decision-making.",0
Long-Term Outcome of Intact Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm After Endovascular or Open Repair.,"OBJECTIVE: Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) has been established as a standard treatment option for intact abdominal aortic aneurysm (iAAA) and gained importance due to a lower perioperative mortality than open repair (OAR). However, whether this survival advantage can be maintained or if OAR is beneficial in terms of long-term complications and reinterventions remains questionable. DESIGN: In this retrospective cohort study data from patients undergoing elective EVAR or OAR for iAAAs in the years 2010-2016 was analyzed. The patients were followed through 2018. METHODS: In the propensity score matched cohorts the perioperative and long-term outcomes of the patients were assessed. We identified 20 683 patients undergoing elective iAAA repair (76.4% EVAR). The propensity matched cohorts included 4886 pairs of patients. RESULTS: The perioperative mortality was 1.9% for EVAR and 5.9% for OAR (P = <.001). The perioperative mortality was mainly influenced by patients age (Odds-Ratio (OR):1.073, confidence interval (CI):1.058-1.088, P ≤ .001) and OAR (OR:3.242, CI:2.552-4.119, P ≤ .001). The early survival benefit after endovascular repair persisted for approximately 3 years (estimated survival EVAR 82.3%, OAR 80.9%, P = .021). After that time the estimated survival curves were similar. After 9 years the estimated survival was 51.2% after EVAR as compared to 52.8% after OAR (P = .102). The operation method didn't influence long-term survival significantly (Hazard-Ratio (HR): 1.046, CI: .975-1.122, P = .211). The vascular reintervention rate was 17.4% in the EVAR cohort and 7.1% in the OAR cohort (P ≤ .001). CONCLUSION: EVAR has a significantly lower perioperative mortality than OAR, a survival benefit that lasts up to 3 years after intervention. Thereafter, no significant difference in survival was observed between EVAR and OAR. The decision between EVAR or OAR may depend on patient preference, surgeons' experience, and the institutions' ability to handle complications.",0
US Residents' Preferences for Sharing of Electronic Health Record and Genetic Information: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim to this study was to assess preferences for sharing of electronic health record (EHR) and genetic information separately and to examine whether there are different preferences for sharing these 2 types of information. METHODS: Using a population-based, nationally representative survey of the United States, we conducted a discrete choice experiment in which half of the subjects (N = 790) responded to questions about sharing of genetic information and the other half (N = 751) to questions about sharing of EHR information. Conditional logistic regression models assessed relative preferences across attribute levels of where patients learn about health information sharing, whether shared data are deidentified, whether data are commercialized, how long biospecimens are kept, and what the purpose of sharing the information is. RESULTS: Individuals had strong preferences to share deidentified (vs identified) data (odds ratio [OR] 3.26, 95% confidence interval 2.68-3.96) and to be able to opt out of sharing information with commercial companies (OR 4.26, 95% confidence interval 3.42-5.30). There were no significant differences regarding how long biospecimens are kept or why the data are being shared. Individuals had a stronger preference for opting out of sharing genetic (OR 4.26) versus EHR information (OR 2.64) (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Hospital systems and regulatory bodies should consider patient preferences for sharing of personal medical records or genetic information. For both genetic and EHR information, patients strongly prefer their data to be deidentified and to have the choice to opt out of sharing information with commercial companies.",1
Fix or Replace? Patient Preferences for the Treatment of Geriatric Lower Extremity Fractures: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: When considering treatment options for geriatric patients with lower extremity fractures, little is known about which outcomes are prioritized by patients. This study aimed to determine the patient preferences for outcomes after a geriatric lower extremity fracture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We administered a discrete choice experiment survey to 150 patients who were at least 60 years of age and treated for a lower extremity fracture at a Level I trauma center. The discrete choice experiment presented study participants with 8 sets of hypothetical outcome comparisons, including joint preservation (yes or no), risk of reoperation at 6 months and 24 months, postoperative weightbearing status, disposition, and function as measured by return to baseline walking distance. We estimated the relative importance of these potential outcomes using multinomial logit modeling. RESULTS: The strongest patient preference was for maintained function after treatment (59%, P < .001), followed by reoperation within 6 months (12%, P < .001). Although patients generally favored joint preservation, patients were willing to change their preference in favor of joint replacement if it increased function (walking distance) by 13% (SE, 66%). Reducing the short-term reoperation risk (12%, P < .001) was more important to patients than reducing long-term reoperation risk (4%, P = .33). Disposition and weightbearing status were lesser priorities to patients (9%, P < .001 and 7%, P < .001, respectively). DISCUSSION: After a lower extremity fracture, geriatric patients prioritized maintained walking function. Avoiding short-term reoperation was more important than avoiding long-term reoperation. Joint preservation through fracture fixation was the preferred treatment of geriatric patients unless arthroplasty or arthrodesis provides a meaningful functional benefit. Hospital disposition and postoperative weightbearing status were less important to patients than the other included outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric patients strongly prioritize function over other outcomes after a lower extremity fracture.",1
Lessons Learned from Telemonitoring in an Outpatient Bariatric Surgery Pathway-Secondary Outcomes of a Patient Preference Clinical Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Remote monitoring is increasingly used to support postoperative care. This study aimed to describe the lessons learned from the use of telemonitoring in an outpatient bariatric surgery pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were assigned based on their preference to an intervention cohort of same-day discharge after bariatric surgery. In total, 102 patients were monitored continuously for 7 days using a wearable monitoring device with a Continuous and Remote Early Warning Score-based notification protocol (CREWS). Outcome measures included missing data, course of postoperative heart and respiration rate, false positive notification and specificity analysis, and vital sign assessment during teleconsultation. RESULTS: In 14.7% of the patients, data for heart rate was missing for > 8 h. A day-night-rhythm of heart rate and respiration rate reappeared on average on postoperative day 2 with heart rate amplitude increasing after day 3. CREWS notification had a specificity of 98%. Of the 17 notifications, 70% was false positive. Half of them occurred between day 4 and 7 and were accompanied with surrounding reassuring values. Comparable postoperative complaints were encountered between patients with normal and deviated data. CONCLUSION: Telemonitoring after outpatient bariatric surgery is feasible. It supports clinical decisions, however does not replace nurse or physician care. Although infrequent, the false notification rate was high. We suggested additional contact may not be necessary when notifications occur after restoration of circadian rhythm or when surrounding reassuring vital signs are present. CREWS supports ruling out serious complications, what may reduce in-hospital re-evaluations. Following these lessons learned, increased patients' comfort and decreased clinical workload could be expected. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifier: NCT04754893.",0
"Cardio4Health Study, a Cardiac Telerehabilitation Pilot Program Aimed at Patients After an Ischemic Event: Cross-sectional Study.","BACKGROUND: Center-based cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRPs) reduce morbidity and mortality after an ischemic cardiac event; however, they are widely underused. Home-based CRP has emerged as an alternative to improve patient adherence; however, its safety and efficacy remain unclear, especially for older patients and female patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a holistic home-based CRP for patients with ischemic heart disease and evaluate its safety and impact on functional capacity, adherence to a healthy lifestyle, and quality of life. METHODS: The 8-week home-based CRP included patients of both sexes, with no age limit, who had overcome an acute myocardial infarction in the previous 3 months, had a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≥40%, and had access to a tablet or mobile device. The CRP was developed using a dedicated platform designed explicitly for this purpose and included 3 weekly exercise sessions combining tailored aerobic and strength training and 2 weekly educational session focused on lifestyle habits, therapeutic adherence, and patient empowerment. RESULTS: We initially included 62 patients, of whom 1 was excluded for presenting with ventricular arrhythmias during the initial stress test, 5 were excluded because of incompatibility, and 6 dropped out because of a technological barrier. Ultimately, 50 patients completed the program: 85% (42/50) were male, with a mean age of 58.9 (SD 10.3) years, a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 52.1% (SD 6.72%), and 25 (50%) New York Heart Association functional class I and 25 (50%) New York Heart Association II-III. The CRP significantly improved functional capacity (+1.6 metabolic equivalent tasks), muscle strength (arm curl test +15.5% and sit-to-stand test +19.7%), weekly training volume (+803 metabolic equivalent tasks), adherence to the Mediterranean diet, emotional state (anxiety), and quality of life. No major complications occurred, and adherence was excellent (>80%) in both the exercise and educational sessions. In the subgroup analysis, CRP showed equivalent beneficial effects irrespective of sex and age. In addition, patient preferences for CRP approaches were equally distributed, with one-third (14/50, 29%) of the patients preferring a face-to-face CRP, one-third (17/50, 34%) preferring a telematic CRP, and one-third (18/50, 37%) preferring a hybrid approach. Regarding CRP duration, 63% (31/50) of the patients considered it adequate, whereas the remaining 37% (19/50) preferred a longer program. CONCLUSIONS: A holistic telematic CRP dedicated to patients after an ischemic cardiac event, irrespective of sex and age, is safe and, in our population, has achieved positive results in improving maximal aerobic capacity, weekly training volume, muscle strength, quality of life, compliance with diet, and anxiety symptoms. The preference for a center- or home-based CRP approach is diverse among the study population, emphasizing the need for a tailored CRP to improve adherence and completion rates.",0
Improving Hands-Free Speech Rehabilitation in Laryngectomized Patients with a Moldable Adhesive.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the product performance of a new moldable peristomal adhesive with corresponding heating pad designed to facilitate and improve automatic speaking valve (ASV) fixation for hands-free speech in laryngectomized patients. METHODS: Twenty laryngectomized patients, all regular adhesive users with prior ASV experience, were included. Study-specific questionnaires were used for data collection at baseline and after two weeks of moldable adhesive use. The primary outcome parameters were adhesive lifetime during hands-free speech, use and duration of hands-free speech, and patient preference. Additional outcome parameters were satisfaction, comfort, fit, and usability. RESULTS: The moldable adhesive enabled ASV fixation adequate for hands-free speech in the majority of participants. Overall, the moldable adhesive significantly increased adhesive lifetime and duration of hands-free speech compared to participants' baseline adhesives (p < 0.05), regardless of stoma depth, skin irritation, or regular use of hands-free speech at baseline. The participants who preferred the moldable adhesive (55% of participants) experienced a significant increase in the adhesive lifetime (median of 24 h, range 8-144 h) and improved comfort, fit, and ease of speech. CONCLUSION: The moldable adhesive's lifetime and functional aspects, including the ease of use and custom fit, are encouraging outcomes and enable more laryngectomized patients to use hands-free speech more regularly.

Barriers to Optimal Clinician Guideline Adherence in the Management of Markedly Elevated Blood Pressure: A Qualitative Content Analysis of Electronic Health Records.,"IMPORTANCE: Hypertension poses a significant public health challenge. Despite clinical practice guidelines for hypertension management, clinician adherence to these guidelines remains suboptimal. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a taxonomy of suboptimal adherence scenarios for severe hypertension and identify barriers to guideline adherence. DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative content analysis using electronic health records (EHRs) of Yale New Haven Health System who had at least two consecutive visits between January 1, 2013, and October 31, 2018. SETTING: This was a thematic analysis of EHR data to generate a real-world taxonomy of scenarios of suboptimal clinician guideline adherence in the management of severe hypertension. PARTICIPANTS: We identified patients with markedly elevated blood pressure ([BP]; defined as at least 2 consecutive readings of BP ≥160/100 mmHg) and no prescription for antihypertensive medication within a 90-day of the 2(nd) BP elevation (n=4,828). We randomly selected 100 records from the group of all eligible patients for qualitative analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The scenarios and influencing factors contributing to clinician non-adherence to the guidelines for hypertension management. RESULTS: Thematic saturation was reached after analyzing 100 patient records. Three content domains emerged: clinician-related scenarios (neglect and diffusion of responsibility), patient-related scenarios (patient non-adherence and patient preference), and clinical complexity-related scenarios (diagnostic uncertainty, maintenance of current intervention and competing medical priorities). Through a metareview of literature, we identified several plausible influencing factors, including a lack of protocols and processes that clearly define the roles within the institution to implement guidelines, infrastructure limitations, and clinicians' lack of autonomy and authority, excessive workload, time constraints, clinician belief that intervention was not part of their role, or perception that guidelines restrict clinical judgment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study illuminates reasons for suboptimal adherence to guidelines for managing markedly elevated BP. The taxonomy of suboptimal adherence scenarios, derived from real-world EHR data, is pragmatic and provides a basis for developing targeted interventions to improve clinician guideline adherence and patient outcomes.",0
Multidisciplinary Guidelines for the Rational Use of Topical Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs for Musculoskeletal Pain (2022).,"(1) Background: Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the primary drugs for treating musculoskeletal pain. However, there are currently no evidence-based recommendations about drug selection, drug administration, drug interactions, and use in special populations or other pharmacology-related content of such medications. To this end, the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association Hospital Pharmacy Professional Committee developed multidisciplinary guidelines on using topical NSAIDs to treat musculoskeletal pain. (2) Methods: The guidelines development process followed the World Health Organization guideline development handbook, the GRADE methodology, and the statement of Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare. The guideline panel used the Delphi method to identify six clinical questions to be addressed in the guidelines. An independent systematic review team conducted a systematic search and integration of evidence. (3) Results: Based on the balance between the benefits and harms of an intervention, the quality of the evidence, patient preferences and values, and resource utilization, the guideline panel developed 11 recommendations and nine expert consensuses on using topical NSAIDs to treat acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain. (4) Conclusions: Based on the effectiveness and overall safety of topical NSAIDs, we recommend patients with musculoskeletal pain use topical NSAIDs and suggest high-risk patients use topical NSAIDs, such as those with other diseases or receiving other concurrent treatments. The evidenced-based guidelines on topical NSAIDs for musculoskeletal pain incorporated a pharmacist perspective. The guidelines have the potential to facilitate the rational use of topical NSAIDs. The guideline panel will monitor the relevant evidence and update the recommendations accordingly.",0
Patients' choice preferences for specialist outpatient online consultations: A discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Internet hospitals are multiplying with solid support from the Chinese government. In internet hospitals, specialist outpatient online consultations (SOOC) are the primary services. However, the acceptance and utilization rates of this service are still low. Thus, the study of patients' choice preferences for SOOC is needed. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the choice preference of patients' SOOC via a discrete choice experiment, understand the influence of each factor and promote the development of internet hospitals. METHODS: Via a discrete selection experiment, a total of 162 patients from two general hospitals and three specialized hospitals in Beijing were selected for the questionnaire survey. The choice preferences were analyzed by conditional logit regression. RESULTS: From high to low, patients' willingness to pay (WTP) for the attributes of SOOC is as follows: doctors' recommendation rate (β (highly recommend) = 0.999), the convenience of applying SOOC services (β (Convenient) = 0.760), the increasing ratio of medical insurance payment for online services compared to offline (β (Increase by 10%) = 0.545), and the disease's severity (β (severe) = -3.024). The results of the subgroup analysis showed differences in patient choice preference by age, whether the patients had chronic diseases, income, and medical insurance types. CONCLUSION: Both price and nonprice attributes influence the choice preference of SOOC for patients. Among them, patients are more inclined to choose SOOC when doctors highly recommend it, when it is convenient to apply, when medical insurance increases by 10%, and when disease severity is mild. The current findings show the government and medical institutions formulate auxiliary policies and welfare strategies by clarifying core attributes and adjusting the levels of different attributes to improve patients' acceptance of SOOC. The utility of SOOC and the further development of internet hospitals are radically promoted.",1
Method for Calculating the Simultaneous Maximum Acceptable Risk Threshold (SMART) from Discrete-Choice Experiment Benefit-Risk Studies.,"BACKGROUND: Medical decisions require weighing expected benefits of treatment against multiple adverse outcomes under uncertainty (i.e., risks) that must be accepted as a bundle. However, conventional maximum acceptable risk (MAR) estimates derived from discrete-choice experiment benefit-risk studies evaluate the acceptance of individual risks, assuming other risks are fixed, potentially leading decision makers to misinterpret levels of risk acceptance. DESIGN: Using simulations and a published discrete-choice experiment, we demonstrate a method for identifying multidimensional risk-tolerance measures given a treatment level of benefit. RESULTS: Simultaneous Maximum Acceptable Risk Thresholds (SMART) represents combinations of risks that would be jointly accepted in exchange for specific treatment benefits. The framework shows how the expectation of utility associated with treatments that involve multiple risks are related even when preferences for potential adverse events are independent. We find that the form of the marginal effects of adverse-event probabilities on the expected utility of treatment determines the magnitude of differences between SMART and conventional single-outcome MAR estimates. LIMITATIONS: Preferences for potential adverse events not considered in a study or preferences for adverse-event attributes held constant in risk-tolerance calculations may affect estimated risk tolerance. Further research is needed to understand the right balance between realistically reflecting clinical treatments with many potential adverse events and the cognitive burden of evaluating risk-risk tradeoffs in research and in practice. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: SMART analysis should be considered in preference studies evaluating the joint acceptance of multiple potential adverse events. HIGHLIGHTS: Conventional approaches to calculate maximum-acceptable risk (MAR) using discrete-choice experiment data account for 1 adverse-event risk at a time, requiring that decision makers infer the acceptability of treatments when patients are exposed to multiple risks simultaneously.The Simultaneous Maximum Acceptable Risk Threshold (SMART) maps combinations of adverse-event risks that would be jointly acceptable given a specific treatment benefit and provides a transparent and precise portrayal of acceptance of multiple risks.Risk levels that would be accepted using individual MAR estimates might not be acceptable when simultaneous risks are considered, especially when marginal expected disutility of risk is decreasing nonlinearly with risk probabilities.Preference researchers should calculate SMARTs in any discrete-choice study in which 2 or more adverse-event risks are presented, particularly if risk preferences are nonlinear.",1
Patient and clinician perspectives of information needs concerning oral epithelial dysplasia.,"OBJECTIVES: Individuals diagnosed with a chronic oral disease that increase the risk of mouth cancer, such as oral epithelial dysplasia (OED), require appropriate knowledge to make informed decisions. The present study aimed to assess whether patient information needs of a group of patients concerning dysplasia were met and to what degree clinicians agree with patients on 'important' topics. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This represented secondary analyses of a cross-sectional study to assess the information needs of 86 patients diagnosed with dysplasia compared with those of 77 clinicians using the validated OED Information Needs Questionnaire. Descriptive, concordance and regression analyses were performed for the collected data. RESULTS: The mean and median total scores for all items in the amount of information received subscale were 2.33 and 2.44, indicating overall unmet needs concerning dysplasia. Clinicians were generally able to predict topics of greatest importance to patients, although their scores were mainly lower than those of patients (k = 0.06). There was a higher agreement between patients (k = 0.25) than clinicians (k = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Clinicians are encouraged to assess a patient's information needs to ensure tailored and patient-centred communication concerning OED during all clinical consultations.",0
"Treatment preferences of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France, and Spain: results from a discrete choice experiment.","INTRODUCTION: Newer treatment options for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) with efficacy and safety profiles that differ from traditional therapies have facilitated personalized management strategies to optimize patient outcomes. In the context of such personalized management, understanding how treatment characteristics influence patients' preferences is essential. This study assessed patients' preferences for RRMM treatment attributes and determined trade-offs between potential benefits, administration procedures, and adverse effects. METHODS: Patients' preferences were evaluated using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Patients with RRMM who reported failing two lines of anti-myeloma treatment (immunomodulatory agent and a proteasome inhibitor [PI]) or ≥ 3 lines (including ≥1 PI, immunomodulatory agent, or anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody), were recruited across the US, UK, Italy, Germany, France, and Spain. DCE attributes and levels were identified using a targeted literature review, a review of clinical data for relevant RRMM treatments, qualitative patient interviews, and input from clinical and myeloma patient experts. The DCE was administered within an online survey from February-June 2022. Preference data were analyzed using an error-component logit model and willingness to make trade-offs for potential benefits, and relative attribute importance scores were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, 296 patients from the US (n = 100), UK (n = 49), Italy (n = 45), Germany (n = 43), France (n = 39), and Spain (n = 20) participated in the DCE. Mean (standard deviation) age was 63.8 (8.0) years, 84% had a caregiver, and patients had a median of 3 (range: 2-8) prior lines of therapy. Efficacy attributes most influenced patients' preferences, with increasing overall response rate (25-85%) and overall survival (6 months to 2 years) contributing to ~50% of treatment decision-making. Administration procedures were also considered important to patients. Avoiding individual side effects was considered relatively less important, with patients willing to tolerate increases in side effects for gains in efficacy. Patient characteristics such as rate of disease progression, sociodemographics, or clinical characteristics also influenced treatment preferences. CONCLUSION: Patients with RRMM were willing to tolerate increased risk of side effects for higher efficacy. Preferences and risk tolerance varied between patients, with preference patterns differing by certain patient characteristics. This highlights the importance of shared decision-making for optimal treatment selection and patient outcomes.",1

Eliciting preferences for cancer screening tests: Comparison of a discrete choice experiment and the threshold technique.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare results of three preference elicitation methods for a cancer screening test. METHODS: Participants (undergraduate students) completed a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and a threshold technique (TT) task. Accuracy (false positives, false negatives), benefits (lives saved), and cost for a cancer screening test were used as attributes in the DCE and branching logic for the TT. Participants were also asked a direct elicitation question regarding a hypothetical screening test for breast (women) or prostate (men) cancer without mortality benefit. Correlations assessed the relationship between DCE and TT thresholds. Thresholds were standardized and ranked for both methods to compare. A logistic regression used the thresholds to predict results of the direct elicitation. RESULTS: DCE and TT estimates were not meaningfully correlated (max ρ = 0.17). Participant rankings of attributes matched only 20% of the time (58/292). Neither method predicted preference for being screened (ps > 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: The DCE and TT yielded different preference estimates (and rank orderings) for the same participant. Neither method predicted patients' desires for a screening test. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians, patients, policy makers, and researchers should be aware that patient preference results may be sensitive to the method of eliciting preferences.",1
Primary health care during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative exploration of the challenges and changes in practice experienced by GPs and GP trainees.,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly changed general practice in the UK. Research is required to understand how General Practitioners (GPs) and GP trainees adjusted to these changes, so that beneficial changes might be sustained, and Primary Health Care (PHC) can be prepared for future challenges. This study explored the experiences and perspectives of GP and GP trainees during the pandemic. METHODS: Remote, semi-structured interviews (n = 21) were conducted with GPs (n = 11) and GP trainees (n = 10), recruited from across the UK using convenience and purposive sampling. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interview data were analysed with an inductive thematic approach. RESULTS: Five overarching themes were identified: (1) 'Thrown in at the deep end'; (2) Telemedicine: 'it needs to be a happy balance'; (3) Delayed referrals and 'holding' patients; (4) The Covid Cohort-training in Covid; (5) Suggestions and lessons for the future of general practice'. GPs reported a turbulent and uncertain time of major changes to PHC. They described the benefits of technology in general medicine, particularly telemedicine, when used in a balanced manner, highlighting the need for accompanying teaching and guidelines, and the importance of patient preferences. Key tools to help GPs manage patients with delayed referrals to Secondary Care were also identified. CONCLUSION: Several key changes to general practice occurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including a rapid uptake of telemedicine. The pandemic exposed the strengths and limitations of normal general practice and highlighted the importance of workplace camaraderie. These findings contribute to the evidence base used to adapt PHC infrastructures as we emerge from the pandemic.",0
Perceptions and drivers of healthcare provider and drug dispenser practices for the treatment of malaria in pregnancy in the context of multiple first-line therapies in western Kenya: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Emergence of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemether-lumefantrine in Africa prompted the pilot introduction of multiple first-line therapies (MFT) against malaria in Kenya, potentially exposing women-of-childbearing-age (WOCBAs) to anti-malarials with unknown safety profiles in the first trimester. This qualitative study explored knowledge and perceptions among healthcare providers providing malaria treatment to WOCBAs and pregnant women. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with purposively selected public and private health facility (HF) and drug outlet (DO) providers within and outside the pilot-MFT area. County health managers were interviewed about their knowledge of the national treatment guidelines. Transcripts were coded by content analysis using the World Health Organization health system building blocks (leadership/governance, financing, health workforce, health information systems, access to medicines, and service delivery). RESULTS: Thirty providers (HF:21, DO:9) and three health managers were interviewed. Eighteen providers were from HFs in the pilot-MFT area; the remaining three and all nine DOs were outside the pilot-MFT area. The analysis revealed that providers had not been trained in malaria case management in the previous twelve months. DO providers were unfamiliar with national treatment guidelines in pregnancy and reported having no pregnancy tests. Health managers were unable to supervise DOs due to resource limitations. Providers from HFs and DOs noted poor sensitivity of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and hesitancy among patients who associated malaria-RDTs with HIV testing. Almost all providers reported anti-malarial stock-outs, with quinine most affected. Patient preference was a major factor in prescribing anti-malarials. Providers in HFs and DOs reported preferentially using artemether-lumefantrine in the first trimester due to the side effects and unavailability of quinine. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of malaria case management in drug outlets and health facilities remains poor. Improved regulation of DO providers is warranted. Optimizing treatment of malaria in pregnancy requires training, availability of malaria commodities, and pregnancy tests.",0
Advances in Human-Centered Care to Address Contemporary Unmet Needs in Chronic Dialysis.,"Advances in the treatment of kidney failure with chronic dialysis have stagnated over the past three decades, with over 50% of patients still managed by conventional in-hospital haemodialysis. In parallel, the demands of chronic dialysis medical care have changed and evolved due to a growing population that has higher frailty and multimorbidity. Thus, the gap between the needs of kidney failure patients and the healthcare capability to provide effective overall management has widened. To address this problem, healthcare policy has increasingly aligned towards a human-centred approach. The paradigm shift of human-centred approach places patients at the forefront of decision-making processes, ensuring that specific needs are understood and prioritised. Integration of human-centred approaches with patient care has been shown to improve satisfaction and quality of life. The aim of this narrative is to evaluate the current clinical challenges for managing kidney failure for dialysis providers; summarise current experiences and unmet needs of chronic dialysis patients; and finally emphasise how human-centred care has advanced chronic dialysis care. Specific incremental advances include implementation of renal supportive care; home-assisted dialysis; hybrid dialysis; refinements to dialysis methods; whereas emerging advances include portable and wearable dialysis devices and the potential for the integration of artificial intelligence in clinical practice.",0

The Relative Importance of Factors That Applicants Weigh When Ranking Adult Reconstruction Fellowships as Well as Their Perspectives on Robotic-Assisted Arthroplasty.,"BACKGROUND: Orthopedic Surgery Fellowship programs offer highly specialized training that varies based on the training environment and surgical experience. Additionally, for Adult Reconstruction programs, robotic-assisted surgery exposure has been a widely discussed topic. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative value of various factors to Adult Hip and Knee Fellowship applicants, and their perceptions of robotic-assisted arthroplasty. METHODS: We surveyed 780 applicants who applied to our fellowship to matriculate in 2020 to 2024. We received 158 responses (20.3% response rate). We assessed factors concerning people and perceptions, logistics, salary and benefits, program reputation and curriculum, and surgical experience. Additionally, we surveyed fellows' attitudes toward using robotic surgery and its impact on patient outcomes. RESULTS: The highest-rated factors were Level of Hands-On Operative Experience (4.83), Revision Hip Volume (4.72), Revision Knee Volume (4.71), Multiple Surgical Exposures to the Hip (4.59), and Clinical Case Variety (4.59). Respondents who were postfellowship matriculation placed significantly more value on Exposure to Multiple Attendings with Surgical Diversity (P = .01), and Anterior Hip Volume (P = .04), and less value on Geographic Location (P = .04) and Patient-Specific Instrumentation (P = .02) than prematriculates. Overall, 65% of applicants plan to or currently use robotics, 7.6% do not, and 27.2% said ""Maybe"". Those who plan to or currently use robotics most cited procedure fidelity, patient-preference, and marketability as reasons to use robotics. CONCLUSIONS: Hands-on surgical experience and revision volume were the most important factors for fellowship applicants. Applicants placed lower importance on robotics exposure and their perspectives on robotics in their future practice were highly variable. Our results will inform fellowship programs and future applicants what previous applicants have valued in their training to help guide fellowship program structure, resource management, as well as recruitment.",0
Real-World Experience of People with Hemophilia A Receiving Turoctocog Alfa Pegol (N8-GP): Results from a Patient Experience Survey.,"PURPOSE: Turoctocog alfa pegol (N8-GP) is an extended half-life recombinant factor VIII molecule used for the treatment of hemophilia A (HA). The purpose of this study was to investigate real-world experiences of patients with HA treated with N8-GP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 25-minute online survey was completed by adults (≥18 years) and caregivers of adolescents (12-16 years) with HA receiving N8-GP across six countries (Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, UK and US). Patients were recruited using a multichannel approach through recruitment panels, referrals from healthcare professionals and patient associations. The survey comprised a questionnaire with metrics including satisfaction and preferences for N8-GP, quality of life (QoL) and long-term impact. RESULTS: A total of 62 participants (98% male [n=61], mean age 29 years) comprising 46 patients and 16 caregivers completed the survey. Patients (60% non-severe [n=37] and 40% severe [25]) were on N8-GP for a mean period of 1.4 years. Patients expressed satisfaction (95% vs 42%, p<0.001) and preference (91% vs 9%, p<0.001) for N8-GP vs their previous treatments. Most patients with severe HA (87%, p=0.038) and patients on prophylaxis (84%, p<0.001) stated lower frequency of injections as their main reason for satisfaction, while improved QoL drove satisfaction for non-severe patients (81%, p=0.053). Overall, patients perceived that QoL score improved (74.8 vs 65.9, p=0.01) with N8-GP treatment compared with previous treatments. Flexibility to store at room temperature was one of the key convenience factors driving satisfaction. Patients believed that N8-GP can offer a long-term impact in areas such as ability to perform day-to-day activities (68%), independence to live like a person without hemophilia (63%), ability to travel (60%) with a feeling of optimism and hopefulness (82%). CONCLUSION: Lower frequency of injections, storage flexibility and improved QoL drove satisfaction and preference for N8-GP over previous treatments among patients with HA.",0
Considering patient perspectives in economic evaluations of health interventions.,"Current guidelines for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of health interventions commonly recommend the use of a payer and/or a societal perspective. This raises the concern that the resulting reimbursement decision may overlook the full spectrum of impacts and equity considerations. In this paper, we argue that a potential solution is to supplement a societal- or payer-perspective economic evaluation with an additional evaluation accounting for exclusively the patient perspective. We present five categories of health interventions for which a patient-perspective analysis may be informative including those (1) that cross the definitional boundary between drugs and non-drug technologies; (2) affect patient adherence to protocol; (3) represent revolutionary treatments for genetic disorders; (4) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio involving slightly less effective, but substantially less costly, than the current standard; and (5) have been previously approved for funding but now being targeted for potential delisting or disinvestment. Real-world examples are discussed in detail. Lived experience individuals were invited to provide vignettes. Discussions are provided regarding how to incorporate patient inputs to improve patient-centered decision-making.",0

Cancer patients' expectations of advance care planning: A typological content analysis of qualitative interviews.,"BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) can help to elicit cancer patients' preferences in a discussion process to promote person-centred medical decision-making. Expectations are known to be highly relevant determinants of decisional processes. So far, however, little is known about cancer patients' expectations of ACP that lead to acceptance or refusal of the programme. The presented study, therefore, aims to explore cancer patients' expectations of ACP. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposeful sample of 27 cancer patients consenting to or refusing a newly implemented ACP programme in a German university hospital. Data were analysed using typological content analysis. RESULTS: We identified five different expectation clusters in relation to ACP. Consenting participants held expectations about the impact of ACP that were either 'ego-centred' or 'family-centred'. Refusers had expectations based on ignorance and misinformation, or-if they had already completed an advance directive-expectations to avoid unpleasant redundancy, perceiving no additional benefit but a burden from ACP. Finally, refusers in particular expressed expectations of delegated responsibility at the end of life, including anticipation of proxy decision-making. CONCLUSION: Our study results suggest that expectation-modifying measures could be taken to positively influence cancer patients' expectations and thus the acceptance of ACP. In this respect, reducing ignorance and misguided expectations plays a decisive role. Especially in family constellations with expected delegation of responsibility and dependence at the end of life, it might be important to promote ACP as a family-intervention to improve family outcomes.",0
Fast-Track Pathway: An Effective Way to Boost Diabetic Foot Care.,"Diabetes is a chronic disease that challenges global health issues in many aspects. Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is one of the most common causes of reduced quality of life and increased hospitalization, amputation, treatment costs, and mortality in patients. Improper patients' knowledge, unsatisfactory education and training of healthcare workers, and limited facilities are the major cause of delayed referral and downscale management in DFUs. The diabetic foot clinical pathway is pivotal in providing best practices based on the latest standards and patient preferences. In the diabetic foot clinical pathway provided by the Iran Ministry of Health, the common concepts and grading systems are well defined for diabetic foot specialists so that patients can be diagnosed correctly and referred properly. Based on clinical examination guidelines, patients with diabetes are classified into low-risk, moderate-risk, high-risk, and active diabetic foot ulcer groups. One of this Pathway's main objectives is to prevent the patient from getting the first ulcer, prevent frequent recurrence ulcers, and most importantly, prevent minor and major amputation.",0
"Getting to know our patients and what matters: exploring the elicitation of patient values, preferences, and circumstances in neurological rehabilitation.","PURPOSE: Patient values, preferences, and circumstances are critical to decision-making in both patient-centred and evidence-based practice models of healthcare. Despite the established importance of integrating these patient attributes, the ways they are elicited in rehabilitation remain unclear. This study aimed to explore how health professionals elicit and share patients' 'values', 'preferences', and 'circumstances', and what they understand by the terms. METHODS: This exploratory qualitative descriptive study used interviews with 13 clinicians from interprofessional teams in inpatient neurological rehabilitation. Data were analysed using a general inductive approach. RESULTS: Participants understood 'values' to mean what is important and meaningful; 'preferences' as likes/dislikes and choices; and 'circumstances' as the social, physical, and environmental context surrounding the person. Formal and informal strategies were used to gather information directly from patients or indirectly from other sources. The processes of eliciting and communicating this information were influenced by relationships and relied on contributions from many people. Elicitation involved a flexible approach tailored to the individual and considering each unique context. CONCLUSION: The strategies used and the approach used to implement these strategies were both essential to eliciting patient values, preferences, and circumstances in neurological rehabilitation. These findings offer insights into the practices of interprofessional rehabilitation clinicians. Implications for rehabilitationEliciting patient values, preferences, and circumstances involves a combination of strategies and approaches that are applied gradually throughout the continuum of rehabilitation.These processes are flexible, and strategies should be tailored to individual patients/families and phases of rehabilitation.Clinicians should be attentive to informal opportunities to gather valuable information throughout rehabilitation.Establishing positive relationships and using effective communication is foundational to these processes.",0
Preference of young adults for COVID-19 vaccination in the United Kingdom: a discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine preferences for COVID-19 vaccinations in the young adult population in the United Kingdom (UK). METHOD: A discrete choice experiment survey was conducted in UK young adults. Participants were asked to choose between two hypothetical vaccines the one they preferred the most. Vaccines were defined by five attributes (effectiveness, risk of side effects, duration of protection, number of doses, confidence in available evidence), identified following a systematic literature review and qualitative interviews with 13 young adults. A random parameters logit model, a latent class model, and subgroup analyses were used to identify preferences. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-nine respondents were included (70% women, mean age 23 years). All five attributes significantly influenced respondents' vaccination decisions. Respondents valued higher effectiveness, lower risk of side effects, longer protection duration, and a smaller number of doses. Based on the range of levels of each attribute, vaccine effectiveness was the most important attribute (relative importance 34%), followed by risk of side effects (32%), and duration of vaccine protection (22%). CONCLUSIONS: The five investigated vaccine attributes appear to play an important role in young adults' decision-making process. Results of this study may help health authorities designing appropriate strategies in future vaccines campaigns in the younger UK population.",1
Seizure Medications.,"The mainstay treatment strategy for seizures is medication management. However, much like the prescription of any other pharmaceutical agent, a clinician must balance efficacy with adverse events, and provide consideration for cost, drug interactions, patient preference, and availability. This activity outlines the indications, mechanisms of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of various seizure medications, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating indicated disorders as part of the interprofessional team with seizure medications, with a basis on the current knowledge for optimal utilization.",0
Acne characteristics in Latin American patients and the potential role of trifarotene.,"BACKGROUND: Individualization of treatment based on acne type and severity, location, disease burden, and patient preference is required to maximize efficacy, safety, and adherence to therapy. Latin American populations have unique attributes that must be considered as part of this process to improve clinical success and achieve patient goals. Acne is more common among patients with darker skin phototypes, in whom it is often associated with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring-the most important acne sequelae-potentially due to more frequent and more severe underlying inflammatory processes in this population. DISCUSSION: These data argue for an early and proactive approach to managing acne in these patients with agents that target the inflammatory processes that underlie acne and its sequelae. As a class, retinoids offer a spectrum of activity that may be useful in addressing the unique needs of Latin American populations. CONCLUSION: Trifarotene, a novel, selective retinoid, has been evaluated in relevant patient populations.",0

Experiences of and recommendations on clinical trial design in Alzheimer's disease from the participant's point of view: a mixed-methods study in two clinical trial centers in the Netherlands.,"INTRODUCTION: In the context of the development of pharmaceutical interventions, expectations and experiences of participants are essential. Their insights may be particularly helpful to address the challenges of recruiting and retaining participants for Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. We examined clinical trial participants' experiences to optimize trial design in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHOD: In this mixed-methods study, we included adults who participated in sponsor-initiated AD trials at Brain Research Center, a clinical trial organization in the Netherlands. Participants (N = 71, age 69 ± 6.5, 54%F, 19 cognitively normal (CN), 19 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 33 AD dementia) first completed an online survey. Diagnostic group differences were investigated using chi-square tests or one-way ANOVAs. Next, a subsample (N = 12; 8 = CN, 4 = MCI) participated in focus groups to gain in-depth insight into their opinions on optimizing trial design from a participants' point of view. Audio recordings from focus group interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by thematic content analysis by two independent researchers. RESULTS: Most reported motives for enrolment included ""to benefit future generations"" (89%), followed by ""for science"" (66%) and ""better monitoring"" (42%). Frequent suggestions for increasing willingness to participate included a smaller chance to receive placebo (n = 38, 54%), shorter travel times (n = 27, 38%), and sharing individual results of different assessments (n = 57, 80%), as well as receiving trial results (n = 52, 73). Highest visual analogue burden scores (0-100) were found for the lumbar puncture (M = 47.2, SD = 38.2) and cognitive assessments (M = 27.2, SD = 25.7). Results did not differ between diagnostic groups, nor between patient and caregiver participants (all p-values>.05). Two additional themes emerged from the focus groups: ""trial design,"" such as follow-up visit(s) after participating, and ""trial center,"" including the relevance of a professional and empathic staff. CONCLUSION: Relevant factors include expectation management and careful planning of high-burden assessments, provision of individual feedback, and prioritizing professionalism and empathy throughout conduct of the trial. Our findings provide insight into participants' priorities to increase willingness to participate and can be used to optimize trial success.",0
Patient and Public Acceptance of Digital Technologies in Health Care: Protocol for a Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Strokes pose a particular challenge to the health care system. Although stroke-related mortality has declined in recent decades, the absolute number of new strokes (incidence), stroke deaths, and survivors of stroke has increased. With the increasing need of neurorehabilitation and the decreasing number of professionals, innovations are needed to ensure adequate care. Digital technologies are increasingly used to meet patients' unfilled needs during their patient journey. Patients must adhere to unfamiliar digital technologies to engage in health interventions. Therefore, the acceptance of the benefits and burdens of digital technologies in health interventions is a key factor in implementing these innovations. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the development of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to weigh criteria that impact patient and public acceptance. Secondary study objectives are a benefit-burden assessment (estimation of the maximum acceptable burden of technical features and therapy-related characteristics for the patient or individual, eg, no human contact), overall comparison (assessment of the relative importance of attributes for comparing digital technologies), and adherence (identification of key attributes that influence patient adherence). The exploratory objectives include heterogeneity assessment and subgroup analysis. The methodological aims are to investigate the use of DCE. METHODS: To obtain information on the criteria impacting acceptance, a DCE will be conducted including 7 attributes based on formative qualitative research. Patients with stroke (experimental group) and the general population (control group) are surveyed. The final instrument includes 6 best-best choice tasks in partial design. The experimental design is a fractional-factorial efficient Bayesian design (D-error). A conditional logit regression model and mixed logistic regression models will be used for analysis. To consider the heterogeneity of subgroups, a latent class analysis and an analysis of heteroscedasticity will be performed. RESULTS: The literature review, qualitative preliminary study, survey development, and pretesting were completed. Data collection and analysis will be completed in the last quarter of 2023. CONCLUSIONS: Our results will inform decision makers about patients' and publics' acceptance of digital technologies used in innovative interventions. The patient preference information will improve decisions regarding the development, adoption, and pricing of innovative interventions. The behavioral changes in the choice of digital intervention alternatives are observable and can therefore be statistically analyzed. They can be translated into preferences, which define the value. This study will investigate the influences on the acceptance of digital interventions and thus support decisions and future research.

Co-creation of the Global Patient Experience Data Navigator: a multi-stakeholder initiative to ensure the patient voice is represented in health decision-making.,"BACKGROUND: Putting patients' needs and priorities at the forefront of healthcare initiatives and medical product development is critical to achieve outcomes that matter most to patients. This relies on the integration of early, meaningful patient engagement (PE) to learn what is important to patients, and collection of representative patient experience data (PXD). The increased number of PE/PXD efforts across global regulatory, health technology assessment, and healthcare systems is an important step forward to deliver improved health outcomes for patients. However, these initiatives are fragmented and lack integration, which is necessary to maximize efforts and reduce burden on patients. To overcome these challenges, the Global Patient Experience Data Navigator has been co-created by Patient Focused Medicines Development to provide practical resources that can facilitate and optimize PXD generation, collection, analysis, and dissemination for patient benefit and aims to be applicable across all therapeutic areas for all stakeholders. METHODS: Co-creation of the Navigator took place through an iterative process of validation and formalization driven by a diverse, multi-stakeholder working group with individuals who have varying knowledge/experience in PE/PXD. RESULTS: A series of workshops took place to conduct a gap analysis, develop a taxonomy model, and integrate existing frameworks. The collective insights led to the development of the Navigator consisting of four specific tools in the form of downloadable templates, which can be used to: (1) prioritize outcomes that matter most to patients and their caregivers; (2) select appropriate measurement methods for these outcomes; (3) identify when and why PXD is used throughout the product development cycle for each stakeholder; (4) identify when and why PXD is used throughout the healthcare process for each stakeholder. A public consultation was carried out to collect user feedback before the Navigator was made publicly available in December 2022. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, the Global Patient Experience Data Navigator is the only publicly available toolkit developed with a multi-stakeholder and disease-agnostic approach providing taxonomically grouped resources to optimize the collection and collation of PXD for patient benefit. Future work will aim to further engage patients by adding a PE dimension to the Navigator.",0
The Impact of Experience Versus Decision Aids on Patient Preference Toward Virtual Care.,"INTRODUCTION: Virtual care utilization has increased in recent years bringing questions of how to best inform patients regarding their use. Decision aids (DAs) are tools created to assist patients in making informed decisions about their health care. This study seeks to determine whether a DA or previous experience could better educate and influence patient's preference on virtual care. METHODS: One hundred fifty participants from an orthopedic clinic of a multi-hospital system were divided into three groups. Group 1 (Virtual Care Cohort) had at least one previous virtual care visit and was surveyed with the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ). Group 2 (In-person with Decision Aid) and Group 3 (In-person without Decision Aid) had no virtual care experience. Group 2 received a validated virtual care DA with a knowledge test. Both groups were also administered the TSQ. RESULTS: After the DA, patients improved their score on 3 of 4 virtual care knowledge questions. Each cohort demonstrated a positive perception of virtual care; however, the specific reasons for their favorable views varied. The DA cohort did not show increased preference toward virtual care compared with the non-DA group and only responded significantly higher regarding encounter comfort. Patients with previous experience in virtual care responded most favorably to the majority of survey questions regarding their virtual care preferences when compared with both virtual care naive cohorts. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We found that patient experience was the most important factor in influencing patient preference toward virtual care. Although the DA increased their virtual care knowledge it did not increase their preference; therefore, efforts should be placed at encouraging patient to experience virtual care.",0
Preferences for Monitoring Comprehensive Heart Failure Care: A Latent Class Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To measure preference heterogeneity for monitoring systems among patients with a chronic heart failure. METHODS: A best-worst scaling experiment (BWS case 3) was conducted among patients with chronic heart failure to assess preferences for hypothetical monitoring care scenarios. These were characterized by the attributes mobility, risk of death, risk of hospitalization, type and frequency of monitoring, risk of medical device, and system-relevant complications. A latent class analysis (LCA) was used to analyze and interpret the data. In addition, a market simulator was used to examine which treatment configurations participants in the latent classes preferred. RESULTS: Data from 278 respondents were analyzed. The LCA identified four heterogeneous classes. For class 1, the most decisive factor was mobility with a longer distance covered being most important. Class 2 respondents directed their attention toward attribute ""monitoring,"" with a preferred monitoring frequency of nine times per year. The attribute risk of hospitalization was most important for respondents of class 3, closely followed by risk of death. For class 4, however, risk of death was most important. A market simulation showed that, even with high frequency of monitoring, most classes preferred therapy with high improvement in mobility, mortality, and hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Using LCA, variations in preferences among different groups of patients with chronic heart failure were examined. This allows treatment alternatives to be adapted to individual needs of patients and patient groups. The findings of the study enhance clinical and allocative decision-making while elevating the quality of clinical data interpretation.",1
Assessing Patients' Preferences for Preventive Dental Care: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"Background It is crucial to recognize patients' behavioral responses to improve oral healthcare delivery. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) is typically used to measure service user preferences. The purpose of this study was to examine the preferences of the Saudi population regarding primary dental care using a DCE. Materials and methods An online DCE survey was distributed among adults aged 18 years and older living in Saudi Arabia. An orthogonal design was used to reduce the number of combinations while maintaining the main effects that reflect patient preferences. Respondents were presented with a reduced set of 10 cards (tasks), and each of the cards had two concepts (offers). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the sample characteristics. The coefficients were calculated based on discrete choice results on the Qualtrics platform. Results A total of 532 participants completed the survey. Among patients seeking a preventive dental visit, the ability to get an appointment was rated the most important influence on their decision with a relative importance of 41%, followed by the dental care provider (29%) and the dental clinic in relation to the sector and the fees (20%). The least important attribute was the waiting time in minutes, with a relative importance of 10%. Conclusion The study findings revealed that patients make trade-offs when deciding to receive primary dental care. Policymakers can use the study's findings to inform their decisions concerning dental clinic services. The study results suggest that it is possible to improve access to primary dental care by improving the accessibility of appointments.",1
"Real-world Prescription Patterns and Patient Satisfaction Regarding Maintenance Therapy of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: An Observational, Cross-sectional, Multicenter Study.","BACKGROUND/AIMS: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder that typically requires long-term maintenance therapy. However, little is known about patient preferences and satisfaction and real-world prescription patterns regarding maintenance therapy for GERD. METHODS: This observational, cross-sectional, multicenter study involved patients from 18 referral hospitals in Korea. We surveyed patients who had been prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for GERD for at least 90 days with a minimum follow-up duration of 1 year. The main outcome was overall patient satisfaction with different maintenance therapy modalities. RESULTS: A total of 197 patients were enrolled. Overall patient satisfaction, patient preferences, and GERD health-related quality of life scores did not significantly differ among the maintenance therapy modality groups. However, the on-demand therapy group experienced a significantly longer disease duration than the continuous therapy group. The continuous therapy group demonstrated a lower level of awareness of potential adverse effects associated with PPIs than the on-demand therapy group but received higher doses of PPIs than the on-demand therapy group. The prescribed doses of PPIs also varied based on the phenotype of GERD, with higher doses prescribed for non-erosive reflux disease than erosive reflux disease. CONCLUSION: Although overall patient satisfaction did not significantly differ among the different PPI maintenance therapy modality groups, awareness of potential adverse effects was significantly different between the on-demand and continuous therapy groups.",0
Safety in Teletriage by Nurses and Physicians in the United States and Israel: Narrative Review and Qualitative Study.,"BACKGROUND: The safety of telemedicine in general and telephone triage (teletriage) safety in particular have been a focus of concern since the 1970s. Today, telehealth, now subsuming teletriage, has a basic structure and process intended to promote safety. However, inadequate telehealth systems may also compromise patient safety. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated rapid but uneven telehealth growth, both technologically and professionally. Within 5-10 years, the field will likely be more technologically advanced; however, these advances may still outpace professional standards. The need for an evidence-based system is crucial and urgent. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore ways that developed teletriage systems produce safe outcomes by examining key system components and questioning long-held assumptions. METHODS: We examined safety by performing a narrative review of the literature using key terms concerning patient safety in teletriage. In addition, we conducted system analysis of 2 typical formal systems, physician led and nurse led, in Israel and the United States, respectively, and evaluated those systems' respective approaches to safety. Additionally, we conducted in-depth interviews with representative physicians and 1 nurse using a qualitative approach. RESULTS: The review of literature indicated that research on various aspects of telehealth and teletriage safety is still sparse and of variable quality, producing conflicting and inconsistent results. Researchers, possibly unfamiliar with this complicated field, use an array of poorly defined terms and appear to design studies based on unfounded assumptions. The interviews with health care professionals demonstrated several challenges encountered during teletriage, mainly making diagnosis from a distance, treating unfamiliar patients, a stressful atmosphere, working alone, and technological difficulties. However, they reported using several measures that help them make accurate diagnoses and reasonable decisions, thus keeping patient safety, such as using their expertise and intuition, using structured protocols, and considering nonmedical factors and patient preferences (shared decision-making). CONCLUSIONS: Remote encounters about acute, worrisome symptoms are time sensitive, requiring decision-making under conditions of uncertainty and urgency. Patient safety and safe professional practice are extremely important in the field of teletriage, which has a high potential for error. This underregulated subspecialty lacks adequate development and substantive research on system safety. Research may commingle terminology and widely different, ill-defined groups of decision makers with wide variation in decision-making skills, clinical training, experience, and job qualifications, thereby confounding results. The rapid pace of telehealth's technological growth creates urgency in identifying safe systems to guide developers and clinicians about needed improvements.",0
Perceived guideline clarity impacts guideline-concordant care for breast cancer screening in women age 40-49.,"BACKGROUND: Canadian and US Task Forces recommend against routine mammography screening for women age 40-49 at average breast cancer risk as harms outweigh benefits. Both suggest individualized decisions based on the relative value women place on potential screening benefits and harms. Population-based data reveal variation in primary care professionals (PCPs) mammography rates in this age group after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, highlighting the need to explore PCP screening perspectives and how this informs clinical behaviours. Results from this study will inform interventions that can improve guideline concordant breast screening for this age group. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were performed with PCPs in Ontario, Canada. Interviews were structured using the theoretical domains framework (TDF) to explore determinants of breast cancer screening best-practice behaviours: (1) risk assessment; (2) discussion regarding benefits and harms; and (3) referral for screening. ANALYSIS: Interviews were transcribed and analyzed iteratively until saturation. Transcripts were coded deductively by behaviour and TDF domain. Data that did not fit within a TDF code were coded inductively. The research team met repeatedly to identify potential themes that influenced or were important consequences of the screening behaviours. The themes were tested against further data, disconfirming cases, and different PCP demographics. RESULTS: Eighteen physicians were interviewed. The theme of perceived guideline clarity (a lack of clarity on guideline-concordant practices) influenced all behaviours and moderated the extent to which the risk assessment and discussion occurred. Many were unaware of how risk-assessment factored into the guidelines and/or did not perceive that a shared-care discussion was guideline-concordant. Deferral to patient preference (screening referral without a complete discussion of benefits and harms) occurred when the PCPs had low knowledge regarding harms and/or if they experienced regret (TDF domain: emotion) resulting from prior clinical experiences. Older providers described patient's influence impacting their decisions and physicians trained outside Canada, practicing in higher-resourced areas, and female physicians described being influenced by beliefs about consequences of benefits of screening. CONCLUSION: Perceived guideline clarity is an important driver of physician behaviour. Improving guideline concordant care should start by clarifying the guideline itself. Thereafter, targeted strategies include building skills in identifying and overcoming emotional factors and communication skills important for evidence-based screening discussions.",0
Advance care planning-family carer psychological distress and involvement in decision making: the ACTION trial.,"OBJECTIVES: Facilitated advance care planning (ACP) helps family carers' to be aware of patient preferences. It can improve family carers' involvement in decision making and their overall experiences at the end of life, as well as, reduce psychological stress. We investigated the effects of the ACTION Respecting Choices (RC) ACP intervention on the family carers' involvement in decision making in the last 3 months of the patients' life and on the family carers' psychological distress after 3 months of bereavement. METHODS: Over six European countries, a sample of 162 bereaved family carers returned a bereavement questionnaire. Involvement in decision making was measured with a single item of the Views of Informal Carers-Evaluation of Services Short Form questionnaire. Psychological distress was measured with the Impact of Event Scale (IES). RESULTS: No significant effect was found on family carers involvement in decision making in the last 3 months of the patients' life (95% CI 0.449 to 4.097). However, the probability of involvement in decision making was slightly higher in the intervention arm of the study (89.6% vs 86.7%; OR=1.357). Overall, no statistical difference was found between intervention and control group regarding the IES (M=34.1 (1.7) vs 31.8 (1.5); (95% CI -2.2 to 6.8)). CONCLUSION: The ACTION RC ACP intervention showed no significant effect on family carers' involvement in decision making or on subsequent psychological distress. More research is needed about (1) how family carers can be actively involved in ACP-conversations and (2) how to prepare family carers on their role in decision making.

Bone grafting techniques and materials for implant dentistry.,"Bone quality, volume, height and width all play a pivotal role in dental implant stability, success and survival. A lack of adequate bone can be overcome with various bone grafting procedures. Dependent on many factors, including the amount of bone required, the site of implant placement, patient preferences and clinician factors; the type of bone grafting material and procedure undertaken can vary. Supplemental bone can be sourced from a variety of sources, including autogenous, allogenous and xenograft bone. Dependent on the source of the bone, it will have different properties in aiding bone formation, as well as being presented in different formulations, such as bone particles or bone blocks.The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of bone grafting indications, materials and types of bone grafting techniques that can be utilised to aid dental implant provision. It also discusses the properties needed to ensure optimal success of guided bone regeneration techniques.",0
Meeting the Needs of Patient Preferences in Imaging.,"Healthcare continues to transition toward a patient-centered paradigm, where patients are active in medical decisions. Fully embracing this new paradigm means updating how clinical guidelines are formulated, accounting for patient preferences for medical care. Recently, several societies have incorporated patient preference evidence in their updated clinical practice guidelines, and patients in their expert panels. To fully transition to a patient-centered-paradigm, imaging organizations should rethink the formulation of clinical guidelines, accounting for patient preference evidence.",0
Indefinite Anticoagulant Therapy for First Unprovoked Venous Thromboembolism : A Cost-Effectiveness Study.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines recommend indefinite anticoagulation for a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE). OBJECTIVE: To estimate the benefit-harm tradeoffs of indefinite anticoagulation in patients with a first unprovoked VTE. DESIGN: Markov modeling study. DATA SOURCES: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses for the long-term risks and case-fatality rates of recurrent VTE and major bleeding. Published literature for costs, quality of life, and other clinical events. TARGET POPULATION: Patients with a first unprovoked VTE who have completed 3 to 6 months of initial anticoagulant treatment. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Canadian health care public payer. INTERVENTION: Indefinite anticoagulation with direct oral anticoagulants. OUTCOME MEASURES: Recurrent VTE events, major bleeding events, costs in 2022 Canadian dollars (CAD), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: When compared with discontinuing anticoagulation after initial treatment in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients aged 55 years, indefinite anticoagulation prevented 368 recurrent VTE events, which included 14 fatal pulmonary emboli, but induced an additional 114 major bleeding events, which included 30 intracranial hemorrhages and 11 deaths from bleeding. Indefinite anticoagulation cost CAD $16 014 more per person and did not increase QALYs (-0.075 per person). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Model results were most sensitive to the case-fatality rate of major bleeding and the annual risk for major bleeding during extended anticoagulation. LIMITATION: The model assumed that risks for recurrent VTE and major bleeding measured in clinical trials at 1 year remained constant during extended anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should use shared decision making to incorporate individual patient preferences and values when considering treatment duration for unprovoked VTE.

"Impact of a moulded pureed diet on taste, appearance, recognisability, and overall liking among patients in an acute hospital.","INTRODUCTION: Hospital meals potentially influence patients' nutritional, physical, and emotional well-being during their admission. Patients on pureed diets report poorer meal satisfaction, due to taste, appearance, and recognisability, potentially impacting on their nutritional status. This study compared whether a moulded pureed diet made from modified maize starch led to improved taste, appearance, recognisability, and overall liking, compared to an unmoulded pureed diet made from potato starch in an acute hospital. METHODS: Patients on texture-modified diets were recruited and presented with two pureed diets - unmoulded and moulded. Participants were asked to identify meat and vegetable dishes prior to eating. After the meal, participants indicated their diet preference in terms of appearance, taste, and overall liking. RESULTS: 145 participants were recruited, of which 126 completed data collection. 86% correctly identified moulded meat dishes, 69% correctly identified moulded vegetable dishes, with an overall 77% accuracy in identifying moulded puree side dishes. On unmoulded puree side dishes, participants correctly identified 25% of meat dishes, 4% of vegetable dishes, with an overall accuracy of 14%. In terms of preference, the moulded puree was preferred, with 81% for appearance, 76% for taste and 75% for overall preference. When participants had differing preferences for appearance and taste (e.g., prefers unmoulded puree appearance and moulded puree taste), 95% of them subsequently aligned their overall preference with their taste preference (i.e., overall preferred moulded pureed diet). This suggests that taste has a stronger influence on overall preference compared to appearance. DISCUSSION: Findings indicate that a moulded pureed diet made from modified maize starch led to improved recognisability, taste, appearance, and overall liking compared to an unmoulded pureed diet made from potato starch. Taste had a stronger influence on overall preference compared to appearance. These findings capture patient preferences and may have implications on how hospital pureed diets may be improved, potentially improving patient nutrition and health outcomes.",0
Should Antihypertensive Medications Be Routinely Administered in the Nighttime Instead of Daytime?,"The optimal timing for administering antihypertensive medications remains a topic of debate. This review examines the effectiveness of nighttime vs daytime administration of antihypertensive medications in controlling blood pressure (BP). The MAPEC and Hygia trials suggest that nighttime dosing achieves better BP control and significantly lowers cardiovascular events. However, concerns about methodology and generalizability have been raised. In contrast, the HARMONY and TIME trials found no significant difference in BP control nor cardiovascular outcomes between daytime and nighttime dosing. Current research suggests that the timing of antihypertensive medication administration may not be a crucial factor. Therefore, the decision about the timing of antihypertensive medications administration should be individualized, taking into account patient preference and clinical context, in order to promote consistent compliance.",0
A Preference-Based Value Assessment of the Fear of COVID-19 Contagion.,"PURPOSE: To assess the preference-based value of the fear of COVID-19 contagion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a web-based, cross-sectional discrete choice experiment among 544 US adults. We used a Bayesian efficient design to generate choice sets. Each choice set comprised two hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine options characterized by seven attributes: chance of COVID-19 infection, chance of having severe symptoms from COVID-19 infection, vaccine protection duration, chance of mild to moderate adverse events from vaccination, chance of serious adverse events from vaccination, chance of future exposure to COVID-19 after vaccination, and out-of-pocket cost. We used mixed logit (ML) and latent class (LC) models to analyze data. Furthermore, we calculated the willingness-to-pay for eliminating the chance of future exposure to COVID-19, shedding light on the value attributed to the fear of contagion. RESULTS: The ML model demonstrated all attributes, including the chance of future exposure to COVID-19, were statistically significant. The participants were willing to pay approximately $13,046 to eliminate the chance of future exposure to COVID-19 or their fear of contagion when COVID-19 was still pandemic. The LC model unveiled two participant classes with distinct preference weights for the chance of future exposure to COVID-19 and out-of-pocket cost attributes. Nevertheless, the chance of future exposure to COVID-19 exposure held a significant degree of importance in both classes. CONCLUSION: The chance of future exposure to COVID-19 exposure or fear of contagion was a significant element in the value assessment of COVID-19 vaccines. Further studies should be conducted to verify the value of fear of contagion and include it in the value assessment of healthcare technologies for infectious diseases.",1
Patient preferences and decision-making when considering surgery for musculoskeletal disorders: A mixed methods systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION: The burden of Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) is large. Surgery is an important management option but the factors that shape patients' surgical decisions are not well understood. As prior reviews have explored only single data types or conditions, a mixed methods appraisal across the musculoskeletal spectrum was undertaken. METHODS: A mixed-methods systematic, convergent segregated approach was used, with PubMed, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINHAL), Embase and PsycINFO searched to identify studies of adult patients' decisions about whether to undergo surgery. A narrative synthesis was conducted, with identified themes integrated across quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies. RESULTS: Forty-six studies were included (24 quantitative, 19 qualitative and three mixed methods), with four decision-making themes identified (symptoms, sociodemographic and health factors, information and perceptions). Decision-making involves a complex interaction of individual sociodemographic, health and symptom information, integrated with individual perceptions of candidacy and surgical expectations. While most studies investigated hip and knee surgery, across all included conditions, patients are more likely to favour surgery if symptoms and/or dysfunction are higher, and if perceptions of surgical candidacy and processes (outcomes, inconvenience, and risk) are favourable. Other factors including age, general health, race, financial context, professional and non-professional communication, and information sources also impact decision-making but exert a less consistent impact upon the propensity to prefer surgery. CONCLUSION: Patients are more likely to choose surgery for MSD when they have higher levels of symptoms or dysfunction and positive perceptions of surgical suitability and expectations. Other factors important to individuals, have a less consistent impact upon the propensity to prefer surgery. These findings have potential to aid the efficient referral of patients to orthopaedics. More research is needed to validate these findings across the spectrum of MSD.",1
Neck Rejuvenation.,"A common complaint of patients presenting for facial cosmetic evaluation is the appearance of aging in the neck. Specifically, vertical lines visible at the medial borders of the platysma muscles - known as platysmal bands - accumulation of fat in the submental area, and effacement of the cervicomental angle are frequently mentioned. Multiple options with varying degrees of invasiveness are available to address these concerns, such as neck lift with or without platysmaplasty, submental liposuction, deoxycholic acid injection, cryotherapy, botulinum toxin injection, and skin resurfacing, among others. Determining the appropriate treatment modality will depend on patient preference and goals, budget, general health, and underlying anatomy. Frequently, these procedures will be combined with other interventions, like face lifting and blepharoplasty, or dermal filler injections. Surgeons will often need to pair with allied healthcare personnel, such as injection nurses and aestheticians, in order to maximize patients' results and satisfaction.",0
Outcomes that matter most to burn patients: A national multicentre survey study in the Netherlands.,"BACKGROUND: The use of patient-reported outcomes to improve burn care increases. Little is known on burn patients' views on what outcomes are most important, and about preferences regarding online Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). Therefore, this study assessed what outcomes matter most to patients, and gained insights into patient preferences towards the use of online PROMs. METHODS: Adult patients (≥18 years old), 3-36 months after injury completed a survey measuring importance of outcomes, separately for three time periods: during admission, short-term (<6 months) and long-term (6-24 months) after burn injury. Both open and closed-ended questions were used. Furthermore, preferences regarding the use of patient-reported outcome measures in burn care were queried. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients were included (response rate: 27%). 'Not having pain' and 'good wound healing' were identified as very important outcomes. Also, 'physical functioning at pre-injury level', 'being independent' and 'taking care of yourself' were considered very important outcomes. The top-ten of most important outcomes largely overlapped in all three time periods. Most patients (84%) had no problems with online questionnaires, and many (67%) indicated that it should take up to 15 minutes. Patients' opinions differed widely on the preferred frequency of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Not having pain and good wound healing were considered very important during the whole recovery of burns; in addition, physical functioning at pre-injury level, being independent, and taking care of yourself were deemed very important in the short and long-term. These outcomes are recommended to be used in burn care and research, although careful selection of outcomes remains crucial as patients prefer online questionnaires up to 15 minutes.",0
Patient and researcher stakeholder preferences for use of electronic health record data: a qualitative study to guide the design and development of a platform to honor patient preferences.,"OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study aimed to understand patient and researcher perspectives regarding consent and data-sharing preferences for research and a patient-centered system to manage consent and data-sharing preferences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted focus groups with patient and researcher participants recruited from three academic health centers via snowball sampling. Discussions focused on perspectives on the use of electronic health record (EHR) data for research. Themes were identified through consensus coding, starting from an exploratory framework. RESULTS: We held two focus groups with patients (n = 12 patients) and two with researchers (n = 8 researchers). We identified two patient themes (1-2), one theme common to patients and researchers (3), and two researcher themes (4-5). Themes included (1) motivations for sharing EHR data, (2) perspectives on the importance of data-sharing transparency, (3) individual control of personal EHR data sharing, (4) how EHR data benefits research, and (5) challenges researchers face using EHR data. DISCUSSION: Patients expressed a tension between the benefits of their data being used in studies to benefit themselves/others and avoiding risk by limiting data access. Patients resolved this tension by acknowledging they would often share their data but wanted greater transparency on its use. Researchers expressed concern about incorporating bias into datasets if patients opted out. CONCLUSIONS: A research consent and data-sharing platform must consider two competing goals: empowering patients to have more control over their data and maintaining the integrity of secondary data sources. Health systems and researchers should increase trust-building efforts with patients to engender trust in data access and use.",0
Contemporary surgical and procedural management of benign prostatic hyperplasia.,"Interventions for benign prostatic hyperplasia have evolved from transurethral resection of the prostate and simple prostatectomy to a myriad of office-based and operating-room procedures. The contemporary approach involves matching the right procedure to the right patient, choosing on the basis of prostate characteristics, patient preference, and urologist expertise. This review details currently available and guideline-backed surgical and procedural treatments.",0
A qualitative exploration of allied health providers' perspectives on cultural humility in palliative and end-of-life care.,"BACKGROUND: Cultural factors, including religious or cultural beliefs, shape patients' death and dying experiences, including palliative and end-of-life (EOL) care preferences. Allied health providers must understand their patients' cultural preferences to support them in palliative and EOL care effectively. Cultural humility is a practice which requires allied health providers to evaluate their own values, biases, and assumptions and be open to learning from others, which may enhance cross-cultural interactions by allowing providers to understand patients' perceptions of and preferences for their health, illness, and dying. However, there is limited knowledge of how allied health providers apply cultural humility in palliative and EOL care within a Canadian context. Thus, this study describes Canadian allied health providers' perspectives of cultural humility practice in palliative and EOL care settings, including how they understand the concept and practice of cultural humility, and navigate relationships with patients who are palliative or at EOL and from diverse cultural backgrounds. METHODS: In this qualitative interpretive description study, remote interviews were conducted with allied health providers who currently or recently practiced in a Canadian palliative or EOL care setting. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using interpretive descriptive analysis techniques. RESULTS: Eleven allied health providers from the following disciplines participated: speech-language pathology, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and dietetics. Three themes were identified: (1) Interpreting and understanding of cultural humility in palliative and EOL care (i.e., recognizing positionality, biases and preconceived notions and learning from patients); (2) Values, conflicts, and ethical uncertainties when practicing cultural humility at EOL between provider and patient and family, and within the team and constraints/biases within the system preventing culturally humble practices; (3) The 'how to' of cultural humility in palliative and EOL care (i.e., ethical decision-making in palliative and EOL care, complexities within the care team, and conflicts and challenges due to contextual/system-level factors). CONCLUSIONS: Allied health providers used various strategies to manage relationships with patients and practice cultural humility, including intra- and inter-personal strategies, and contextual/health systems enablers. Conflicts and challenges they encountered related to cultural humility practices may be addressed through relational or health system strategies, including professional development and decision-making support.",0
Patient perspectives on teledentistry and face-to-face doctor interaction during orthodontic treatment.,"INTRODUCTION: Teledentistry in orthodontics is growing, yet patient preferences for its use is unknown. This study aimed to determine the perceived value of doctor-to-patient face-to-face interaction, convenience, and attitudes toward specific uses of teledentistry among orthodontic patients. METHODS: Private practice orthodontists emailed an electronic survey to active patients. Patients aged ≥18 years completed the survey regarding their treatment. Parents of patients aged <18 years completed a separate survey regarding their child's treatment. Responses were compared on the basis of patient characteristics (adult vs child, braces vs clear aligners, etc). RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-seven respondents from 8 orthodontic practices participated in the survey. Eighty-five percent of parents considered face-to-face interaction important, and 85% said that their child's treatment fit conveniently into their schedule. Adult responses were 86% and 89%, respectively. Adult preference for face-to-face was significantly higher than parents of adolescent patients (83% vs 78%; P = 0.038). Adults treated with clear aligners were less likely to strongly agree that their treatment fitted conveniently in their schedule (51% vs 76% in braces; P = 0.0490) and were more likely to be interested in using teledentistry (27% vs 18% in braces; P = 0.0429). CONCLUSIONS: Most orthodontic patients prefer to be seen face-to-face. This is due to the high value placed on face-to-face interaction with the orthodontist. Most patients do not consider their treatment inconvenient. Patients prefer that teledentistry be used to enhance communication as opposed to replacing face-to-face interaction. Implementing teledentistry in orthodontics should be applied on a patient-to-patient basis with continued emphasis on the doctor-patient relationship.",0
Lifetime Management of Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis in the Era of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular disease. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) using mechanical valves has been the preferred treatment for younger patients, but bioprosthetic valves are gaining favour to avoid anticoagulation with warfarin. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was approved in recent years for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis in intermediate- and low-risk patients as an alternative to SAVR. The longer life expectancy of these groups of patients might exceed the durability of the TAVR or SAVR bioprosthetic valves. Therefore, many patients need 2 or even 3 interventions during their lifetime. Because it has important implications on the feasibility of subsequent procedures, the decision between opting for SAVR or TAVR as the primary procedure requires thorough consideration by the heart team, incorporating patient preferences, clinical indicators, and anatomic aspects. If TAVR is favoured initially, selecting the valve type and determining the implantation level should be conducted, aiming for positive outcomes in the index intervention and keeping in mind the potential for subsequent TAVR-in-TAVR procedures. When SAVR is selected as the primary procedure, the operator must make choices regarding the valve type and the potential need for aortic root enlargement, with the intention of facilitating future valve-in-valve interventions. This narrative review examines the existing evidence concerning the lifelong management of severe aortic stenosis, delving into available treatment strategies, particularly emphasising the initial procedure's selection and its impact on subsequent interventions.",0
Health-related quality of life in early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma: a longitudinal analysis of the ABVD arm in the randomized controlled trial HD.6.,"Early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma has become one of the most curable hematologic malignancies. Depending upon the disease location, possible toxicities, and patient preference, chemotherapy alone with ABVD remains an accepted treatment modality for this disease. There remains a paucity of data regarding the longitudinal trajectory of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients treated for HL. The impact of disease and treatment on HRQoL is increasingly important to understand as the number of long-term survivors increases. We report the longitudinal HRQoL using data prospectively collected from diagnosis up to 10 years post-treatment in the ABVD arm of the HD.6 randomized controlled trial for early-stage HL patients (N=169). We analyzed HRQoL using the EORTC QLQ-C30 collected at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after completion of chemotherapy and yearly up to year 10. Clinically and statistically significant improvements were noted for specific domains including emotional (3 months post-treatment), social (12 months post-treatment) and financial functioning (2 years post-treatment), and the specific symptom of fatigue (6 months post-treatment) during the follow-up period. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective, longitudinal analysis of HRQoL specifically among patients with early-stage HL treated with ABVD therapy alone. Although improvements were noted, sustained clinically and statistically significant improvements were noted only in select symptoms emphasizing the need to better understand and optimize HRQoL among this patient group.",0
Quantifying stakeholders' preference for implantable medical devices in China: a discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to gain insight into each attribute as presented in the value of implantable medical devices, quantify attributes' strength and their relative importance, and identify the determinants of stakeholders' preferences. METHODS: A mixed-methods design was used to identify attributes and levels reflecting stakeholders' preference toward the value of implantable medical devices. This design combined literature reviewing, expert's consultation, one-on-one interactions with stakeholders, and a pilot testing. Based on the design, six attributes and their levels were settled. Among 144 hypothetical profiles, 30 optimal choice sets were developed, and healthcare professionals (decision-makers, health technology assessment experts, hospital administrators, medical doctors) and patients as stakeholders in China were surveyed. A total of 134 respondents participated in the survey. Results were analyzed by mixed logit model and conditional logit model. RESULTS: The results of the mixed logit model showed that all the six attributes had a significant impact on respondents' choices on implantable medical devices. Respondents were willing to pay the highest for medical devices that provided improvements in clinical safety, followed by increased clinical effectiveness, technology for treating severe diseases, improved implement capacity, and innovative technology (without substitutes). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of DCE will improve the current evaluation on the value of implantable medical devices in China and provide decision-makers with the relative importance of the criteria in pricing and reimbursement decision-making of implantable medical devices.",1
The Impact of Substantial Improvements in HbA1c and Weight Loss on the Medication Preferences of People with Type 2 Diabetes.,"PURPOSE: To quantify the preferences of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) for treatment attributes of a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) versus an injectable GLP-1 RA medication profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Injection-naive people taking oral medications for T2D in the US and UK completed a web survey including a discrete choice experiment to quantify patients' preferences for five treatment attributes: delivery system, frequency of nausea, frequency of hypoglycemia, HbA1c reduction, and weight reduction. Attributes and levels were based on head-to-head clinical trial data of tirzepatide 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg versus semaglutide 1mg. Preference data were analyzed separately by country using multinomial mixed logit (MXL) models. MXL parameters were used to estimate the predicted preference for each tirzepatide dose versus semaglutide 1mg. Direct preferences for each dose of tirzepatide versus semaglutide 1mg were elicited. RESULTS: Participants (N=620) in the US (N=301) and UK (N=319) were 50.8% and 50.5% female with mean ages of 60.7 years and 58.9 years, respectively. The order and magnitude of relative attribute importance (RAI) scores differed between countries. HbA1c reduction (26.3%) had the greatest impact on US participants' preferences, and hypoglycemia (32.8%) did among UK participants. Attribute-level marginal utility results indicated preferences for greater HbA1c improvements, the single-use pre-filled pen, lower hypoglycemia, greater weight reductions, and lower frequency of nausea. Assuming the availability of only tirzepatide or semaglutide 1mg, the predicted preference for tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15mg) in the US is 95.6% (vs 4.4% for semaglutide 1mg) and in the UK was 86.3% (vs 13.7% for semaglutide 1mg). CONCLUSION: HbA1c reduction, frequency of hypoglycemia, and weight reduction are key drivers of preferences among people with T2D when considering medication options. Overall, people with T2D are likely to prefer the tirzepatide over the semaglutide 1mg medication profiles.",1
The Patient preference predictor and the objection from higher-order preferences.,"Recently, Jardas et al have convincingly defended the patient preference predictor (PPP) against a range of autonomy-based objections. In this response, I propose a new autonomy-based objection to the PPP that is not explicitly discussed by Jardas et al I call it the 'objection from higher-order preferences'. Even if this objection is not sufficient reason to reject the PPP, the objection constitutes a pro tanto reason that is at least as powerful as the ones discussed by Jardas et al.",0
Patient and General Population Preferences Regarding the Benefits and Harms of Treatment for Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Patient preferences for treatment outcomes are important to guide decision-making in clinical practice, but little is known about the preferences of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient preferences regarding the attributed benefits and harms of systemic treatments for mHSPC and preference heterogeneity between individuals and specific subgroups. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted an online discrete choice experiment (DCE) preference survey among 77 patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) and 311 men from the general population in Switzerland between November 2021 and August 2022. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We evaluated preferences and preference heterogeneity related to survival benefits and treatment-related adverse effects using mixed multinomial logit models and estimated the maximum survival time participants were willing to trade to avert specific adverse effects. We further assessed characteristics associated with different preference patterns via subgroup and latent class analyses. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Patients with mPC showed an overall stronger preference for survival benefits in comparison to men from the general population (p = 0.004), with substantial preference heterogeneity between individuals within the two samples (both p < 0.001). There was no evidence of differences in preferences for men aged 45-65 yr versus ≥65 yr, patients with mPC in different disease stages or with different adverse effect experiences, or general population participants with and without experiences with cancer. Latent class analyses suggested the presence of two groups strongly preferring either survival or the absence of adverse effects, with no specific characteristic clearly associated with belonging to either group. Potential biases due to participant selection, cognitive burden, and hypothetical choice scenarios may limit the study results. CONCLUSIONS: Given the relevant heterogeneity in participant preferences regarding the benefits and harms of treatment for mHSPC, patient preferences should be explicitly discussed during decision-making in clinical practice and reflected in clinical practice guidelines and regulatory assessment regarding treatment for mHSPC. PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined the preferences (values and perceptions) of patients and men from the general population regarding the benefits and harms of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. There were large differences between men in how they balanced the expected survival benefits and potential adverse effects. While some men strongly valued survival, others more strongly valued the absence of adverse effects. Therefore, it is important to discuss patient preferences in clinical practice.",1
Patients' Preference for Participation in Medical Decision-Making: Secondary Analysis of the BEDSIDE-OUTSIDE Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Patients may prefer different levels of involvement in decision-making regarding their medical care which may influence their medical knowledge. OBJECTIVE: We investigated associations of patients' decisional control preference (DCP) with their medical knowledge, ward round performance measures (e.g., duration, occurrence of sensitive topics), and perceived quality of care measures (e.g., trust in the healthcare team, satisfaction with hospital stay). DESIGN: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled multicenter trial conducted between 2017 and 2019 at 3 Swiss teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients that were hospitalized for inpatient care. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was patients' subjective average knowledge of their medical care (rated on a visual analog scale from 0 to 100). We classified patients as active, collaborative, and passive according to the Control Preference Scale. Data collection was performed before, during, and after the ward round. KEY RESULTS: Among the 761 included patients, those with a passive DCP had a similar subjective average (mean ± SD) knowledge (81.3 ± 19.4 points) compared to patients with a collaborative DCP (78.7 ± 20.3 points) and active DCP (81.3 ± 21.5 points), p = 0.25. Regarding patients' trust in physicians and nurses, we found that patients with an active vs. passive DCP reported significantly less trust in physicians (adjusted difference, - 5.08 [95% CI, - 8.69 to - 1.48 points], p = 0.006) and in nurses (adjusted difference, - 3.41 [95% CI, - 6.51 to - 0.31 points], p = 0.031). Also, patients with an active vs. passive DCP were significantly less satisfied with their hospital stay (adjusted difference, - 7.17 [95% CI, - 11.01 to - 3.34 points], p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with active DCP have lower trust in the healthcare team and lower overall satisfaction despite similar perceived medical knowledge. The knowledge of a patient's DCP may help to individualize patient-centered care. A personalized approach may improve the patient-physician relationship and increase patients' satisfaction with medical care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03210987).",0
Immunotherapy in oncology and the kidneys: a clinical review of the evaluation and management of kidney immune-related adverse events.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are now widely used in the treatment of many cancers, and currently represent the standard of care for multiple malignancies. These agents enhance the T cell immune response to target cancer tissues, and have demonstrated considerable benefits for cancer outcomes. However, despite these improved outcomes, there are important kidney immune-related adverse events (iRAEs) associated with ICI. Acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis remains the most frequent kidney iRAE, however glomerular lesions and electrolytes disturbances are increasingly being recognized and reported. In this review, we summarize clinical features and identify risk factors for kidney iRAEs, and discuss the current understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms. We highlight the evidence basis for guideline-recommended management of ICI-related kidney injury as well as gaps in current knowledge. We advocate for judicious use of kidney biopsy to identify ICI-associated kidney injury, and early use of corticosteroid treatment where appropriate. Selected patients may also be candidates for re-challenge with ICI therapy after a kidney iRAE, in view of current data on recurrent rates of kidney injury. Risk of benefits of re-challenge must be considered on an individual considering patient preferences and prognosis. Lastly, we review current knowledge of ICI use in the setting of patients with end-stage kidney disease, including kidney transplant recipients and those receiving dialysis, which suggest that these patients should not be summarily excluded from the potential benefits of these cancer therapies.",0
"Understanding rural-urban differences in veterans' internet access, use and patient preferences for telemedicine.","BACKGROUND: The expansion of telemedicine (e.g., telephone or video) in the Veterans Health Administration (VA) raises concerns for health care disparities between rural and urban veterans. Factors impeding telemedicine use (e.g., broadband, digital literacy, age) disproportionally affect rural veterans. PURPOSE: To examine veteran-reported broadband access, internet use, familiarity with, and preferences for telemedicine stratified by residential rurality. METHODS: Three hundred fifty veterans with a VA primary care visit in March 2022 completed a 30-min computer-assisted telephone interview. The sampling design stratified veterans by residential rurality (i.e., rural or urban) and how primary care was delivered (i.e., in-person or by video). Counts and weighted percentages are reported. FINDINGS: After accounting for survey weights, 96.2% of respondents had in-home internet access and 89.5% reported functional connection speeds. However, rural- compared to urban-residing veterans were less likely to experience a telemedicine visit in the past year (74.1% vs. 85.2%; p = 0.02). When comparing telemedicine to in-person visits, rural versus urban-residing veterans rated them not as good (45.3% vs. 36.8%), just as good (51.1% vs. 53.1%), or better (3.5% vs. 10.0%) (p = 0.05). To make telemedicine visits easier, veterans, regardless of where they lived, recommended technology training (46.4%), help accessing the internet (26.1%), or provision of an internet-enabled device (25.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Though rural-residing veterans were less likely to experience a telemedicine visit, the same actionable facilitators to improve telemedicine access were reported regardless of residential rurality. Importantly, technology training was most often recommended. Policy makers, patient advocates, and other stakeholders should consider novel initiatives to provide training resources.",0
The importance of reminders and patient preferences to improve inhaler technique in older adults with COPD.,"Objectives: Medication non-adherence in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is common. The aim is to evaluate the efficacy of two interventions to improve the inhalation technique (IT) in patients with pulmonary disease is common. Also determine optimal IT reminder time and to test the role of preferences in the intervention selection. Method: 726 pulmonary disease in common patients (consecutive sampling) from two trials: 1) TECEPOC-study (patients' preference trial/comprehensive cohort design) 2) TIEPOC-study (randomised controlled trial). Interventions: intervention-A (ad-hoc leaflet with instructions about correct IT according Spanish Respiratory Society), intervention B (intervention A+ individual training by instructors). Four visits were performed (baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months). Data on IT, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, quality of life and respiratory drugs were recorded. Analysis under intention to treat principle. Multivariate analysis was conducted to measure the potential modifying factors of improvement in the IT along follow-up. Results: 660 patients (90.9%) did not perform a correct IT at baseline 89.75% with Handihaler, 86.95% with Turbuhaler, 84.75% with Accuhaler and 87.35% with pMDI. At 12 months, 221 patients 29.9% performed correctly the IT; a decrease in the slope of the curve (correct IT) was detected at 3 months follow-up. Intervention B was the most effective in both trials compared to control group or intervention A, regardless of preferences: 1) TECEPOC Study (preference trial): Intervention B versus control group, NNT = 3.22 (IC95%, 2.27-5.52); and versus Intervention A, NNT = 3.57 (CI95%, 2.41-6.8). Preferences improved 6.7% in the correct IT without statistical significance. 2) TIEPOC Study (randomized controlled trial): Intervention B versus control group, NNT = 1.74 (IC95%, 1.47-2.17), and versus intervention A, NNT = 3.33 (CI 95%, 2.43-5.55). No differences were measured between Intervention A and control group. Conclusion: Individual training significantly improves IT. Reminders every 3 months are recommended. Preferences do not influence the intervention effectiveness.",0
How do patients value features of biological medicine in rheumatoid arthritis? A discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to quantify the preference of the patients regarding biological DMARDs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients' preferences were assessed using a discrete choice experiment. Eighteen different surveys describing eight attributes were designed using experimental design methods. Each survey presented eight choice tasks with two options for patients to choose one. A conditional logit model was used to calculate relative importance and willingness to pay. Subgroup analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of the patients' characteristic on their preferences. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included in the study. All attributes had significant effects on the patients' choices. The most important feature was the ability to preserve physical function. The least important feature was the route of administration. Surprisingly, the out-of-pocket cost was one of the last priorities for respondents. According to the relative importance calculations, 80% of the patients' preferences can be obtained by clinical attributes. Based on subgroup analysis, the most important patient characteristic that affected their choices was the monthly out-of-pocket history. CONCLUSIONS: Different features of treatment had different effects on the patients' preferences. Quantification of the impact of each attribute not only revealed their relative importance but also determined the trade-off rate among them.",1
Oncoplastic Techniques and Tricks to Have in Your Toolbox.,"Oncoplastic breast reconstruction seeks to address partial mastectomy defects in the setting of breast-conserving surgery to achieve superior aesthetic outcomes with comparable oncologic safety compared with traditional breast conservation surgery. As such, oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery has grown in popularity in recent years. Several techniques have been used to displace the volume with the remaining breast tissue or replace it with local soft-tissue options, with decision-making guided by patient and tumor characteristics, additional treatment requirements, patient preference, and available tissue resources. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of considerations in oncoplastic breast reconstruction with a focus on techniques and tips to achieve optimal outcomes.",0
Mailing abortion pills does not delay care: A cohort study comparing mailed to in-person dispensing of abortion medications in the United States.,"OBJECTIVE: Given the substantial barriers to abortion access in the United States, many clinics now mail patients abortion medications. We examined whether dispensing the medications by mail prolonged time to medication use. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed data from no-test medication abortions with medication provided either by mail or in a clinic from 11 United States clinics from February 2020 to January 2021. We examined mean number of days from patients' first contact with the clinic to mifepristone ingestion, its two-component intervals (first contact to medication dispensing and dispensing to mifepristone ingestion), and pregnancy duration at mifepristone ingestion. We used Poisson regression to compare mean outcomes across three dispensing methods: in-person, mailed from the clinic, and mailed from a mail-order pharmacy. RESULTS: Among the 2600 records, patients took mifepristone on average at 49 days of gestation (95% CI, 47-51) and 7 days (95% CI, 4-10) after first contact. Mean time from first contact to mifepristone ingestion was 6 days when medications were dispensed in-person and 9 days when mailed (p = 0.38). While time from first contact to dispensing was similar across methods (6 days in-person, 5 days mailed, p = 0.77), more time elapsed from dispensing to mifepristone ingestion when medications were mailed (4 days from clinic, 5 days from mail-order pharmacy) versus dispensed in-person (0.3 days, p < 0.001). Time to mifepristone ingestion was shorter with higher pregnancy duration. Pregnancy duration at ingestion was similar across methods (48 days in-person, 50 days mailed). CONCLUSIONS: Mailing medications did not significantly prolong time from patients' first contact with the clinic to mifepristone ingestion or increase pregnancy duration at mifepristone ingestion. IMPLICATIONS: Abortion providers should offer a range of medication abortion dispensing options, prioritizing patient preference.",0

[Participation of Patients in the Development of Clinical Guidelines: A Selective Country Comparison in a Narrative Review].,"AIM: A clinical practice guideline aims to optimize patient care by recommending diagnostic or treatment pathways, based on the best available research and practical experience. Therefore, the needs and preferences of patients and their families should be incorporated. The aim of this study was to examine regulations and standards of patient involvement in guideline development, using a selective comparison of countries. METHOD: Information was extracted from publicly available websites and guidelines development manuals for the United Kingdom (UK), the United States, Canada, and Australia. They were compared and discussed in a narrative review. RESULTS: In the UK, at least two people from among patients or the public must be involved in all guideline development committees and during all stages of the development process. The US National Academy of Medicine recommends active participation in guideline development groups by patients with disease-specific experience and patient representatives from the public. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care wants patient preferences to be involved, especially in the development of final guideline recommendations and usability testing. In Australia, guidelines receive the approval or seal of approval of the National Health and Medical Research Council if at least one patient representative can be shown to have been a member of the committee and to have been involved in the entire process of guideline development. CONCLUSION: The selective country comparison shows that patient involvement in guideline development and the binding nature of the rules vary considerably, and that there are no uniform standards for involvement. Many issues of involvement are unresolved, and special sensitivity will be needed to bring together the life and experiences of patients/laypersons and the medical system on an equal footing.",0
Study protocol for a cross-sectional online survey investigating patient preferences and experiences of waiting for elective cardiac surgery.,"INTRODUCTION: Being on a waiting list for elective (planned) cardiac surgery can be physically and psychologically challenging for patients. Research suggests that stress associated with waiting for surgery is dependent on different individual and contextual factors. However, most data on patients' experiences of waiting for surgery and preferences for waiting list management derives from non-cardiac clinical populations. The aim of the current study is to explore patients' experiences of being on a waiting list for elective cardiac surgery, and their views on how the waiting experience could be improved in the future. This work will inform the patient management strategy during the waiting period for surgery across the four major hospitals in London directly involved in this study, and potentially beyond by transferring learning to other services. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a mixed-methods study that will collect quantitative and qualitative data using a cross-sectional online survey. Patients who are on waiting lists for elective surgery across four major cardiac surgery departments in London hospitals, and are at least 18 years old, will be invited by their healthcare team via text message or letter to complete the survey. The target sample size of non-randomly selected participants will be 268. Bivariable and multivariable regression models will be used to assess associations between survey items measuring the impact of the cardiac condition on specific life domains (eg, daily activities, social and family relationships, hobbies, sexual life), anxiety and depression symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 and survey items evaluating experiences of health services. Data on experience and preferences for improvements to the waiting experience will be analysed with qualitative content analysis using an inductive approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was reviewed and granted ethical approval by the East of England-East Cambridge Research Ethics Committee. Findings from this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, a research website and social media and with an online event engaging patients, members of the public, healthcare professionals and other relevant stakeholders.

Limited versus full sternotomy for aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve disease is a common condition easily treatable with cardiac surgery. This is conventionally performed by opening the sternum ('median sternotomy') and replacing the valve under cardiopulmonary bypass. Median sternotomy is well tolerated, but as less invasive options become available, the efficacy of limited incisions has been called into question. In particular, the effects of reducing the visibility and surgical access have raised safety concerns with regard to the placement of cannulae, venting of the heart, epicardial wire placement, and de-airing of the heart at the end of the procedure. These difficulties may increase operating times, affecting outcome. The benefits of smaller incisions are thought to include decreased pain; improved respiratory mechanics; reductions in wound infections, bleeding, and need for transfusion; shorter intensive care stay; better cosmesis; and a quicker return to normal activity. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2017, with seven new studies. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement via a limited sternotomy versus conventional aortic valve replacement via median sternotomy in people with aortic valve disease requiring surgical replacement. SEARCH METHODS: We performed searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase from inception to August 2021, with no language limitations. We also searched two clinical trials registries and manufacturers' websites. We reviewed references of primary studies to identify any further studies of relevance. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials comparing aortic valve replacement via a median sternotomy versus aortic valve replacement via a limited sternotomy. We excluded trials that performed other minimally invasive incisions such as mini-thoracotomies, port access, transapical, transfemoral or robotic procedures. Although some well-conducted prospective and retrospective case-control and cohort studies exist, these were not included in this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial papers to extract data, assess quality, and identify risk of bias. A third review author provided arbitration where required. We determined the certainty of evidence using the GRADE methodology and summarised results of patient-relevant outcomes in a summary of findings table. MAIN RESULTS: The review included 14 trials with 1395 participants. Most studies had at least two domains at high risk of bias. We analysed 14 outcomes investigating the effects of minimally invasive limited upper hemi-sternotomy on aortic valve replacement as compared to surgery performed via full median sternotomy. Upper hemi-sternotomy may have little to no effect on mortality versus full median sternotomy (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.94; 10 studies, 985 participants; low-certainty evidence). Upper hemi-sternotomy for aortic valve replacement may increase cardiopulmonary bypass time slightly, although the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference (MD) 10.63 minutes, 95% CI 3.39 to 17.88; 10 studies, 1043 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and may increase aortic cross-clamp time slightly (MD 6.07 minutes, 95% CI 0.79 to 11.35; 12 studies, 1235 participants; very low-certainty evidence), although the evidence is very uncertain. Most studies had at least two domains at high risk of bias. Postoperative blood loss was probably lower in the upper hemi-sternotomy group (MD -153 mL, 95% CI -246 to -60; 8 studies, 767 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence suggested that there may be no change in pain scores by upper hemi-sternotomy (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.19, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.04; 5 studies, 649 participants). Upper hemi-sternotomy may result in little to no difference in quality of life (MD 0.03 higher, 95% CI 0 to 0.06 higher; 4 studies, 624 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two studies reporting index admission costs concluded that limited sternotomy may be more costly at index admission in the UK National Health Service (MD 1190 GBP more, 95% CI 420 GBP to 1970 GBP, 2 studies, 492 participants; low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence was of very low to moderate certainty. Sample sizes were small and underpowered to demonstrate differences in some outcomes. Clinical heterogeneity was also noted. Considering these limitations, there may be little to no effect on mortality. Differences in extracorporeal support times are uncertain, comparing upper hemi-sternotomy to full sternotomy for aortic valve replacement. Before widespread adoption of the minimally invasive approach can be recommended, there is a need for a well-designed and adequately powered prospective randomised controlled trial. Such a study would benefit from also performing a robust cost analysis. Growing patient preference for minimally invasive techniques merits thorough quality of life analyses to be included as end points, as well as quantitative measures of physiological reserve.",0
Defining inappropriate thyroid biopsy?-Proposed definition based on clinical evidence and stakeholder engagement.,"PURPOSE: Identify factors that can be used to assess the appropriateness of a thyroid biopsy and propose a pathway to define inappropriate thyroid biopsies in practice. METHODS: We identified factors utilized in clinical guidelines and existing literature to determine the clinical indications for a thyroid biopsy. Subsequently, we assembled a multidisciplinary panel of experts, including patients, clinicians, researchers, and quality experts, to integrate these factors and develop a pathway for assessing the appropriateness of thyroid biopsies. RESULTS: Through literature review and stakeholder engagement, we identified multiple factors to determine if a thyroid biopsy is necessary: ultrasound risk assessment, presence of compressive symptoms and/or clinical suspicion of high-risk thyroid cancer, life expectancy, comorbidity burden, surgical risk, personal risk factors for thyroid cancer, thyroid function levels, local resources and medical expertise and patient values and preferences. We proposed a multiple-tier classification for the appropriateness of thyroid biopsy that begins with ultrasound findings (e.g., size, thyroid cancer risk) and encompasses the evaluation of additional patient-specific factors. CONCLUSION: Assessment of the appropriateness of a thyroid biopsy is possible. Although, thyroid nodule ultrasound risk assessment is a pivotal factor for this assessment, additional factors should be considered (e.g., life expectancy, personal risk factors for thyroid cancer, patient preferences). Yet, additional efforts are needed to operationalize the objective implementation of these factors in clinical practice.",0
Fracture risk and assessment in adults with cancer.,"Individuals with cancer face unique risk factors for osteoporosis and fractures. Clinicians must consider the additive effects of cancer-specific factors, including treatment-induced bone loss, and premorbid fracture risk, utilizing FRAX score and bone mineral densitometry when available. Pharmacologic therapy should be offered as per cancer-specific guidelines, when available, or local general osteoporosis guidelines informed by clinical judgment and patient preferences. Our objective was to review and summarize the epidemiologic burden of osteoporotic fracture risk and fracture risk assessment in adults with cancer, and recommended treatment thresholds for cancer treatment-induced bone loss, with specific focus on breast, prostate, thyroid, gynecological, multiple myeloma, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This narrative review was informed by PubMed searches to July 25, 2022, that combined terms for cancer, stem cell transplantation, fracture, bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular bone score, FRAX, Garvan nomogram or fracture risk calculator, QFracture, prediction, and risk factors. The literature informs that cancer can impact bone health in numerous ways, leading to both systemic and localized decreases in BMD. Many cancer treatments can have detrimental effects on bone health. In particular, hormone deprivation therapies for hormone-responsive cancers such as breast cancer and prostate cancer, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant for hematologic malignancies, adversely affect bone turnover, resulting in osteoporosis and fractures. Surgical treatments such as hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for gynecological cancers can also lead to deleterious effects on bone health. Radiation therapy is well documented to cause localized bone loss and fractures. Few studies have validated the use of fracture risk prediction tools in the cancer population. Guidelines on cancer-specific treatment thresholds are limited, and major knowledge gaps still exist in fracture risk and fracture risk assessment in patients with cancer. Despite the limitations of current knowledge on fracture risk assessment and treatment thresholds in patients with cancer, clinicians must consider the additive effects of bone damaging factors to which these patients are exposed and their premorbid fracture risk profile. Pharmacologic treatment should be offered as per cancer-specific guidelines when available, or per local general osteoporosis guidelines, in accordance with clinical judgment and patient preferences.",0
When should electronic medical records reminders for cancer screening stop?-Results from a national physician survey.,"BACKGROUND: Many older adults are screened for breast and colorectal cancers beyond guideline recommended thresholds. Electronic medical record (EMR) reminders are commonly used to prompt cancer screening. Behavioral economics theory suggests that changing the default settings for these reminders can be effective to reduce over-screening. We examined physician perspectives about acceptable thresholds for stopping EMR cancer screening reminders. METHODS: In a national survey of 1200 primary care physicians (PCP) and 600 gynecologists randomly selected from the AMA Masterfile, we asked physicians to choose whether EMR reminders for cancer screening should stop based on a list of criteria that included age, life expectancy, specific serious illnesses, and functional limitations. Physicians could choose multiple responses. PCPs were randomized to questions about breast or colorectal cancer screening. RESULTS: A total of 592 physicians participated (adjusted response rate 54.1%). 54.6% chose age and 71.8% chose life expectancy as criteria for stopping EMR reminders; only 30.6% chose functional limitations. Regarding age thresholds, 52.4% chose ages ≤75, 42.0% chose a threshold between 75 and 85, 5.6% would not stop reminders even at age 85. Regarding life expectancy thresholds, 32.0% chose ≥10 years, 53.1% chose a threshold between 5 and 9 years, 14.9% would not stop reminders even when life expectancy is <5 years. CONCLUSIONS: We found that many physicians would continue EMR reminders for cancer screening even in light of older age, limited life expectancy, and functional limitations. This may reflect reluctance to stop cancer screening and/or reluctance to stop EMR reminders so that physicians can retain control to decide for individual patients, for example, to assess patient preference and ability to tolerate treatment. There was consensus for stopping EMR reminders at ages 85+ and <5-year life expectancy. Interventions that seek to reduce over-screening by suppressing EMR reminders may be important for these groups but may have limited physician buy-in outside these thresholds.",0
Identifying Barriers to Post-Acute Care Referral and Characterizing Negative Patient Preferences Among Hospitalized Older Adults Using Natural Language Processing.,"Our objective was to detect common barriers to post-acute care (B2PAC) among hospitalized older adults using natural language processing (NLP) of clinical notes from patients discharged home when a clinical decision support system recommended post-acute care. We annotated B2PAC sentences from discharge planning notes and developed an NLP classifier to identify the highest-value B2PAC class (negative patient preferences). Thirteen machine learning models were compared with Amazon's AutoGluon deep learning model. The study included 594 acute care notes from 100 patient encounters (1156 sentences contained 11 B2PAC) in a large academic health system. The most frequent and modifiable B2PAC class was negative patient preferences (18.3%). The best supervised model was Extreme Gradient Boosting (F1: 0.859), but the deep learning model performed better (F1: 0.916). Alerting clinicians of negative patient preferences early in the hospitalization can prompt interventions such as patient education to ensure patients receive the right level of care and avoid negative outcomes.",0
Editorial Commentary: Suture Button Fixation for the Latarjet Procedure Is Superior to Screw Fixation.,"An increasing body of evidence suggests that suture button fixation is comparable with screw fixation in Latarjet and potentially associated with reduced graft resorption. Suture button fixation may facilitate performing the Latarjet procedure, particularly when done in an arthroscopic manner. The use of suture button fixation technique theoretically facilitates improved positioning of the graft on the glenoid, as it frees the surgeon from the potential of the soft-tissue envelope to impact positioning of the graft, which can occur with screw-based guides. The bone graft can be shuttled into an optimal position and then tensioned with relative ease in comparison with screw-based techniques. Suture button fixation results in lower complication rates compared with screw fixation; almost one third of the screw fixation complications are hardware-related, and screw fixation results in a high rate of hardware removal. Moreover, the arthroscopic Latarjet suture button literature is published by experienced surgeons. Arthroscopic Latarjet has a significant learning curve, reducing the translatability of studies that report superior findings with any one technique. The generalizability of results reminds us that evidence-based medicine should be practiced through the lens of not only patient preferences, but also through an honest appraisal of a surgeon's own ability.",0
Using discrete choice experiment to investigate patients' and parents' preferences for initiating ADHD medication.,"BACKGROUND: The decision to initiate medication is complex and is influenced by a variety of factors. There is limited information on the relative importance of factors that influence the initiation of ADHD medication. AIMS: To investigate the factors, and their relative importance, that influence the decision to initiate medication in adults, and parents of children, with ADHD. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was conducted using eight choice tasks made up of five attributes that described the outcomes of initiating medication. A mixed multinomial logit model was used to estimate preferences for medication. RESULTS: Respondents' overall preferences for initiating medication were negative (Mean (β)= -0.72705, p < 0.1), however, significant heterogeneity was noted in preferences (SD: 0.93604, p < 0.001). Side-effects were the most important factor for both adults (Relative importance (RI) = 40.39%) and parents (RI = 41.99%). Improvement in education had a greater weighting in adults' decision-making compared to parents (RI = 36.93% vs 30.47%) while improvement in aggressive (RI = 14.38% vs 11.84%) and social behaviour (RI = 12.59% vs 10.37%) was more important to parents. CONCLUSIONS: Important differences in preferences of patients and parents were identified, highlighting that the decision to initiate medication is influenced differently in different individuals and groups.",1
Which Factors Are Considered by Patients When Considering Total Joint Arthroplasty? A Discrete-choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: TKA and THA are major surgical procedures, and they are associated with the potential for serious, even life-threatening complications. Patients must weigh the risks of these complications against the benefits of surgery. However, little is known about the relative importance patients place on the potential complications of surgery compared with any potential benefit the procedures may achieve. Furthermore, patient preferences may often be discordant with surgeon preferences regarding the treatment decision-making process. A discrete-choice experiment (DCE) is a quantitative survey technique designed to elicit patient preferences by presenting patients with two or more hypothetical scenarios. Each scenario is composed of several attributes or factors, and the relative extent to which respondents prioritize these attributes can be quantified to assess preferences when making a decision, such as whether to pursue lower extremity arthroplasty. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In this DCE, we asked: (1) Which patient-related factors (such as pain and functional level) and surgery-related factors (such as the risk of infection, revision, or death) are influential in patients' decisions about whether to undergo lower extremity arthroplasty? (2) Which of these factors do patients emphasize the most when making this decision? METHODS: A DCE was designed with the following attributes: pain; physical function; return to work; and infection risks, reoperation, implant failure leading to premature revision, deep vein thrombosis, and mortality. From October 2021 to March 2022, we recruited all new patients to two arthroplasty surgeons' clinics who were older than 18 years and scheduled for a consultation for knee- or hip-related complaints who had no previous history of a primary TKA or THA. A total of 56% (292 of 517) of new patients met the inclusion criteria and were approached with the opportunity to complete the DCE. Among the cohort, 51% (150 of 292) of patients completed the DCE. Patients were administered the DCE, which consisted of 10 hypothetical scenarios that had the patient decide between a surgical and nonsurgical outcome, each consisting of varying levels of eight attributes (such as infection, reoperation, and ability to return to work). A subsequent demographic questionnaire followed this assessment. To answer our first research question about the patient-related and surgery-related factors that most influence patients' decisions to undergo lower extremity arthroplasty, we used a conditional logit regression to control for potentially confounding attributes from within the DCE and determine which variables shifted a patient's determination to pursue surgery. To answer our second question, about which of these factors received the greatest priority by patients, we compared the relevant importance of each factor, as determined by each factor's beta coefficient, against each other influential factor. A larger absolute value of beta coefficient reflects a relatively higher degree of importance placed on a variable compared with other variables within our study. Of the respondents, 57% (85 of 150) were women, and the mean age at the time of participation was 64 ± 10 years. Most respondents (95% [143 of 150]) were White. Regarding surgery, 38% (57 of 150) were considering THA, 59% (88 of 150) were considering TKA, and 3% (5 of 150) were considering both. Among the cohort, 49% (74 of 150) of patients reported their average pain level as severe, or 7 to 10 on a scale from 0 to 10, and 47% (71 of 150) reported having 50% of full physical function. RESULTS: Variables that were influential to respondents when deciding on lower extremity total joint arthroplasty were improvement from severe pain to minimal pain (β coefficient: -0.59 [95% CI -0.72 to -0.46]; p < 0.01), improvement in physical function level from 50% to 100% (β: -0.80 [95% CI -0.9 to -0.7]; p < 0.01), ability to return to work versus inability to return (β: -0.38 [95% CI -0.48 to -0.28]; p < 0.01), and the surgery-related factor of risk of infection (β: -0.22 [95% CI -0.30 to -0.14]; p < 0.01). Improvement in physical function from 50% to 100% was the most important for patients making this decision because it had the largest absolute coefficient value of -0.80. To improve physical function from 50% to 100% and reduce pain from severe to minimal because of total joint arthroplasty, patients were willing to accept a hypothetical absolute (and not merely an incrementally increased) 37% and 27% risk of infection, respectively. When we stratified our analysis by respondents' preoperative pain levels, we identified that only patients with severe pain at the time of their appointment found the risk of infection influential in their decision-making process (β: -0.27 [95% CI -0.37 to -0.17]; p = 0.01) and were willing to accept a 24% risk of infection to improve their physical functioning from 50% to 100%. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that patients consider pain alleviation, physical function improvement, and infection risk to be the most important attributes when considering total joint arthroplasty. Patients with severe baseline pain demonstrated a willingness to take on a hypothetically high infection risk as a tradeoff for improved physical function or pain relief. Because patients seemed to prioritize postoperative physical function so highly in our study, it is especially important that surgeons customize their presentations about the likelihood an individual patient will achieve a substantial functional improvement as part of any office visit where arthroplasty is discussed. Future studies should focus on quantitatively assessing patients' understanding of surgical risks after a surgical consultation, especially in patients who may be the most risk tolerant. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Surgeons should be aware that patients with the most limited physical function and the highest baseline pain levels are more willing to accept the more potentially life-threatening and devastating risks that accompany total joint arthroplasty, specifically infection. The degree to which patients seemed to undervalue the harms of infection (based on our knowledge and perception of those harms) suggests that surgeons need to take particular care in explaining the degree to which a prosthetic joint infection can harm or kill patients who develop one.",1
Barriers and enablers to deprescribing of older adults and their caregivers: a systematic review and meta-synthesis.,"PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to identify the barriers and enablers to deprescribing from the viewpoint of community-dwelling older adults and their caregivers. METHODS: This meta-synthesis included a systematic review of the literature and an inductive thematic synthesis. Medline and EMBASE were searched for studies that qualitatively explored the perspectives of older adults or their caregivers on deprescribing. Studies had to use qualitative methodologies and include community-dwelling adults (or their caregivers) aged 60 years or older who were taking one or more chronic medications. The quality of studies was assessed using the CASP tool. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in the meta-synthesis. All studies included older adults, and 3 included caregivers or companions. Four barriers were identified: favorable perceptions of medications, fear of medication discontinuation, the complexity of the healthcare system and discouragement from healthcare professionals; and seven enablers were identified: medication safety concerns, patient autonomy and confidence, education, follow-up, deprescribing strategies, relationships with physicians, and patient-perceived benefits of deprescribing. CONCLUSION: Multiple barriers and enablers to deprescribing exist within the older adult population. Health system complexity and direct discouragement from healthcare providers were barriers uniquely identified in the older adult population. This population would benefit from interventions to increase their medication literacy, confidence, and autonomy in the deprescribing journey.",0
Challenges of Shared Decision-making by Clinicians and Patients With Low-risk Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Ethnography.,"IMPORTANCE: Several international guidelines have endorsed more conservative treatment of low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (LRDTC), yet patients are facing more treatment options with similar oncologic outcomes and are expressing feelings of confusion, dissatisfaction, and anxiety. Shared decision-making, which considers the patient's values and preferences along with the most reliable medical evidence, has been proposed to optimize patient satisfaction in the context of the current clinical equipoise. OBJECTIVES: To understand key individual and behavioral factors affecting the patient and clinician decision-making process in treatment decision for LRDTC. EVIDENCE REVIEW: This systematic review and meta-ethnography involved a comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and CINAHL databases for qualitative and mixed-method studies on patient and clinician experiences with the decision-making process for LRDTC treatment. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool; meta-ethnography was used for data analysis. Primary and secondary themes of the included studies were extracted, compared, and translated across articles to produce a lines-of-argument synthesis. FINDINGS: Of 1081 publications identified, 12 articles met the inclusion criteria. The qualitative synthesis produced 4 themes: (1) a bimodal distribution of patient preferences for treatment decisions; (2) clinician anxiety affected equipoise and biased their recommendations; (3) clinicians struggled to identify patient concerns and preferences; and (4) the clinician-patient relationship and psychosocial support were key to shared decision-making but were frequently overlooked. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this systematic review and meta-ethnography emphasize the need for better patient-clinician communication, particularly with respect to eliciting patient concerns and preferences. With an ever-increasing pool of thyroid cancer survivors, future efforts should be directed at establishing and evaluating tools that will aid in shared decision-making for treatment of patients with LRDTC.

Clinical decision-making in older patients with cancer: a cross-sectional single-centre study to assess the impact of clinical judgement and patient preferences.,"OBJECTIVE: The heterogeneity in the population of older patients with cancer makes clinical decision-making difficult. We investigated the agreement between the G8 score and clinical judgment in frailty assessments, determined the impact of a life-expectancy calculator, and explored patient and caregiver preferences towards the treatment goal. METHODS: Patients aged ≥75 years in need of new oncological treatment were prospectively enrolled between June 2020 and February 2021. Frailty was estimated by the oncologist and caregiver and compared to the G8 estimation. We examined whether the oncologist changed the fit/frail estimation based on life expectancy calculated using the ePrognosis tool. The main treatment goals, either longevity or quality of life (QoL), from the patient's and caregiver's perspective were noted and compared. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were included in the analysis. Comparison of the oncologist's and the caregiver's frailty estimation with the G8 assessment showed agreement and a Kappa coefficient of 58.3% (0.231) and 60% (0.255), respectively. The ePrognosis score and the odds of change in the frailty estimation by the oncologist showed no correlation. Regarding preferences, 28 (57.1%) and 17 (34.7%) patients and eighteen (47.3%) and seventeen (44.7%) caregivers chose longevity and QoL, respectively. The observed agreement and Kappa coefficient were 78.8% and 0.578. CONCLUSION: Compared to the G8 assessment, frailty was underestimated by both oncologists and caregivers. Most of the patients chose longevity over QoL, and the preferences between the patient and the caregiver matched in the majority of cases.",0
The influence of multidisciplinary team meetings on treatment decisions in advanced bladder cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of specialised genitourinary multidisciplinary team meetings (MDTMs) in decision-making and identify factors that influence the probability of receiving a treatment plan with curative intent for patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data relating to patients with cT2-4aN0/X-1 M0 urothelial cell carcinoma, diagnosed between November 2017 and October 2019, were selected from the nationwide, population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry ('BlaZIB study'). Curative treatment options were defined as radical cystectomy (RC) with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy, chemoradiation or brachytherapy. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between MDTM factors and curative treatment advice and how this advice was followed. RESULTS: Of the 2321 patients, 2048 (88.2%) were discussed in a genitourinary MDTM. Advanced age (>80 years) and poorer World Health Organization performance status (score 1-2 vs 0) were associated with no discussion (P < 0.001). Being discussed was associated with undergoing treatment with curative intent (odds ratio [OR] 3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-4.9), as was the involvement of a RC hospital (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.09-2.65). Involvement of an academic centre was associated with higher rates of bladder-sparing treatment (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.31-3.21). Patient preference was the main reason for non-adherence to treatment advice. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with MIBC, the probability of being discussed in a MDTM was associated with age, performance status and receiving treatment with curative intent, especially if a representative of a RC hospital was present. Future studies should focus on the impact of MDTM advice on survival data.",0
Perspectives of the Friedreich ataxia community on gene therapy clinical trials.,"Gene therapy is a potential treatment for Friedreich ataxia, with multiple programs on the horizon. The purpose of this study was to collect opinions about gene therapy from individuals 14 years or older with Friedreich ataxia or parents/caregivers of Friedreich ataxia patients who were diagnosed as children 17 or younger. Participants were asked to complete a survey after reading brief educational materials regarding gene therapy. Most of the patients captured in this survey have an early-onset (classical) presentation of the disease. Participants expressed urgency in participating in gene therapy clinical trials despite the associated risks. About half of the respondents believed that gene therapy would cease progression or minimize symptoms, whereas nearly one-fourth expected to be cured. The survey also revealed how participants perceive their symptom burden, because a substantial majority reported that balance/walking issues most interfere with their quality of life and would be the symptom they would prioritize treating. Although not statistically significant, more caregivers prioritized treating cardiomyopathy than patients. This study provides valuable information on priorities, beliefs, and expectations regarding gene therapy and serves to guide future gene therapy opinion studies and gene therapy trial design.",0

Patient attitudes and preferences about expanded noninvasive prenatal testing.,"Introduction: Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is typically carried out to screen for common fetal chromosomal anomalies, with the option to screen for a wider range of chromosomal changes (expanded NIPT) becoming increasingly available. However, little is known about pregnant patients' attitudes and preferences regarding expanded NIPT. Methods: To address this gap, we surveyed general-risk patients having first-tier cfDNA screening at a private prenatal clinic on their expectations for expanded NIPT. Patients were asked questions regarding their current pregnancy and previous pregnancy history, their opinions on fetal DNA screenings during pregnancy and incidental findings, information and opinions on financial resources for NIPT, as well as socio-cultural questions to determine patient demographics. Results: Of the 200 survey participants, the majority were educated, self-reported as white, had a higher than average income, and reported no aneuploidy risk factors. When asked what information they would like to receive from cfDNA screening, the vast majority of participants wanted all information available that could have an immediate impact on fetal health (88%) or an immediate impact on infant health from birth (82%). Many participants also wanted information that could have a future impact on the child's health or an immediate or future impact on the pregnant woman's own health. Most participants wanted information about the sex of fetus (86%) and common trisomies (71%), with almost half of participants desiring information about rare autosomal aneuploidies and/or all genetic information that may affect the baby. In addition, participants were found to be comfortable screening for conditions that are well-known, influence care during pregnancy, and are treatable. Finally, while most respondents either had insurance coverage for NIPT or were able to afford NIPT out of pocket, the majority of our participants felt that expanded NIPT should be either free for everyone or for those considered high risk. Discussion: Our findings suggest that with appropriate pre-test counseling, pregnant patients may choose NIPT for an expanding list of conditions.",0
Patient Preferences in the Treatment of Moderate-to-severe Atopic Dermatitis.,"Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease. A variety of systemic treatments are available for patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The efficacy, safety and administration profile of these treatments vary, and determining the optimal treatment strategy may require weighing the benefits and drawbacks of therapies with diverse characteristics. This study used an online discrete choice experiment survey to investigate treatment preferences among adults with atopic dermatitis from Denmark, France, the UK, or Canada. Participants were identified through existing online panels. The survey included questions regarding different treatment attributes, defined based on currently approved treatments for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Treatment preferences were measured as the relative importance of different treatment attributes. A total of 713 respondents met the inclusion criteria and completed the survey. The discrete choice experiment identified a significant preference for avoiding the risk of severe adverse events, and for oral pill every day compared with biweekly injections. The time to full effect was not rated as being important. These findings suggest that patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis prioritize safety as most important, followed by ease of administration in their treatment preferences, while time to full effect and monitoring requirements were the least important attributes.",1
Gene therapy preferences and informed decision-making: Results from a National Hemophilia Foundation Community Voices in research survey.,"INTRODUCTION: To inform education and treatment discussions, it is important to understand how persons with haemophilia prefer to learn about and discuss new therapies and to identify variables that influence decision-making. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate preferences and variables which influence decision-making related to gene therapy and other novel haemophilia therapies. METHODS: An online survey was sent to men with severe haemophilia enrolled in the National Hemophilia Foundation Community Voices in Research online platform for patient-powered research. RESULTS: One hundred four men completed the survey including 33% Hispanics, 96 who had had not gene therapy and 71/96 (74%) who were on prophylaxis. Ninety-five percent were somewhat or very familiar with gene therapy. Men with haemophilia obtain information about new therapies from several sources, most commonly their haemophilia treatment team, patient advocacy groups and self-study. Participants identified safety and efficacy as well as other educational needs to inform decision-making. Of those without prior gene therapy, 73% indicated a high likelihood of considering gene therapy. Hispanic ethnicity and government-issued insurance were associated with a higher likelihood of considering gene therapy as a treatment option. CONCLUSION: Haemophilia Treatment Centers and patient advocacy groups must be able to educate persons with haemophilia about aspects of novel therapies which are important to the individual, especially short- and long-term safety and efficacy. Further research is needed to determine how patient activation and health literacy influence decision-making and how to achieve equitable access and valid informed consent for novel therapies.",0
Visual performance and patient preference with bilateral implantation of an extended depth of focus or combined implantation of an extended depth of focus/trifocal intraocular lens.,"PURPOSE: Evaluate postoperative visual performance in patients with bilaterally implanted AT LARA or AT LARA/AT LISA tri (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany) intraocular lenses. METHODS: Multicentered, comparative, open-label, retrospective/prospective study. Post-IOL implantation, patients were prospectively enrolled into this study; preoperative patient data were collected retrospectively. Follow-up was at 2-4 and 5-8 months post-surgery. The primary endpoint was binocular best corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA). The study was retrospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT05462067). RESULTS: Seventy-one patients (142 eyes) were enrolled; 67 patients (134 eyes) have 5-8 months data. The mean binocular CDVA at 2-4 months was -0.10 ± 0.06 logMAR in the bilateral AT LARA group (""bilateral"") and -0.11 ± 0.09 logMAR in the combined implantation AT LARA/ AT LISA tri group (""combined implantation""); (P = 0.4856). At 5-8 months, mean binocular CDVA was -0.13 ± 0.06 logMAR in the bilateral group and -0.11 ± 0.09 in the combined implantation group (P = 0.4003). At 5-8 months, more eyes in the bilateral group attained 0.2 logMAR or better binocular uncorrected intermediate VA (UIVA; 67 cm) than those in the combined implantation group (100% vs. 94%, respectively). The bilateral group achieved a mean of 0.24 ± 0.11 logMAR in uncorrected near VA (UCNVA), compared to a mean of 0.16 ± 0.12 logMAR in the combined implantation group at 5-8 months (P = 0.0041). CONCLUSIONS: A combined implantation approach (AT LARA in the distance dominant eye/AT LISA tri in the non-dominant eye) produced similar CDVA outcomes but better UCNVA as bilateral implantation with the AT LARA. UIVA was comparable between groups. No new safety concerns were reported.",0
Co-Design of an Evidence-Based Practice Continuing Education Course for Canadian Naturopathic Doctors.,"Objectives: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is a clinical decision-making process combining the best available scientific evidence with clinician expertise and patient preference. While EBP has been associated with a range of benefits, it is recognized that EBP is used suboptimally by a range of health professionals, including naturopathic doctors (NDs). Canadian NDs have expressed a high level of interest in opportunities to improve their EBP skills; however, barriers exist, including those that apply broadly to health professionals, and those that are unique to the naturopathic profession. The objective of the present project was to co-design an EBP continuing education (CE) course tailored to the needs and preferences of Canadian NDs. Design: These needs were solicited through the use of focus groups. Groups were stratified based on participants' use of evidence at baseline. The focus groups asked NDs about their definition of EBP, and their interest in an EBP course, including preferred content, and method of delivery. The focus group discussions were transcribed, and thematic analysis was completed. Subjects: Twenty-two Canadian NDs participated. Results: Participants reported a high level of understanding of EBP, a high level of interest in participating in an EBP course and provided actionable recommendations about course content and delivery. Some of the themes that emerged were consistent across the groups while others differed by stratification. Conclusions: The findings of this project will inform the development and evaluation of a future CE course.",0
Patient perceptions of in-hospital laboratory blood testing: A patient-oriented and patient co-designed qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Indiscriminate use of laboratory blood testing in hospitals contributes to patient discomfort and healthcare waste. Patient engagement in low-value healthcare can help reduce overuse. Understanding patient experience is necessary to identify opportunities to improve patient engagement with in-hospital laboratory testing. OBJECTIVES: To understand patient experience with the process of in-hospital laboratory blood testing. METHODS: We used a qualitative study design via semistructured interviews conducted online or over the phone. Participants were adult patients or family members/caregivers (≥18 years of age) with a recent (within 12 months of interview) experience of hospitalization in Alberta or British Columbia, Canada. We identified participants through convenience sampling and conducted interviews between May 2021 and June 2022. We analysed transcripts using thematic content analysis. Recruitment was continued until code saturation was reached. RESULTS: We interviewed 16 participants (13 patients, 1 family member and 2 caregivers). We identified four themes from patients' experiences of in-hospital laboratory blood testing: (i) patients need information from healthcare teams about expected blood testing processes, (ii) blood draw processes should consider patient comfort and preferences, (iii) patients want information from their healthcare teams about the rationale and frequency of blood testing and (iv) patients need information on how their testing results affect their medical care. CONCLUSION: Current laboratory testing processes in hospitals do not facilitate shared decision-making and patient engagement. Patient engagement with laboratory testing in hospitals requires an empathetic healthcare team that provides clear communication regarding testing procedures, rationale and results, while considering patient preferences and offering opportunities for involvement. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: We interviewed 16 patients and/or family members/caregivers regarding their in-hospital laboratory blood testing experiences. Our findings show correlations between patient needs and patient recommendations to make testing processes more patient-centred. To bring a lived-experience lens to this study, we formed a Patient Advisory Council with 9-11 patient research partners. Our patient research partners informed the research design, co-developed participant recruitment strategies, co-conducted data collection and informed the data analysis. Some of our patient research partners are co-authors of this manuscript.",0
Turning It Over to God: African American Assisted Living Residents' End-of-Life Preferences and Advance Care Planning.,"OBJECTIVES: Assisted living (AL), a popular long-term care setting for older Americans, increasingly is a site for end-of-life care. Although most residents prefer AL to be their final home, relatively little is known about end-of-life preferences and advance care planning, especially among African American residents. Our research addresses this knowledge gap. METHODS: Informed by grounded theory, we present an analysis of qualitative data collected over 2 years in a 100-bed AL community catering to African American residents. Data consisted of field notes from participant observation conducted during 310 site visits and 818 observation hours, in-depth interviews with 25 residents, and a review of their AL records. RESULTS: Residents varied in their end-of-life preferences and advance care planning, but united in the belief that God was in control. We identified ""Turning it over to God"" as an explanatory framework for understanding how this group negotiated end-of-life preferences and advance care planning. Individual-level resident factors (e.g., age, pain, and function) and factors reflecting broader cultural and societal influences, including health literacy and care experiences, were influential. DISCUSSION: Contradictions arose from turning it over to God, including those between care preferences, planning, and anticipated or actual end-of-life outcomes.",0
Patient Preferences for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treatments: A Discrete-Choice Experiment.,"Treatments for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have varying benefit-risk profiles. We elicited 200 US patients' preferences for attributes associated with various first-line systemic treatments for unresectable HCC in a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey. Respondents answered nine DCE questions, each offering a choice between two hypothetical treatment profiles defined by six attributes with varying levels: overall survival (OS), months of maintained daily function, severity of palmar-plantar syndrome, severity of hypertension, risk of digestive-tract bleeding, and mode and frequency of administration. A random-parameters logit model was used to analyze the preference data. Patients regarded an additional 10 months of maintaining daily function without decline to be as important or more important than 10 additional months of OS, on average. Respondents valued avoiding moderate-to-severe palmar-plantar syndrome and hypertension more than extended OS. A respondent would require >10 additional months of OS (the greatest increase presented in the study) on average to offset the increased burden of adverse events. Patients with unresectable HCC prioritize avoiding adverse events that would severely impact their quality of life over mode and frequency of administration or digestive-tract bleeding risk. For some patients with unresectable HCC, maintaining daily functioning is as important or more important than the survival benefit of a treatment.",1
Colorectal Cancer Screening in the Elderly: Does Increased Prevalence Necessitate Tighter Surveillance.,"BACKGROUND: With age, colorectal cancer (CRC) prevalence rises. The elderly (> 75 years), and the very elderly (> 85 years) are especially vulnerable. The advantages of screening must be assessed in the context of diminished life span and co-morbidities. OBJECTIVES: To compare CRC findings in colonoscopies that were performed following a positive fecal occult blood test/fecal immunochemical test (FOBT/FIT) in both elderly and very elderly age groups with those of younger patients. METHODS: We identified colonoscopies conducted between 1998 and 2019 following a positive stool test for occult blood in asymptomatic individuals. A finding of malignancy was compared between the two patient age groups. Furthermore, a sub-analysis was performed for positive malignancy findings in FOBT/FIT among patients > 85 years compared to younger than < 75 years. RESULTS: We compared the colonoscopy findings in 10,472 patients: 40-75 years old (n=10,146) vs. 76-110 years old (n=326). There was no significant difference in prevalence of CRC detection rate between the groups following positive FOBT/FIT (2.1% vs. 2.7%, P = 0.47). Similar results for non-significant differences were obtained in the sub-analysis compared to malignancy detection rates in the very elderly 0% (n=0) vs. 2.1% for < 75 years old (n=18), P = 0.59. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of CRC increases with age, no significant increase in the detection rate of CRC by FOBT was found in either the elderly or very elderly age groups. Screening colonoscopies in elderly patients should be performed only after careful consideration of potential benefits, risks, and patient preferences.",0
"Impact of Race, Ethnicity, Primary Language, and Insurance on Reconstruction after Mastectomy for Patients with Breast Cancer at an Urban, Academic Safety-Net Hospital.","BACKGROUND: Disparities in breast reconstruction have been observed in national cohorts and single-institution studies based on race, ethnicity, insurance, and language. However, little is known regarding whether safety-net hospitals deliver more or less equitable breast reconstruction care in comparison with national cohorts. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective study of patients with either invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosed and treated at our institution (January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014). The rate of, timing of, and approach to breast reconstruction were assessed by race, ethnicity, insurance status, and primary language among women who underwent mastectomy. Reasons for not performing reconstruction were also analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 756 women with ductal carcinoma in situ or nonmetastatic invasive cancer were identified. The median age was 58.5 years, 56.2% were non-White, 33.1% were non-English-speaking, and 48.9% were Medicaid/uninsured patients. A total of 142 (18.8%) underwent mastectomy during their index operation. A total of 47.9% (n = 68) did not complete reconstruction. Reasons for not performing reconstruction included patient preference (n = 22), contraindication to immediate reconstruction (ie, locoregionally advanced disease prohibiting immediate reconstruction) without follow-up for consideration of delayed reconstruction (n = 12), prohibitive medical risk or contraindication (ie, morbid obesity; n = 8), and progression of disease, prohibiting reconstruction (n = 7). Immediate and delayed reconstruction were completed in 43.7% and 8.5% of patients. The rate of reconstruction was inversely associated with tumor stage (odds ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.88), but not race, ethnicity, insurance, or language, on multivariate regression. CONCLUSIONS: At a safety-net hospital, we observed rates of reconstruction at or greater than national estimates. After adjustment for clinical attributes, rates did not vary by race, ethnicity, insurance or language. Future research is needed to understand the role of reconstruction in breast cancer care and how to advance shared decision-making among diverse patients.",0
"Atrial fibrillation, cancer and anticancer drugs.","Active cancer is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), which varies depending on the pre-existing substrate (particularly in older patients), the cancer type and stage, and the anticancer therapeutics being taken. To date, studies have not been able to identify the individual contribution of each factor. During anticancer drug therapy, AF may occur with a frequency of ≈ 15-20% according to several factors, including the patient's baseline cardiovascular toxicity risk and the AF-detection strategies used. Many anticancer drugs have been associated with AF or AF reporting, both in terms of incident and recurrent AF, but robust data are lacking. Only bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor associated AF (mainly ibrutinib) has a high level of evidence, with a ≈ 3-4-fold higher risk of AF. AF in patients with active cancer is associated with a twofold higher risk of systemic thromboembolism or stroke, and the ""TBIP"" (Thromboembolic risk, Bleeding risk, drug-drug Interactions, Patient preferences) structured approach must be used to evaluate the need for anticoagulation therapy. AF in patients with active cancer is also associated with a sixfold higher risk of heart failure, and optimal symptom control must be targeted, usually with rate-control drugs (beta-blockers), but a rhythm-control strategy may be proposed in patients remaining symptomatic despite optimal rate-control. AF is generally manageable, with the continuation of anticancer drugs (including ibrutinib); interruption of cancer drugs must be avoided whenever possible and weighed against the risk of cancer progression.",0
Effect of switching from continuous to bilevel positive airway pressure on sleep quality in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: the prospective POP IN VAuto study.,"BACKGROUND: Issues with tolerability and side effects can decrease continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device usage and the benefits of therapy. Different positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy modes providing expiratory pressure relief or using a different pressure during inspiration vs. expiration (bilevel PAP) may alleviate some of these issues. This multicenter, prospective study evaluated the effects of switching from CPAP to bilevel PAP (VAuto mode) on respiratory parameters, device usage, side effects and patient-reported outcomes in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). METHODS: Eligible OSA patients had started CPAP ≥3 months previously, had good compliance (mean 6.1±2.0 h/night) and well-controlled OSA [residual apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 4.9±3.1/h] but had pressure tolerance issues or persistent side effects/discomfort. All were switched from CPAP to bilevel PAP (AirCurve 10 VAuto; ResMed). Effectiveness (residual AHI), sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, therapy-related side effects, and patient satisfaction/preference were assessed after 3 months and 1 year. RESULTS: Forty patients were analyzed (68% male, age 64±11 years, body mass index 30.7±5.8 kg/m(2)). At 3 months and 1 year after switching to bilevel PAP, median [interquartile range] residual AHI was 4/h [2-5.3] and 3.7/h [1.8-5], respectively, and device usage was 7.0 [4.9-7.5] and 6.4 [4.4-7.3] h/night, respectively. Device switch was associated with significant reductions from baseline in expiratory PAP {from 12 [11-13] to 8 [7-9] cmH(2)O at 3 months (P<0.001) and 9 [8-12] cmH(2)O at 1 year (P=0.005)}, 95(th) percentile pressure {from 14 [12-14] to 10 [9-11] and 10 [8-11] cmH2O; P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively} and leak {from 1 [0-6] to 0 [0-1] and 0 [0-2] L/min; P=0.049 and P=0.033, respectively}. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score decreased significantly from baseline to 3 and 6 months [7.2±4.0 to 5.0±3.2 (P=0.005) and 4.5±2.7 (P<0.001), respectively]. CPAP-related mouth dryness, choking sensation and aerophagia were significantly improved one year after switching to bilevel PAP. Bilevel PAP was preferred over CPAP by 90% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Switching to bilevel PAP had several benefits in patients struggling with CPAP, facilitating therapy acceptance and ongoing device usage.",0
The role of the foam formulation in improving psoriasis treatment acceptability: a real-life experience and a literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Topical therapies represent the first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Among various topical options, the fixed-dose combination of calcipotriene (Cal) and betamethasone dipropionate (BD) foam (Enstilar®, LEO Pharma, Ballerup, Denmark) showed superior efficacy to Cal and BD monotherapy and ointment and gel formulations. In addition, the Cal/BD foam is the only topical treatment allowed for either reactive treatment of relapse or twice-weekly maintenance use. Since treatment acceptability is crucial to optimize adherence, this paper presents a case series from a multicenter experience using the Cal/BD foam, to further characterize the use of this therapeutic approach. In addition, a narrative review of studies evaluating the acceptability of the Cal/BD foam, even compared with other formulations, is provided. CASE SERIES: The case series involved adult patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis treated with the Cal/BD foam from October 2021 to June 2022. A clinical and dermoscopic evaluation of plaques was provided for all patients. Data from the clinical practice report complete clinical resolution of plaques in most patients after 4 weeks of active treatment with the Cal/BD foam, and the dermoscopic clearance after a maximum of 8 weeks. Full adherence to treatment was also reported. Literature evidence suggests that the Cal/BD foam is easy to apply and presents high cosmetic acceptance, rapid onset of action, high efficacy, optimal safety, and a high patient preference. The high satisfaction obtained with Cal/BD foam suggests that this formulation is better accepted than others. CONCLUSIONS: The Cal/BD foam represents a valuable approach for managing mild-to-moderate psoriasis, both in short and long-term treatment.",0
Adjuvant treatment decisions among adults aged 65 years and older with early-stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer seen in a simple multidisciplinary clinic versus standard consultation.,"INTRODUCTION: Randomized studies support de-escalation of adjuvant therapy for a target population of older adults ≥65 years with stage I, estrogen-receptor (ER) positive breast cancer after breast conserving surgery. We sought to evaluate the impact of a simplified multidisciplinary clinic (s-MDC) in this population by comparing treatment patterns and patient perceptions of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and hormone therapy (HT) between patients seen in s-MDC vs. standard consultations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for patients in the above target population who underwent surgery between August 2020 and May 2022 at our institution. Two cohorts were included: (1) patients seen in s-MDC, and (2) patients seen in standard clinic separately by medical and radiation oncology (non-s-MDC cohort). The non-s-MDC patients declined, could not attend, and/or were not referred to the s-MDC. Patients in the s-MDC cohort were prospectively administered validated questionnaires to evaluate patient reported data including the Decision Autonomy Preference Scale (DAPS), e-Prognosis, and Medical Maximizing-Minimizing Scale (MMS). Chi square, t-tests, and non-parametric equivalents compared demographics, and logistic regression evaluated RT and HT use and survey score outcomes between cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 127 patients met inclusion criteria, with 33 s-MDC and 94 non-s-MDC patients. There was no difference between the cohorts in age, margin status, histology, grade, or focality. In the s-MDC cohort there were significantly more patients without sentinel lymph node biopsy (71.3% vs 42.4%, p = 0.003) and mean tumor size was smaller (0.69 vs. 0.96 cm, p < 0.003), and Charlson comborbidity index (CCI) was higher (5.21 vs 4.96, p = 0.038). There was no significant difference in receipt of RT (65% s-MDC vs 77% standard; odds ratio [OR] = 0.55, p = 0.189), HT (78% ss-MDC vs 72% standard; OR = 1.36, p = 0.513), or both (50% s-MDC vs 59% standard; OR = 0.7, p = 0.429). The s-MDC cohort was significantly more likely to undergo accelerated (vs. standard hypofractionated) RT (70% vs 39%; OR = 3.59, p = 0.020). In s-MDC patients with completed questionnaires (n = 33), all whose selected ""mostly patient (n=6)"" based decision making by DAPS chose RT while all ""mostly doctor (n=1)"" chose no RT. Based on e-Prognosis, there were lower odds of RT for increasing Schonberg score/ higher 10 yr mortality risk (OR 0.600, p = 0.048). MMS score ≥ 40 (""maximizer"") was strongly linked with the use of RT (OR 18.57, p = 0.011). DISCUSSION: For adults ≥65 years with early stage, ER positive breast cancer, s-MDC participation was not significantly associated with lower use of adjuvant RT or HT versus standard consultation but was significantly associated with shorter RT courses. DAPS and MMS results indicate that patient treatment preference may be predictable, highlighting an opportunity to tailor consultation discussions and recommendations based on intrinsic patient preferences and individual goals.",0
Telehealth Complementary and Integrative Health Therapies During COVID-19 at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.,"Background: Complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies, such as in-person acupuncture, chiropractic care, and meditation, are evidence-based nonpharmaceutical treatment options for pain. During COVID-19, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) delivered several CIH therapies virtually. This study explores veterans' utilization, advantages/disadvantages, and delivery issues of yoga, Tai Chi, meditation/mindfulness (self-care), and massage, chiropractic, and acupuncture (practitioner-delivered care), using telephone/video at 18 VA sites during COVID-19. Methods: Use of virtual care was examined quantitatively with VA administrative data for six CIH therapies before and after COVID-19 onset (2019-2021). Advantages/disadvantages and health care delivery issues of these CIH therapies through virtual care were examined qualitatively using interview data (2020-2021). Results: Overall, televisits represented a substantial portion of all CIH self-care therapies delivered by VA in 2020 (53.7%) and 2021 (82.1%), as sites developed virtual group classes using VA secure online video platforms in response to COVID-19. In contrast, a small proportion of all encounters with acupuncturists, chiropractors, and massage therapists was telephone/video encounters in 2020 (17.3%) and in 2021 (5.4%). These were predominantly one-on-one care in the form of education, follow-ups, home exercises, assessments/evaluations, or acupressure. Delivery issues included technical difficulties, lack of access to needed technology, difficulty tracking virtual visits, and capacity restrictions. Advantages included increased access to self-care, increased patient receptivity to engaging in self-care, and flexibility in staffing online group classes. Disadvantages included patient preference, patient safety, and strain on staffing. Conclusion: Despite delivery issues or disadvantages of tele-CIH self-care, veterans' use of teleself-care CIH therapies grew substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
[Application and Development of a Chinese Medicine Meridian and Acupoint Intervention in Nursing Practice].,"Chinese medicine advocates a holistic and comprehensive approach that emphasizes differential diagnosis, treatment, and nursing as well as a diverse range of healthcare options. Within Chinese medicine, acupuncture techniques targeting meridians and acupoints are recognized as a suitable healthcare modality for promoting health, preventing diseases, and managing existing conditions. This article was designed to explore the practical application and advancement of acupuncture related to meridians and acupoints in the field of nursing. After introducing the development and current landscape of Chinese medicine healthcare, the application of acupoint stimulation within the context of Chinese medicinal nursing is discussed, taking into account clinical expertise, patient preferences, and safety concerns. Next, empirical findings on the impact of acupoint stimulation interventions are presented in hopes of translating clinical knowledge into evidence-based practice. Lastly, future prospects and investments in Chinese medicinal nursing are outlined. Within the realm of professional nursing practice, attaining proficiency in meridian and acupoint interventions requires comprehensive expertise and skills. Healthcare professionals in the nursing field should contemplate enhancing their knowledge and competencies in Chinese medicinal nursing. By providing the best evidence-based care, possessing specialized expertise, and taking patient preferences into account, the quality and completeness of evidence-based healthcare may be improved.",0
Patient's preference for sacrospinous hysteropexy or modified Manchester operation: A discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate women's preference for modified Manchester (MM) or sacrospinous hysteropexy (SH) as surgery for uterine prolapse. DESIGN: Labelled discrete choice experiment (DCE). SETTING: Eight Dutch hospitals. POPULATION: Women with uterine prolapse, eligible for primary surgery and preference for uterus preservation. METHODS: DCEs are attribute-based surveys. The two treatment options were labelled as MM and SH. Attributes in this survey were treatment success ( levels SH: 84%, 89%, 94%; levels MM: 89%, 93%, 96%), dyspareunia (levels: 0%, 5%, 10%), cervical stenosis (levels: 1%, 6%, 11%) and severe buttock pain (levels: 0%, 1%). A different combination of attribute levels was used in each choice set. Women completed nine choice sets, making a choice based on attribute levels. Data were analysed in multinomial logit models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women's preference for MM or SH. RESULTS: 137 DCEs were completed (1233 choice sets). SH was chosen in 49% of the choice sets, MM in 51%. Of all women, 39 (28%) always chose the same surgery. After exclusion of this group, 882 choice sets were analysed, in which women preferred MM, likely associated with a labelling effect, i.e. description of the procedure, rather than the tested attributes. In that group, MM was chosen in 53% of the choice sets and SH in 47%. When choosing MM, next to the label, dyspareunia was relevant for decision-making. For SH, all attributes were relevant for decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: The preference of women for MM or SH seems almost equally divided. The variety in preference supports the importance of individualised healthcare.",1
Racial disparities in the pharmacological treatment of insomnia: A time-to-event analysis using real-world data.,"OBJECTIVE: Examine the association between race and time to pharmacologic treatment of insomnia in a large multi-institutional cohort. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of electronic medical records from a regional health information exchange. Eligible patients included adults with at least one healthcare visit per year from 2010 to 2019, a new insomnia diagnosis code during the study period, and no prior insomnia diagnosis codes or medications. A Cox frailty model was used to examine the association between race and time to an insomnia medication after diagnosis. RESULTS: In total, 9557 patients were analyzed, 7773 (81.3%) of whom where White, 1294 (13.5%) Black, 238 (2.5%) Other, and 252 (2.6%) unknown race. About 6.2% of Black and 8% of Other race patients received an order for a Food and Drug Administration-approved insomnia medication after diagnosis compared with 13.5% of White patients. Black patients were significantly less likely to have an order for a Food and Drug Administration-approved insomnia medication at all time points (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] range: 0.37-0.73), and patients reporting Other race were less likely to have received an order at 2 (aHR 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.94), 3 (aHR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13-0.79), and 4 years (aHR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.71) of follow-up. Similar results were observed in a sensitivity analysis including off-label medications. CONCLUSIONS: Patients belonging to racial minority groups are less likely to be prescribed an insomnia medication than White patients after accounting for sociodemographic and clinical factors. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which patient preferences and physician perceptions affect these prescribing patterns and investigate potential disparities in nonpharmacologic treatment.",0
The Experiences of Older Adults Living With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Scoping Review.,"The prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease is rising in persons older than 65 years. Although there is extensive literature on inflammatory bowel disease in older adults from a disease-related outcome, epidemiological, and treatment perspective, the older adult perspective on inflammatory bowel disease-related care needs and experiences is not well represented. This scoping review examines the existing literature regarding the care experiences of older adults living with inflammatory bowel disease. A systematic search was conducted using 3 concepts: older adults, inflammatory bowel disease, and patient experience. Seven publications met the inclusion criteria. Reported data include study design and methods, sample characteristics, and findings relevant to the research question. Two themes were identified: preferences for interactions with healthcare personnel and peer support networks, and barriers to accessing care for inflammatory bowel disease needs. An overarching concept across all studies was the need and request for individualized, patient-centered care where patient preferences are considered. This review highlights the need for more research on the older adult age group to guide evidence-informed practice that meets their individual inflammatory bowel disease care needs.",0
How can patient preferences be used and communicated in the regulatory evaluation of medicinal products? Findings and recommendations from IMI PREFER and call to action.,"Objective: Patients have unique insights and are (in-)directly affected by each decision taken throughout the life cycle of medicinal products. Patient preference studies (PPS) assess what matters most to patients, how much, and what trade-offs patients are willing to make. IMI PREFER was a six-year European public-private partnership under the Innovative Medicines Initiative that developed recommendations on how to assess and use PPS in medical product decision-making, including in the regulatory evaluation of medicinal products. This paper aims to summarize findings and recommendations from IMI PREFER regarding i) PPS applications in regulatory evaluation, ii) when and how to consult with regulators on PPS, iii) how to reflect PPS in regulatory communication and iv) barriers and open questions for PPS in regulatory decision-making. Methods: PREFER performed six literature reviews, 143 interviews and eight focus group discussions with regulators, patient representatives, industry representatives, Health Technology Assessment bodies, payers, academics, and clincians between October 2016 and May 2022. Results: i) With respect to PPS applications, prior to the conduct of clinical trials of medicinal products, PPS could inform regulators' understanding of patients' unmet needs and relevant endpoints during horizon scanning activities and scientific advice. During the evaluation of a marketing authorization application, PPS could inform: a) the assessment of whether a product meets an unmet need, b) whether patient-relevant clinical trial endpoints and outcomes were studied, c) the understanding of patient-relevant effect sizes and acceptable trade-offs, and d) the identification of key (un-)favorable effects and uncertainties. ii) With respect to consulting with regulators on PPS, PPS researchers should ideally have early discussions with regulators (e.g., during scientific advice) on the PPS design and research questions. iii) Regarding external PPS communication, PPS could be reflected in the assessment report and product information (e.g., the European Public Assessment Report and the Summary of Product Characteristics). iv) Barriers relevant to the use of PPS in regulatory evaluation include a lack of PPS use cases and demonstrated impact on regulatory decision-making, and need for (financial) incentives, guidance and quality criteria for implementing PPS results in regulatory decision-making. Open questions concerning regulatory PPS use include: a) should a product independent broad approach to the design of PPS be taken and/or a product-specific one, b) who should optimally be financing, designing, conducting, and coordinating PPS, c) when (within and/or outside clinical trials) to perform PPS, and d) how can PPS use best be operationalized in regulatory decisions. Conclusion: PPS have high potential to inform regulators on key unmet needs, endpoints, benefits, and risks that matter most to patients and their acceptable trade-offs. Regulatory guidelines, templates and checklists, together with incentives are needed to foster structural and transparent PPS submission and evaluation in regulatory decision-making. More PPS case studies should be conducted and submitted for regulatory assessment to enable regulatory discussion and increase regulators' experience with PPS implementation and communication in regulatory evaluations.",1
Intersectional race and gender disparities in kidney transplant access in the United States: a scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Gender and racial disparities in kidney transplant access are well established, however how gender and race interact to shape access to kidney transplant is less clear. Therefore, we examined existing literature to assess what is known about the potential interaction of gender and race and the impact on access to kidney transplantation in the US. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a scoping review and included quantitative and qualitative studies published in English between 1990 and May 31, 2023 among adult end-stage kidney disease patients in the US. All studies reported on access to specific transplant steps or perceived barriers to transplant access in gender and race subgroups, and the intersection between the two. We narratively synthesized findings across studies. RESULTS: Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria and included outcomes of referral (n = 4, 29%), evaluation (n = 2, 14%), waitlisting (n = 4, 29%), transplantation (n = 5, 36%), provider perceptions of patient transplant candidacy (n = 3, 21%), and patient preferences and requests for a living donor (n = 5, 36%). Overall, we found that White men have the greatest access at all steps of the transplant process, from referral to eventual living or deceased donor transplantation. In contrast, women from racial or ethnic minorities tend to have the lowest access to kidney transplant, in particular living donor transplant, though this was not consistent across all studies. CONCLUSIONS: Examining how racism and sexism interact to shape kidney transplant access should be investigated in future research, in order to ultimately shape policies and interventions to improve equity.",0
Treatment of Granulomatous Inflammation in Pulmonary Sarcoidosis.,"The management of pulmonary sarcoidosis is a complex interplay of disease characteristics, the impact of medications, and patient preferences. Foremost, it is important to weigh the risk of anti-granulomatous treatment with the benefits of lung preservation and improvement in quality of life. Because of its high spontaneous resolution rate, pulmonary sarcoidosis should only be treated in cases of significant symptoms due to granulomatous inflammation, lung function decline, or substantial inflammation on imaging that can lead to irreversible fibrosis. The longstanding basis of treatment has historically been corticosteroid therapy for the control of granulomatous inflammation. However, several corticosteroid-sparing options have increasing evidence for use in refractory disease, inability to taper steroids to an acceptable dose, or in those with toxicity to corticosteroids. Treatment of sarcoidosis should be individualized for each patient due to the heterogeneity of the clinical course, comorbid conditions, response to therapy, and tolerance of medication side effects.",0

"Discrepancy in responses to the surprise question between hemodialysis nurses and physicians, with focus on patient clinical characteristics: A comparative study.","INTRODUCTION: The surprise question (SQ) ""Would I be surprised if this patient died within the next xx months"" can be used by different professions to foresee the need of serious illness conversations in patients approaching end of life. However, little is known about the different perspectives of nurses and physicians in responses to the SQ and factors influencing their appraisals. The aim was to explore nurses' and physicians' responses to the SQ regarding patients on hemodialysis, and to investigate how these answers were associated with patient clinical characteristics. METHODS: This comparative cross-sectional study included 361 patients for whom 112 nurses and 15 physicians responded to the SQ regarding 6 and 12 months. Patient characteristics, performance status, and comorbidities were obtained. Cohen's kappa was used to analyze the interrater agreement between nurses and physicians in their responses to the SQ and multivariable logistic regression was applied to reveal the independent association to patient clinical characteristics. FINDINGS: Proportions of nurses and physicians responding to the SQ with ""no, not surprised"" was similar regarding 6 and 12 months. However, there was a substantial difference concerning which specific patient the nurses and physicians responded ""no, not surprised"", within 6 (κ = 0.366, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.288-0.474) and 12 months (κ = 0.379, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.281-0.477). There were also differences in the patient clinical characteristics associated with nurses' and physicians' responses to the SQ. DISCUSSION: Nurses and physicians have different perspectives in their appraisal when responding to the SQ for patients on hemodialysis. This may reinforce the need for communication and discussion between nurses and physicians to identify the need of serious illness conversations in patients approaching the end of life, in order to adapt hemodialysis care to patient preferences and needs.",0
"Integrating herbal medicine into oncology care delivery: development, implementation, and evaluation of a novel program.","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of a novel program facilitating patient-provider communication about appropriate use of herbal medicine at a large academic cancer center and its impact on patient wellbeing. METHODS: In the Herbal Oncology Program (HOP), integrative medicine providers counseled patients about unmet symptom needs and prescribed traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbs when indicated, taking into consideration the clinical context, patient preference, and research evidence. To evaluate the feasibility and outcomes, we performed a retrospective analysis using medical record data (symptoms and other concerns that motivated patients to seek herbal products, types and numbers of dispensed TCM herbs, and demographic characteristics). We also conducted a survey to assess patient experience and satisfaction. RESULTS: All 851 participants were outpatients, with 712 (84%) in active treatment. HOP dispensed 1266 herbal prescriptions for a range of symptoms, most commonly GI symptoms (467, 37%); pain (353, 28%); and treatment-related fatigue, sleep, and mood disorders (346, 27%). Of 269 patients invited to the survey, 107 (40%) completed it. A majority of respondents 70.9% (73/103) were satisfied with the effectiveness of dispensed herbs in relieving their symptoms, and few 6.7% (7/104) had experienced mild adverse events that resolved after discontinuing herbal use. CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings support the feasibility of integrating herbal medicine into an academic oncology setting. Patient satisfaction with HOP was high, with limited adverse events. The patterns of herbal prescriptions in HOP suggest future areas for clinical research to strengthen the evidence base around safe and effective use.",0
When to Consider Coronary Revascularization for Stable Coronary Artery Disease.,"Revascularization is an effective adjunct to medical therapy for some patients with chronic coronary disease. Despite numerous randomized trials, there remains significant uncertainty regarding if and how to revascularize many patients. Coronary artery bypass grafting is a class I indication for patients with significant left main stenosis or multivessel disease with ejection fraction ≤ 35%. For other patients, clinicians must carefully consider the potential benefits of symptom improvement and reduction of future myocardial infarction or CV death against the risk and cost of revascularization. Although guidelines provide a framework for these decisions, each individual patient will have distinct coronary anatomy, clinical factors, and preferences.",0
The Impact of Video-Based Educational Materials with Voiceovers on Preferences for Glucose Monitoring Technology in Patients with Diabetes: A Randomised Study.,"INTRODUCTION: Ensuring patients have enough information about healthcare choices prior to completing a preference study is necessary to support the validity of the findings. Patients are commonly informed using text-based information with supporting graphics. Video-based information may be more engaging for the general patient population. This study aimed to assess (1) the impact that educating patients using video-based educational materials with a voiceover has on patient preferences compared to traditional text, and (2) whether this impact is consistent between two countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A video-based educational tool was developed to inform patients prior to completing a discrete choice experiment assessing preferences for glucose monitors. Patients with diabetes from the Netherlands and Poland were recruited through an online research panel. Respondents were randomised to receive information in either a text or a video with animations and a voiceover. Data were analysed using a mixed-logit model. RESULTS: N = 981 completed surveys were analysed from the Netherlands (n = 459) and Poland (n = 522). Differences were found between the countries, but no interpretable pattern of differences was found between the two types of educational materials. Patients spent less time in the educational material than would be necessary to fully review all of the content. CONCLUSIONS: Simply providing educational material in a video with animations and voiceovers does not necessarily lead to better engagement from respondents or different preference outcomes in a sample of diabetes patients when compared to text. Increasing engagement with educational materials should be a topic of future research for those conducting patient preference research as no amount of educational material will be helpful if respondents do not access it.",1
Patient preferences for the treatment of chronic cough: a discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic cough is common, negatively affects quality of life and has limited treatment options. Inhibition of purinergic signalling is a promising therapeutic approach but is associated with taste-related adverse effects. Little is known about treatment preferences from the perspective of patients with chronic cough, such as trade-offs between efficacy and side effect. METHODS: Patients with chronic cough completed an online discrete choice experiment survey in which they answered a series of questions requiring a choice between two constructed treatment options characterised by varying attribute levels. Selection of cough and taste-related attributes was informed by qualitative interviews and clinical trial data. Logit-based models were used to analyse resulting choice data. RESULTS: The discrete choice experiment survey was completed by 472 participants with chronic cough. Among study attributes, frequency of intense cough attacks was the most important to participants, followed by taste change, frequency of night-time coughing and frequency of daytime coughing. To accept the least preferred taste disturbance of a bitter, metallic, chalky or oily taste change, participants required either: (1) elimination of night-time cough along with a slight reduction in daytime cough; (2) elimination of daytime cough along with a pronounced reduction in night-time or (3) reduction in intense cough attacks from 7 to 2 times per week. Two distinct preference patterns were identified, each placing different importance on efficacy versus side effect trade-offs. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with chronic cough were willing to accept some taste disturbances in exchange for improved efficacy of chronic cough treatments. Knowledge of patient preferences can facilitate shared decision-making.",1
Effective Use of Bromelain and Acetylcysteine (BromAc(®)) for Treatment of Perigastric Pseudomyxoma Peritonei: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare clinical condition of progressive peritoneal mucin accumulation. PMP has a reasonable survivability but with a notable risk of tumour recurrence. Standard treatment, including for tumour relapse, aims for a cure with complete cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. In the case of tumour recurrence, surgery becomes progressively complex, and some patients are not suitable for surgery either due to patient preference or morbidity and mortality risk. BromAc(®) is an emerging, novel mucolytic combination therapy composed of bromelain and acetylcysteine which can be administered intratumorally via radiologically guided drains. It represents a minimally invasive treatment for patients who have symptomatic tumour deposits but are not surgical candidates. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 64-year-old male with a background of appendiceal PMP who presented with a gastric outlet obstruction from a perigastric tumour deposit. This was managed with BromAc(®) administration, following which the patient's symptoms resolved. This corresponded with an 80% reduction in the tumour volume radiologically. CONCLUSION: BromAc(®) is an emerging minimally invasive treatment for PMP tumour deposits that may be considered as adjunctive or alternative treatment in patients who are not surgical candidates to reduce tumour burden and improve symptomatology and quality of life.",0
Impact of Opioid Dose Reductions on Patient-Reported Mental Health and Suicide-Related Behavior and Relationship to Patient Choice in Tapering Decisions.,"Mental health and suicide-related harms resulting from prescription opioid tapering are poorly documented and understood. Six health systems contributed opioid prescribing data from January 2016 to April 2020. Patients 18 to 70 years old with evidence of opioid tapering participated in semi-structured interviews. Individuals who experienced suicide attempts were oversampled. Family members of suicide decedents who had experienced opioid tapering were also interviewed. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. The study participants included 176 patients and 16 family members. Patients were 68% female, 80% White, and 15% Hispanic, mean age 58. All family members were female spouses of White, non-Hispanic male decedents. Among the subgroup (n = 60) who experienced a documented suicide attempt, reported experiencing suicidal ideation during tapering, or were family members of suicide decedents, 40% reported that opioid tapering exacerbated previously recognized mental health issues, and 25% reported that tapering triggered new-onset mental health concerns. Among participants with suicide behavior, 47% directly attributed it to opioid tapering. Common precipitants included increased pain, reduced life engagement, sleep problems, withdrawal, relationship dissolution, and negative consequences of opioid substitution with other substances for pain relief. Most respondents reporting suicide behavior felt that the decision to taper was made by the health care system or a clinician (67%) whereas patients not reporting suicide behavior were more likely to report it was their own decision (42%). This study describes patient-reported mental health deterioration or suicide behavior while tapering prescription opioids. Clinicians should screen for, monitor, and treat suicide behavior while assisting patients in tapering opioids. PERSPECTIVE: This work describes changes in patient-reported mental health and suicide behavior while tapering prescription opioids. Recommendations for improving care include mental health and suicide risk screening during and following opioid tapering.",0
"Effectiveness, reach, uptake, and feasibility of digital health interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.","BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions have shown promising results for the management of type 2 diabetes, but a comparison of the effectiveness and implementation of the different modes is not currently available. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of SMS, smartphone application, and website-based interventions on improving glycaemia in adults with type 2 diabetes and report on their reach, uptake, and feasibility. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo on May 25, 2022, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of digital health interventions in reducing glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) in adults with type 2 diabetes, published in English from Jan 1, 2009. Screening was carried out using Covidence, and data were extracted following Cochrane's guidelines. The primary endpoint assessed was the change in the mean (and 95% CI) plasma concentration of HbA(1c) at 3 months or more. Cochrane risk of bias 2 was used to assess risk of bias. Data on reach, uptake, and feasibility were summarised narratively and data on HbA(1c) reduction were synthesised in a meta-analysis. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria was used to evaluate the level of evidence. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021247845. FINDINGS: Of the 3236 records identified, 56 RCTs from 24 regions (n=11 486 participants), were included in the narrative synthesis, and 26 studies (n=4546 participants) in the meta-analysis. 20 studies used SMS as the primary mode of delivery of the digital health intervention, 25 used smartphone applications, and 11 implemented interventions via websites. Smartphone application interventions reported higher reach compared with SMS and website-based interventions, but website-based interventions reported higher uptake compared with SMS and smartphone application interventions. Effective interventions, in general, included people with greater severity of their condition at baseline (ie, higher HbA(1c)) and administration of a higher dose intensity of the intervention, such as more frequent use of smartphone applications. Overall, digital health intervention group participants had a -0·30 (95% CI -0·42 to -0·19) percentage point greater reduction in HbA(1c), compared with control group participants. The difference in HbA(1c) reduction between groups was statistically significant when interventions were delivered through smartphone applications (-0·42% [-0·63 to -0·20]) and via SMS (-0·37% [-0·57 to -0·17]), but not when delivered via websites (-0·09% [-0·64 to 0·46]). Due to the considerable heterogeneity between included studies, the level of evidence was moderate overall. INTERPRETATION: Smartphone application and SMS interventions, but not website-based interventions, were associated with better glycaemic control. However, the studies' heterogeneity should be recognised. Considering that both smartphone application and SMS interventions are effective for diabetes management, clinicians should consider factors such as reach, uptake, patient preference, and context of the intervention when deciding on the mode of delivery of the intervention. Nine in ten people worldwide own a feature phone and can receive SMS and four in five people have access to a smartphone, with numerous smartphone applications being available for diabetes management. Clinicians should familiarise themselves with this modality of programme delivery and encourage people with type 2 diabetes to use evidence-based applications for improving their self-management of diabetes. Future research needs to describe in detail the mediators and moderators of the effectiveness and implementation of SMS and smartphone application interventions, such as the optimal dose, frequency, timing, user interface, and communication mode to both further improve their effectiveness and to increase their reach, uptake, and feasibility.

Community-Engaged Research (CEnR) to Address Gaps in Chronic Kidney Disease Education among Underserved Latines-The CARE Study.,"Ensuring equitable chronic kidney disease (CKD) education for Latine patients with low health literacy and low English proficiency stands as a critical challenge, and the ""Caridad Awareness and Education"" (CARE) initiative represents our ongoing effort to address this imperative issue. In collaboration with twenty-three patients living with CKD, diabetes and/or hypertension and twelve trained Community Health Workers (CHWs) from diverse Latine subgroups, we conducted a research initiative funded by the National Kidney Foundation. Our primary objective was to co-design and test culturally tailored patient education materials (PEMs) for underserved Latine adults at risk for or diagnosed with CKD. We effectively integrated Community-Engaged Research (CEnR) principles with a Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach to create a range of CKD-PEM prototypes in Spanish. Patient preferences for printed educational materials were clear. They favored printed materials that incorporated visual content with concise text over digital, email, texts, or online resources and personalized phone outreach and the involvement of CHWs. Additionally, patients identified their unwavering commitment to their families as a forceful motivator for caring for their kidney health. Currently, a culturally and linguistically tailored CKD flipchart for one-on-one education, led by CHWs, is undergoing a pilot testing phase involving a sample of one hundred Latine patients at risk for or diagnosed with CKD. This innovative approach signifies a commitment to amplifying the insights and expertise of the Latine community afflicted by kidney health disparities, effectively embracing a CEnR to forge meaningful and impactful CKD-PEMs.",0
Mechanical Thrombectomy for Acute and Subacute Blocked Arteries and Veins in the Lower Limbs: A Health Technology Assessment.,"BACKGROUND: A blockage to the blood vessels in the lower extremities may cause pain and discomfort. If left unmanaged, it may lead to amputation or chronic disability, such as in the form of post-thrombotic syndrome. We conducted a health technology assessment of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) devices, which are proposed to remove a blood clot, which may form in the arteries or veins of the lower legs. This evaluation considered blockages in the veins and arteries separately, and included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding MT for lower limb blockages, patient preferences and values, and clinical and health system stakeholders' perspectives. METHOD: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Cochrane tool for randomized controlled trials or the risk of bias among non-randomized studies (RoBANS) tool for nonrandomized studies, and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature search. We did not conduct a primary economic evaluation since the clinical evidence is highly uncertain. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding MT treatment for inpatients with arterial acute limb ischemia and acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower limb in Ontario. To contextualize the potential value of MT, we spoke with people with acute DVT. To understand the barriers and facilitators of accessing MT, we surveyed clinical and health system stakeholders to gain their perspectives. RESULTS: We included 40 studies (3 randomized controlled trials and 37 observational studies) in the clinical evidence review. For patients who experience arterial acute limb ischemia, compared with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) alone, MT has greater technical success and patency and reduced hospital length of stay, but the evidence for these outcomes is uncertain (GRADE: Very low). Mechanical thrombectomy may reduce the volume of thrombolytic medication required and CDT infusion time (a determinant for intensive care unit [ICU] need) in patients experiencing acute DVT, but it is uncertain if this is to a meaningful degree (GRADE: Moderate to Very low). It may also reduce the proportion of people who experience post-thrombotic syndrome and overall hospital length of stay, but it is uncertain (GRADE: Very low).We estimated that publicly funding MT for people with arterial acute limb ischemia in Ontario would lead to an annual cost savings of $0.17 million in year 1 to $0.14 million in year 5, for a total savings of $0.83 million over 5 years. This cost savings was mainly attributed to reduced ICU stays among people who received MT, but the results had considerable uncertainty. For the population with acute DVT, publicly funding MT would lead to an additional cost of $0.77 million in year 1 to $1.44 million in year 5, for a total additional cost of $5.5 million over 5 years.The people with acute DVT with whom we spoke reported that MT was generally seen as a positive option, and those who had undergone the procedure reported positively on its value as a treatment to quickly remove a clot. Accessing treatment for DVT could be a barrier, especially in more remote areas of Ontario.Clinicians using the technology advised that facilitators to accessing the technology included perceived improvements in patient outcomes, resourcing requirements, addressing unmet needs, and avoidance of ICU stay. The main barrier identified was cost. Clinicians who were not using the technology advised that barriers were low case-use volume, along with costs for the equipment and for health human resources. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy may have greater technical success and patency and reduce hospital length of stay for patients experiencing an arterial acute limb ischemia and, for patients with an acute DVT, it may reduce CDT volume and infusion time, the proportion of people who experience post-thrombotic syndrome, and hospital length of stay. Mechanical thrombectomy may reduce the associated ICU costs, but it has higher equipment costs compared with usual care. Publicly funding MT in Ontario for populations with arterial acute limb ischemia may not lead to a substantial budget increase to the province. Publicly funding MT for acute DVT would lead to an additional cost of $5.5 million over 5 years. For people with acute DVT, MT was seen as a potential positive treatment option to remove the clot quickly. Overall, the majority of clinical stakeholders we engaged with (including both those with and without experience with MT) were supportive of the use of the technology.",0
[Geographical access to hemodialysis: an analysis of patient choices].,"INTRODUCTION: Patients do not always go to the facility closest to their home. DESCRIPTION: A study was carried out in Provence-Alpes Côtes d'Azur (PACA) on patients' preferences to mobilize the hemodialysis offer. METHODS: The data were extracted from the REIN Registry. Potential access was compared with actual access. A survey was carried out among a sample of patients travelling an additional distance of more than 25 km. RESULTS: About a quarter of the patients did not travel to the nearest facility. Of these, 16.3% travelled an additional distance of over 25 km. Patients' choices were determined by the relationship of trust with the team that first set up dialysis, followed by their desire to be followed in a multi-purpose facility. DISCUSSION: While distance remained the decisive factor, human factors were cited in the majority of cases to explain the bypass. CONCLUSION: The links between the first team and the next one should be strengthened.",0
Predictors of Informed People's Preferences for Statin Therapy to Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Risk: an Internet Survey Study.,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines suggest clinicians inform patients about their 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; however, little is known about how the risk estimate influences patients' preferences for statin therapy for primary prevention. OBJECTIVE: To define predictors of preference for statin therapy after participants were informed about their individualized benefits and harms. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey in 2020. SETTING: Online US survey panel. PARTICIPANTS: A national sample of 304 respondents aged 40 to 75 who had not previously taken a statin and who knew their cholesterol levels and blood pressure measurements. INTERVENTION: Participants entered their risk factors into a calculator which estimated their 10-year CVD risk. They were then provided with an estimate of their absolute risk reduction with a statin and the chance of side effects from meta-analyses. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: We used a hierarchical model to predict participants' preferences for statin therapy according to their 10-year CVD risk, perceptions of the magnitude of statin benefit (large, medium, small, or almost no benefit), worry about side effects (very worried, somewhat worried, a little worried, not worried at all), and other variables. KEY RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 55 years (SD = 9.9); 50% were female, 44% were non-white, and 16% had a high school degree or less education. After reviewing their benefits and side effects, 45% of the participants reported they probably or definitely wanted to take a statin. In the full hierarchical model, only perceived benefits of taking a statin was a significant independent predictor of wanting a statin (OR 7.3, 95% CI 4.7, 12.2). LIMITATIONS: Participants were from an internet survey panel and making hypothetical decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Participants' perceptions of their benefit from statin therapy predicted wanting to take a statin for primary prevention; neither estimated CVD risk nor worries about statin side effects were independent predictors.",0
Ultrasound-Guided Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block.,"Pain management is an integral part of providing care in the emergency setting. Lower extremity pain from hip fractures, burns, and other trauma is a common presenting complaint. Unfortunately, pain management can be difficult due to medication side effects, patient preferences, and other patient characteristics that can make intravenous analgesia less desirable. Opioid medications can be associated with respiratory depression, hypotension, mental status changes, and vomiting. NSAIDs can increase bleeding risk and exacerbate underlying gastrointestinal (GI) problems. Acetaminophen alone is often not sufficient for severe pain. Hip fractures, in particular, can cause considerable pain, and often occur in elderly adults with multiple comorbidities which make analgesia challenging. A fascia iliaca compartment block can provide superior analgesia with minimal side effects. It can be deployed in a relatively quick fashion after a small amount of training and can be executed with high success rates under ultrasound guidance. In a study by Monzon et al., patients who received a fascia iliaca compartment block for a hip fracture had significantly reduced pain levels. The pain was initially rated at an average of 8.5 on a 10 point scale but decreased to an average of 2.3 at 2 hours post-injection. In a study by Stevens et al., in Anesthesia Intensive Care, patients who underwent a fascia iliaca compartment block used significantly less morphine over the course of 24 hours than the control group which used morphine alone. An additional advantage is the duration of effect, which has been seen for 8 to 10 hours following a single shot block. Another randomized placebo-controlled trial showed that pain relief was superior at all time points measured in the fascia iliac compartment block group as compared with a group utilizing morphine only. In fact, median total morphine consumption in the compartment block group was 0 mg due to excellent analgesia after only a compartment block. Similar results were seen in a study by Lopez et al. for femoral shaft fractures. Emergency department-specific studies using ultrasound guidance have shown 76% mean reduction of pain score in patients with hip fracture at 120 minutes.",0
Orthodontic Aligners: Current Perspectives for the Modern Orthodontic Office.,"Orthodontic aligners are changing the practice of orthodontics. This system of orthodontic appliances is becoming the mainstay appliance of choice for orthodontic offices in many countries. Patient preferences and lifestyle needs have made this appliance the primary choice when seeking care. In the early days, appliances lacked the efficiency and effectiveness of traditional bracket-wire systems, but modern systems are now able to handle a more comprehensive orthodontic caseload. Current systems provide newer biomechanical strategies and artificial intelligence-driven tooth movements for better outcomes. These improvements now mean that an orthodontist can be better prepared to manage a larger number of orthodontic malocclusions. This paper aims to discuss some of the evolution of orthodontic aligners and to describe to orthodontists the fundamentals of aligner therapy. In addition, it will provide an evidence-based outcome to the existing treatment outcomes in the current literature.",0
Persistent obstructive sleep apnoea in children: treatment options and management considerations.,"Unresolved obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) after an adenotonsillectomy, henceforth referred to as persistent OSA, is increasingly recognised in children (2-18 years). Although associated with obesity, underlying medical complexity, and craniofacial disorders, persistent OSA also occurs in otherwise healthy children. Inadequate treatment of persistent OSA can lead to long-term adverse health outcomes beyond childhood. Positive airway pressure, used as a one-size-fits-all primary management strategy for persistent childhood OSA, is highly efficacious but has unacceptably low adherence rates. A pressing need exists for a broader, more effective management approach for persistent OSA in children. In this Personal View, we discuss the use and the need for evaluation of current and novel therapeutics, the role of shared decision-making models that consider patient preferences, and the importance of considering the social determinants of health in research and clinical practice. A multipronged, comprehensive approach to persistent OSA might achieve better clinical outcomes in childhood and promote health equity for all children.",0
Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Statement: Clinical considerations for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants.,"Respiratory syncytial virus is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract illness globally in children aged <5 years. Each year, approximately 58,000 hospitalizations in the United States are attributed to respiratory syncytial virus. Infants aged ≤6 months experience the most severe morbidity and mortality. Until recently, prevention with the monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, was only offered to infants with high-risk conditions, and treatment primarily consisted of supportive care. Currently, 2 products are approved for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus in infants. These include the Pfizer bivalent recombinant respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein subunit vaccine, administered seasonally to the pregnant person between 32 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation, and the monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab, administered to infants aged up to 8 months entering their first respiratory syncytial virus season. With few exceptions, administering both the vaccine to the pregnant person and the monoclonal antibody to the infant is not recommended. All infants should be protected against respiratory syncytial virus using one of these strategies. Key considerations for pregnant individuals include examining available safety and efficacy data, weighing accessibility and availability, and patient preferences for maternal vaccination vs infant monoclonal antibody treatment. It will be critical for maternal-fetal medicine physicians to provide effective and balanced counseling to aid patients in deciding on a personalized approach to the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus in their infants.",0
Physician awareness of patients' preferred level of involvement in decision-making at the initial urogynecology visit: a randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown up to a 40% discordance between patients' preferred roles in decision-making before and their perceived roles after their visit. This can negatively affect patients' experiences; interventions to minimize this discordance may significantly improve patient satisfaction. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine whether physicians' awareness of patients' preferred involvement in decision-making before their initial urogynecology visit affects patients' perceived level of involvement after their visit. STUDY DESIGN: This randomized controlled trial enrolled adult English-speaking women presenting for their initial visit at an academic urogynecology clinic from June 2022 to September 2022. Before the visit, participants completed the Control Preference Scale to determine the patient's preferred level of decision-making: active, collaborative, or passive. The participants were randomized to either the physician team being aware of their decision-making preference before the visit or usual care. The participants were blinded. After the visit, participants again completed a Control Preference Scale and the Patient Global Impression of Improvement, CollaboRATE, patient satisfaction, and health literacy questionnaires. Fisher exact, logistic regression, and generalized estimating equations were used. Based on a 21% difference in preferred and perceived discordance, we calculated the sample size to be 50 patients in each arm to achieve 80% power. RESULTS: Women (n=100) with a mean age of 52.9 years (standard deviation=15.8) participated in the study. Most participants identified as White (73%) and non-Hispanic (70%). Before the visit, most women preferred an active role (61%) and few preferred a passive role (7%). There was no significant difference between the 2 cohorts in the discordance between their pre- and post-Control Preference Scale responses (27% vs 37%; P=.39) or whether their symptoms were much better or very much better following the visit (18% vs 37%; P=.06). However, when asked whether they were completely satisfied with the visit, those assigned to the physician awareness cohort reported higher satisfaction than those in the treatment as usual cohort (100% vs 90%; P=.03). CONCLUSION: Although there was no significant decrease in discordance between the patient's desired and perceived level of decision-making following physician awareness, it had a significant effect on patient satisfaction. All patients whose physicians were aware of their preferences reported complete satisfaction with their visit. Although patient-centered care does not always entail meeting all of the patients' expectations, the mere understanding of their preferences in decision-making can lead to complete patient satisfaction.",0
Patient preferences for telehealth services in a large multispecialty practice.,"INTRODUCTION: Telehealth service provision has accelerated during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As the pandemic continues, clinical practices have discovered ways to resume operations. Opportunities exist to understand patient preferences for telehealth clinical services and to tailor offerings to different demographic groups. METHODS: We conducted a survey of patients receiving telehealth services through our outpatient practice to understand the types of healthcare services for which patients report preferences for telehealth. RESULTS: We received 551 survey responses (response rate = 20.8%; 551/2650). More than half of patients indicated being 'very likely' to use telehealth services to refill medication(s) (67.3%), prepare for an upcoming visit (66.1%), review test results (60.3%), or receive education (54.2%). Males had lower odds of preferring telehealth services for reviewing test results (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34-0.94) or mental health issues (OR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.38-0.77). Respondents who received a video visit were significantly more likely than those who received a telephone visit to report preferences for using telehealth for education, care plan discussions, long-term health issues, and mental health. DISCUSSION: Patient preferences for telehealth services vary by services provided and respondent demographics. Experience with telehealth increases the likelihood for future use of these services.",0
Jargon Be Gone - Patient Preference in Doctor Communication.,"While it has been shown that healthcare providers often use medical jargon, less is known about how patients prefer their clinicians communicate. This mixed-methods study aimed to better understand the general public's preference in healthcare communication. A volunteer cohort of 205 adult attendees at the 2021 Minnesota State Fair was presented a survey with two scenarios at a doctor's office sharing the same information: one using medical terminology and one using simpler, jargon-free language. Survey participants were asked which doctor they preferred, to describe each doctor, and to explain why they believe that doctors may use medical terminology. Common descriptive themes for the jargon-using doctor included that this doctor caused confusion, was too technical, and was uncaring, while the doctor who spoke without jargon was perceived as a good communicator, caring/empathetic, and approachable. Respondents perceived a range of reasons why doctors use jargon, from not recognizing they are using words that are not understood to trying to make themselves feel more important. Overall, 91% of survey respondents preferred the doctor who communicated without medical jargon.",0
The application of discrete choice experiments eliciting young peoples' preferences for healthcare: a systematic literature review.,"OBJECTIVES: Understanding young people's preferences for healthcare is critical for reducing the negative effect of undesirable choices. This review aims to synthesise the evidence obtained from discrete choice experiments (DCEs) eliciting young people's preferences for healthcare interventions and service deliveries, specifically, to (1) examine the methodology, including a selection of attributes and levels, experimental design, estimation procedure and validity; (2) evaluate similarities, differences and rigour of designs to the general population DCEs; and, (3) compare the DCEs' application to the seven health priority areas defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO). METHODS: A systematic review searching Medline, EconLIT, PsychINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed up until May 2021. INCLUSION CRITERIA: a DCE, eliciting young peoples' preferences (10-24 years of age), on a healthcare-related topic defined by WHO, peer-reviewed, full-text available in English. A bespoke checklist was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. RESULTS: Eighteen DCE studies were included in the review, exploring interventions and service in sexual and reproductive health (n = 9; 50%), smoking cessation (n = 4; 22%), mental health (n = 1), nutrition (n = 1), unintentional injuries (n = 1), vaccination against severe but rare diseases (n = 1); and diabetes (n = 1). Compared to the general population, DCEs eliciting young people's preferences had a high proportion of monetary measures and a smaller number of choices per respondent with the overwhelming number of surveys using fractional factorial design. The majority of studies were of moderate quality (50-75% of the criteria met). CONCLUSIONS: While identified DCEs touched on most health priority areas, the scope was limited. The conduct and reporting of DCEs with young people could be improved by including the state-of-the-art design, estimation procedures and analysis.",1
Patient choice: the shape of consent post-Montgomery.,"The law relating to consent and the process dentists need to go through to gain valid and informed consent to treat patients changed significantly following the landmark ruling of Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board. In this paper, we revisit the history of patient consent, give an update on the current legal situation in the UK, and produce a unique 'consent workflow' to aid in the process of gaining valid and informed consent to treat. The aim is to clarify the legal standing and provide a framework that dentists and other healthcare professionals can adapt to their current clinical practice while increasing the confidence of those involved in the consent process; both professionals and patients.",0
"Prevalence, attitudes and concerns toward telepsychiatry and mobile health self-management tools among patients with mental disorders during and after the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide survey in Poland from 2020 to 2023.","INTRODUCTION: Mobile Health (mHealth) is a rapidly growing field of medicine that has the potential to significantly change everyday clinical practice, including in psychiatry. The COVID-19 pandemic and technological developments have accelerated the adoption of telepsychiatry and mobile solutions, but patient perceptions and expectations of mHealth remain a key factor in its implementation. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess (1) the prevalence, (2) attitudes, preferences and (3) concerns about mobile mental health, including telepsychiatry and self-management tools, among patients with mental disorders over the period 2020-2023, i.e., at the onset, peak and after the expiration of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A semi-structured survey was administrated to 354 patients with mental disorders in Poland. The questions were categorized into three section, addressing prevalence, attitudes, and concerns about telepsychiatry and mobile health self-management tools. The survey was conducted continuously from May 2020 to the end of May 2023. RESULT: As many as 95.7% of patients with mental disorders used mobile devices at least once a week. Over the course of 3 years (from 2020 to 2023), there was a significant increase in the readiness of patients to embrace new technologies, with the percentage rising from 20% to 40%. In particular, a remarkable growth in patient preferences for telepsychiatry was observed, with a significant increase from 47% in 2020 to a substantial 96% in 2023. Similarly, mHealth self-management tools were of high interest to patients. In 2020, 62% of patients like the idea of using mobile apps and other mobile health tools to support the care and treatment process. This percentage also increased during the pandemic, reaching 66% in 2023. At the same time, the percentage of patients who have concerns about using m-health solutions has gradually decreased, reaching 35% and 28% in 2023 for telepsychiatry and for the reliability and safety of m-health self-management tools, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the growing acceptance of modern technologies in psychiatric care, with patients showing increased readiness to use telepsychiatry and mobile health self-management tools, in particular mobile applications, after the COVID-19 pandemic. This was triggered by the pandemic, but continues despite its expiry. In the face of patient readiness, the key issue now is to ensure the safety and efficacy of these tools, along with providing clear guidelines for clinicians. It is also necessary to draw the attention of health systems to the widespread implementation of these technologies to improve the care of patients with mental disorders.",0
Nurses' work experiences in hospital wards with single rooms: An integrative review.,"AIM AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate evidence that examined nurses' work experiences in hospital wards with single rooms. The research question was 'What does the research tell us about nurses' work experiences in hospital wards with single rooms?' BACKGROUND: In the last decades, new hospital builds have moved towards including a high proportion of single rooms. Yet, single rooms create 'complex environments' that impact the nurses. DESIGN: A structured integrative review was undertaken of empirical evidence. METHODS: Original, peer-reviewed articles, written in English, were sourced from four databases: CINAHL, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. The initial searches were performed in April 2021 and repeated in December 2022. Quality appraisal was undertaken using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. A narrative synthesis approach was used to analyse the data. Reporting was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. RESULTS: Twelve studies, published between 2006 and 2022, with an international origin, and representing n = 826 nurses, were included in this review. The synthesis revealed mixed perspectives about nurses' work experiences in wards with single rooms. Whilst single rooms are 'all good in theory (and) a good idea', the reality was quite different. Synthesised findings are presented in four categories: (i) aesthetics and the physical space, (ii) privacy vs. isolation, (iii) safety, which includes situational awareness and (iv) communication and collaboration. CONCLUSION: This review describes how single rooms affects nurses' work experience. Whilst nurses shared multiple concerns about single rooms and the challenges they also acknowledged patient preference for the privacy and space afforded by single rooms. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Findings from this review highlight the need for careful planning to maintain and strengthen teamwork, prevent nurses' sense of working in isolation, as well as creating opportunities for mentorship, and collaboration among nurses when working in single-room settings.",0
Long-term outcomes of Gamma Knife radiosurgery in treating glossopharyngeal neuralgia.,"Glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN) is an unusual disorder causing severe, brief pain episodes in the areas supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve. Initial treatment involves medications like carbamazepine, but if these are ineffective or cause side effects, interventional pain management techniques or surgery may be considered. Gamma Knife radiosurgery is becoming popular in managing GPN due to its lower risk of complications than surgical interventions like microvascular decompression or rhizotomy. In this retrospective case series, we examined the outcomes of Gamma Knife radiosurgery in eight patients with GPN. The decision to utilize Gamma Knife radiosurgery was made following specific criteria, including failed surgical interventions, patient preference against surgery, or contraindications to surgical procedures. Patients were administered radiation doses within the range of 80 to 90 Gy, targeting either the cisternal glossopharyngeal nerve or glossopharyngeal meatus of the jugular foramen. Evaluations were conducted before the Gamma Knife radiosurgery; at 3, 6, and 12 months after Gamma Knife radiosurgery; and annually thereafter. Pain severity was assessed using the modified Barrow Neurological Institute scale grades, with patients achieving grade I-IIIa considered to have a good treatment outcome and grade IV-V to have a poor treatment outcome. Pain control and absence of radiosurgery-related complications were primary endpoints. The median age of the patients was 46.5 years, varying from 8 to 72 years. The median duration of pain was 32 months (range, 12-120 months). All patients, except one, were on polydrug therapy. All cases exhibited preoperative grade V pain. The median follow-up duration after Gamma Knife radiosurgery was 54.5 months, varying from 14 to 90 months. The overall clinical assessments revealed a gradual neurological improvement, particularly within the first 8.5 weeks (range, 1-12 weeks). The immediate outcomes at 3 months revealed that all patients (8/8, 100%) experienced pain relief, with 25% (2/8) achieving a medication-free status (Grade I). Three patients (37%) experienced a recurrence during the follow-up and were managed with repeat Gamma Knife radiosurgery (n = 2) and radiofrequency rhizotomy (n = 1). At the last follow-up, 88% (7/8) of patients had pain relief (Grades I-IIIa), with three (37%) achieving a medication-free status (Grade I). No adverse events or neurological complications occurred. The patient who underwent radiofrequency rhizotomy continued to experience inadequately controlled pain despite medication (Grade IV). Gamma Knife radiosurgery is a non-invasive, efficacious treatment option for idiopathic GPN, offering short- and long-term relief without permanent complications.",0
Implementation of a Standardized Shared Decision-making Bundle to Improve Communication Practices in the Neurocritical Care Unit.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Shared decision-making (SDM) aligns patient preferences with health care team treatment goals. This quality improvement initiative implemented a standardized SDM bundle within a neurocritical care unit (NCCU), where unique demands make existing, provider-driven SDM practices challenging. METHODS: An interprofessional team defined key issues, identified barriers, and created change ideas to drive implementation of an SDM bundle using the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Model for Improvement framework incorporating Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. The SDM bundle included (1) a health care team huddle pre-SDM and post-SDM conversation; (2) a social worker-driven SDM conversation with the patient family, including core standardized communication elements to ensure consistency and quality; and (3) an SDM documentation tool within the electronic medical record to ensure the SDM conversation was accessible to all health care team members. The primary outcome measure was percentage of SDM conversations documented. RESULTS: Documentation of SDM conversations improved by 56%, from 27% to 83% pre/postintervention. Average time to documentation decreased by 4 days, from day 9 preintervention to day 5 postintervention. There was no significant change in NCCU length of stay, nor did palliative care consultation rates increase. Postintervention, SDM team huddle compliance was 94.3%. DISCUSSION: A team-driven, standardized SDM bundle that integrates with health care team workflows enabled SDM conversations to occur earlier and resulted in improved documentation of SDM conversations. Team-driven SDM bundles have the potential to improve communication and promote early alignment with patient family goals, preferences, and values.",0
[Chronic Kidney Disease and Cancer: Ethical Choices].,"Cancer and chronic kidney disease prevalence both increase with age. As a consequence, physicians are more frequently encountering older people with cancer who need dialysis, or patients on dialysis diagnosed with cancer. Decisions in this context are particularly complex and multifaceted. Informed decisions about dialysis require a personalised care plan that considers the prognosis and treatment options for each condition while also respecting patient preferences. The concept of prognosis should include quality-of-life considerations, functional status, and burden of care. Close collaboration between oncologists, nephrologists, geriatricians and palliativists is crucial to making optimal treatment decisions, and several tools are available for estimating cancer prognosis, prognosis of renal disease, and general age-related prognosis. Decision regarding the initiation or the termination of dialysis in patients with advanced cancer have also ethical implications. This last point is discussed in this article, and we delved into ethical issues with the aim of providing a pathway for the nephrologist to manage an elderly patient with ESRD and cancer.",0
Patient preferences and comfort for cancer survivorship models of care: results of an online survey.,"PURPOSE: Workforce shortages will impact oncologists' ability to provide both active and survivorship care. While primary care provider (PCP) or survivorship clinic transition has been emphasized, there is little evidence regarding patient comfort. METHODS: We developed an online survey in partnership with patient advocates to assess survivors' comfort with PCP or survivorship clinic care and distributed the survey to online, cancer-specific patient communities from June to August 2020. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 975 surveys were complete. Most respondents were women (91%) and had private insurance (65%). Thirty-six cancer types were reported. Ninety-three percent had a PCP. Twenty-four percent were comfortable seeing a PCP for survivorship care. Higher odds of comfort were seen among respondents who were Black or had stage 0 cancer; female sex was associated with lower odds. Fifty-five percent were comfortable with a survivorship clinic. Higher odds of comfort were seen with lymphoma or ovarian cancer, > 15 years from diagnosis, and non-US government insurance. Lower odds were seen with melanoma, advanced stage, Medicaid insurance, and one late effect. Preference for PCP care was 87% for general health, 32% for recurrence monitoring, and 37% for late effect management. CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of cancer survivors were comfortable with PCP-led survivorship care and about half with a survivorship clinic. Most preferred oncologist care for recurrence monitoring and late-effect management. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Patient preference and comfort should be considered when developing survivorship care models. Future efforts should focus on facilitating patient-centered transitions to non-oncologist care.",0
Dietary Management of Eosinophilic Esophagitis.,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune-mediated food antigen-driven disease characterized by tissue eosinophilia and clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction. Medical and dietary therapies can be offered as treatment options in both pediatric and adult populations. Advances in nutritional research in EoE have produced different levels of dietary restriction, ranging from elimination of a single food group to more extensive restriction such as the two-food elimination diet, four-food elimination diet, or six-food elimination diet. Efficacy and outcomes vary for each level of restriction. The option of using dietary therapy allows clinicians to partner with patients in shared decision-making to balance the right level of food antigen restriction for the desired outcome. Key considerations when choosing dietary therapy hinge on patient preference and resources, food-related quality of life, and the ability to provide nutritional diversity and maintain nutritional parameters. This article highlights these considerations and offers clinical pearls to guide clinicians who wish to incorporate dietary therapy of EoE into their practice.",0
Cervical preparation for second-trimester procedural abortion.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the evidence-informed options for cervical preparation prior to second-trimester dilation and evacuation (D&E). RECENT FINDINGS: As abortion restrictions increase and the number of abortion clinics and providers decreases, pregnant people are facing more barriers to abortion access. Those in need are now often required to travel for second-trimester abortion care, only to be faced with additional restrictions, such as mandatory waiting periods. Cervical preparation is recommended prior to D&E and takes time for effect. Given the increasing time required to obtain an abortion, patients and providers may prefer same-day cervical preparation to decrease the total time required. Options for same-day cervical preparation include misoprostol alone with single or serial doses, and misoprostol combined with osmotic dilators or transcervical balloon (Foley catheter). Same-day preparation may require additional clinical space to accommodate people after initiation of cervical preparation to manage side-effects and timing of the abortion. Overnight options are also used and more frequently later in the second trimester. Overnight options include mifepristone, osmotic dilators, and transcervical balloon and are often combined with same-day misoprostol. Medication alone preparation is well tolerated and effective in the second trimester, with the addition of mechanical methods with advancing gestation. With many options and combinations being safe and effective, providers can be dynamic and alter approach with supply shortages, adjust to different clinical settings, consider patient medical and surgical factors, and accommodate provider and patient preferences. SUMMARY: Multiple pharmacologic and mechanical options have been shown to be safe and effective for cervical preparation prior to D&E. Consideration for multiple factors should influence the method of cervical preparation and methods may vary by patient, provider and setting.",0
"Exploring herbal remedy utilization for wound healing: Patterns, patient preferences, and implications for nursing practice.","PURPOSE: The utilization of herbal remedies for wound healing is a notable aspect of traditional medicine practices. Understanding herbal use among patients yields insights for nursing care enhancement. This study aimed to investigate the utilization of herbal remedies for wound healing among diabetic patients. METHODS: A total of 453 participants were enrolled, with demographic data, including age, sex, occupation, education level, residence, ethnic group, distance from health service, herbal use duration, and wound duration presented. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data, including means, standard deviations, ranges, and percentages. FINDINGS: The average participant age was 55.39 years, with most being non-civil servant workers (60.3%) and having a low education level (67.1%). Indian almond wood (9.7%) and green betel (6.8%) were the most commonly used herbs for wound healing. Family members were the primary source of information (29.1%), and 43.7% obtained herbs from personal gardens. Although 94.2% of participants did not disclose herbal use to health liaisons, 53.4% used herbs specifically for wound healing. Users reported both positive and negative effects on wounds from various herbs, indicating variability in experiences. However, the consistency of herb usage by individual patients was uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified diverse herbal remedies used for wound healing among patients, driven by familial recommendations. Usage pattern diversity and effects signal necessity for researching herb safety and efficacy. Clarifying the impact of consistent herb usage on wound healing is essential for understanding patients' preferences and practices. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: These findings emphasize the importance of open communication between patients and healthcare providers regarding herbal remedy use. Nurses should acknowledge patients' preferences for traditional healing practices while ensuring they receive evidence-based care. Patient-centered herbal strategies enhance nursing practice, fostering holistic wound care. Further research can guide nursing interventions, facilitate informed decision-making, and improve patient outcomes.",0
"Duration of Follow-up and Timing of Discharge from Imaging Follow-up, in Adult Patients with Urolithiasis After Surgical or Medical Intervention: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis from the European Association of Urology Guideline Panel on Urolithiasi","CONTEXT: No algorithm exists for structured follow-up of urolithiasis patients. OBJECTIVE: To provide a discharge time point during follow-up of urolithiasis patients after treatment. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic review of PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, and reference lists according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. Fifty studies were eligible. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: From a pooled analysis of 5467 stone-free patients, we estimated that for a safety margin of 80% for remaining stone free, patients should be followed up using imaging, for at least 2 yr (radiopaque stones) or 3 yr (radiolucent stones) before being discharged. Patients should be discharged after 5 yr of no recurrence with a safety margin of 90%. Regarding residual disease, patients with fragments ≤4 mm could be offered surveillance up to 4 yr since intervention rates range between 17% and 29%, disease progression between 9% and 34%, and spontaneous passage between 21% and 34% at 49 mo. Patients with larger residual fragments should be offered further definitive intervention since intervention rates are high (24-100%). Insufficient data exist for high-risk patients, but the current literature dictates that patients who are adherent to targeted medical treatment seem to experience less stone growth or regrowth of residual fragments, and may be discharged after 36-48 mo of nonprogressive disease on imaging. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that stone-free patients with radiopaque or radiolucent stones should be followed up to 2 or 3 yr, respectively. In patients with residual fragments ≤4 mm, surveillance or intervention can be advised according to patient preferences and characteristics, while for those with larger residual fragments, reintervention should be scheduled. PATIENT SUMMARY: Here, we review the literature regarding follow-up of urolithiasis patients. Patients who have no stones after treatment should be seen up to 2-3 yr, those with large fragments should be reoperated, and those with small fragments could be offered surveillance with imaging.",0
Patient Preferences Regarding Surgical Treatment Methods for Symptomatic Uterine Fibroids.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to rank the factors that are most and least important to patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids when considering surgical treatment options. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a best worst scaling (BWS) preference elicitation approach, participants completed an online survey to rank factors associated with fibroid surgical treatments. Survey content was based on a literature review and included the following factors: symptom relief; surgical complications; repeat treatment; recovery time; cosmetic effects; risk of spreading undiagnosed cancer; sexual outcomes; maintenance of child-bearing; continuation of menses; unpredictable menses; and location of procedure. Participants completed 11 BWS tasks. For each task, we presented participants with a subset of 5 factors from the possible 11, and participants chose the most important and least important factor. Participants' responses were analyzed using conditional logistic regression to determine the relative importance of factors. Patient priorities were further explored via age and race. RESULTS: 285 respondents with symptomatic uterine fibroids (69 physician-confirmed and 216 self-reported) who had not undergone prior surgical treatment completed the survey. Respondents were enrolled from two clinical sites (clinical site cohort) and an online consumer panel (panel cohort). Both cohorts identified symptom relief, cancer risk, repeat treatment and complications as the most important factors in selecting surgical treatment options and location of procedure, return to normal activities after surgery, and cosmetic effects like presence of a scar after the surgical treatment as the least important factors. Of note, younger women (≤ 40) placed greater importance on the ability to have children after the procedure. CONCLUSION: Information regarding the factors most and least important to patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids might inform development and regulatory evaluation of new technologies and procedures. Study results may be useful in efforts to develop a set of outcomes to include in future fibroids clinical studies.",1
Patient-Centered Quality Measures for Dialysis Care: A Report of a Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Scientific Workshop Sponsored by the National Kidney Foundation.,"Providing high-quality patient-centered care is the central mission of dialysis facilities. Assessing quality and patient-centeredness of dialysis care is necessary for continuous dialysis facility improvement. Based predominantly on readily measured items, current quality measures in dialysis care emphasize biochemical and utilization outcomes, with very few patient-reported items. Additionally, current metrics often do not account for patient preferences and may compromise patient-centered care by limiting the ability of providers to individualize care targets, such as dialysis adequacy, based on patient priorities rather than a fixed numerical target. Developing, implementing, and maintaining a quality program using readily quantifiable data while also allowing for individualization of care targets that emphasize the goals of patients and their care partners provided the motivation for a September 2022 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Workshop on Patient-Centered Quality Measures for Dialysis Care. Workshop participants focused on 4 questions: (1) What are the outcomes that are most important to patients and their care partners? (2) How can social determinants of health be accounted for in quality measures? (3) How can individualized care be effectively addressed in population-level quality programs? (4) What are the optimal means for collecting valid and robust patient-reported outcome data? Workshop participants identified numerous gaps within the current quality system and favored a conceptually broader, but not larger, quality system that stresses highly meaningful and adaptive measures that incorporate patient-centered principles, individual life goals, and social risk factors. Workshop participants also identified a need for new, low-burden tools to assess patient goals and priorities.",0
Centering patient perspectives to achieve injury-related health equity in trauma care systems: Improving trauma registry data.,"BACKGROUND: Limitations in current data collection systems for patients who experience traumatic injury limit researchers' ability to identify and address disparities in injury and outcomes. We sought to develop and test a patient-centered data-collection system for equity-related data indicators that was acceptable to racially and ethnically diverse patients being treated for traumatic injuries. METHODS: Health equity indicators included in this study were race and ethnicity, language, education, employment, housing, and injury address. We conducted interviews with 245 racially and ethnically diverse trauma patients who were treated at a level-1 trauma center in the US in 2019-2020. We first interviewed 136 patients to develop a culturally resonant process and options for the health equity indicators to be added to a revised data collection system for the electronic medical record. English and Spanish interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim; qualitative analysis was used to assess patient preferences. We then pilot tested the revised data collection system with an additional 109 trauma patients to assess acceptability. Acceptability was defined as having more than 95% of participants self-identify with one of the proposed options for race/ethnicity, language, education, employment, and housing. Injury address (to identify geographic disparities) was pre-defined as acceptable if at least 85% of participants could identify exact address, cross streets, a landmark or business, or zip code of injury. RESULTS: A revised data collection system, including culturally resonant indicators and a process to be used by patient registrars to collect health equity data, was pilot tested, refined, and considered acceptable. Culturally resonant question phrasing/answer options for race/ethnicity, language, education, employment, housing status, and injury address were identified as acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a patient-centered data collection system for health equity measures with racially and ethnically diverse patients who have experienced traumatic injury. This system has the potential to increase data quality and accuracy, which is critical to quality improvement efforts and for researchers seeking to identify groups most impacted by racism and other structural barriers to equitable health outcomes and effective intervention points.",0
Satisfaction and preferences among patients with both implant-supported single crown and tooth-supported fixed dental prosthesis: a pilot study.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess patient-reported preferences and outcomes in patients rehabilitated with both an implant-supported single crown (ISC) and a tooth-supported fixed dental prosthesis (FDP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The electronic journal system at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Oslo, was searched to find patients presenting both an ISC and an FDP replacing no more than two teeth between abutments. Identified patients that agreed answered a questionnaire followed by a clinical examination. Descriptive statistics was calculated. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included. The mean function time was 11.8 years for FDPs and 6.6 years for ISCs. All but three patients were satisfied with both rehabilitation modalities. No patients were unsatisfied with aesthetics or function of either rehabilitation. All patients reported satisfactory function of their restorations and reported chewing without problems. The self-reported post-operative complications were few, but less than observed in the clinical examinations. CONCLUSIONS: More patients reported food impaction with their FDP as compared to their ISC. Function and aesthetics of FDPs and ISCs were rated similarly, but more patients found the ISC treatment more uncomfortable. Despite this finding, most patients would prefer to undergo ISC treatment if they were to replace another missing tooth.",0
Preoperative Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging: An Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario) Clinical Practice Guideline.,"BACKGROUND: The use of preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after the diagnosis of breast cancer by mammography and/or ultrasound is inconsistent. METHODS: After conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing preoperative breast MRI versus no MRI, we reconvened to prepare a clinical practice guideline on this topic. RESULTS: Based on the evidence that MRI improved recurrence, decreased the rates of reoperations (re-excisions or conversion mastectomy), and increased detection of synchronous contralateral breast cancer, we recommend that preoperative breast MRI should be considered on a case-by-case basis in patients diagnosed with breast cancer for whom additional information about disease extent could influence treatment. Based on stronger evidence, preoperative breast MRI is recommended in patients diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma for whom additional information about disease extent could influence treatment. For both recommendations, the decision to proceed with MRI would be conditional on shared decision-making between care providers and the patient, taking into account the benefits and risks of MRI as well as patient preferences. Based on the opinion of the Working Group, preoperative breast MRI is also recommended in the following more specific situations: (a) to aid in surgical planning of breast conserving surgery in patients with suspected or known multicentric or multifocal disease; (b) to identify additional lesions in patients with dense breasts; (c) to determine the presence of pectoralis major muscle/chest wall invasion in patients with posteriorly located tumours or when invasion of the pectoralis major muscle or chest wall is suspected; (d) to aid in surgical planning for skin/nipple-sparing mastectomies, autologous reconstruction, oncoplastic surgery, and breast conserving surgery with suspected nipple/areolar involvement; and (e) in patients with familial/hereditary breast cancer but who have not had recent breast MRI as part of screening or diagnosis.",0
"A Randomized, Prospective, Observer-Masked Study Comparing Dropless Treatment Regimen Using Intracanalicular Dexamethasone Insert, Intracameral Ketorolac, and Intracameral Moxifloxacin versus Conventional Topical Therapy to Control Postoperative Pain and ","PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical efficacy and patient preference for a dropless treatment regimen compared to conventional topical therapy in patients undergoing cataract surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective, contralateral eye study, patients with bilateral cataract were randomized to receive either intracanalicular dexamethasone insert, intracameral phenylephrine 1%/ketorolac 0.3%, and intracameral moxifloxacin (50 µg) (study group) or topical moxifloxacin 0.5%, ketorolac 0.5%, and prednisolone acetate 1.0% QID (control group). The second eye underwent cataract surgery 2 weeks later and was treated with the opposite treatment. All patients were evaluated at Days 1, 7, 14, 28, and 3 months. The primary outcome measure was postoperative ocular pain. Secondary outcomes included summed ocular inflammation score (SOIS; the sum of the mean anterior chamber cells and anterior flare score), the patient preference for medication protocol between the two eyes, and patient out-of-pocket cost of medications. Safety outcome measures included CDVA, intraocular pressure, central retinal thickness (CRT), and the incidence of reported AEs. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with no pain was similar in both groups at all postoperative visits (p>0.05). No statistically significant difference in SOIS score was observed between the two groups at any visit. A strong majority of the patients (94.7%) preferred the study eye's dropless regimen over the control eye's conventional topical therapy regimen. No statistically significant difference in mean intraocular pressure (IOP) was observed at any postoperative visit, except at Week 1. The mean CDVA was also similar in both groups at all postoperative visits (p>0.05). The postoperative mean CRT was comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION: A dropless treatment regimen is as effective as topical eyedrop administration. A higher proportion of patients who underwent bilateral cataract surgery preferred the dropless treatment regimen over the patient-administered eye drop regimen.",0
The art of diabetes care: guidelines for a holistic approach to human and social factors.,"A holistic approach to diabetes considers patient preferences, emotional health, living conditions, and other contextual factors, in addition to medication selection. Human and social factors influence treatment adherence and clinical outcomes. Social issues, cost of care, out-of-pocket expenses, pill burden (number and frequency), and injectable drugs such as insulin, can affect adherence. Clinicians can ask about these contextual factors when discussing treatment options with patients. Patients' emotional health can also affect diabetes self-care. Social stressors such as family issues may impair self-care behaviors. Diabetes can also lead to emotional stress. Diabetes distress correlates with worse glycemic control and lower overall well-being. Patient-centered communication can build the foundation of a trusting relationship with the clinician. Respect for patient preferences and fears can build trust. Relevant communication skills include asking open-ended questions, expressing empathy, active listening, and exploring the patient's perspective. Glycemic goals must be personalized based on frailty, the risk of hypoglycemia, and healthy life expectancy. Lifestyle counseling requires a nonjudgmental approach and tactfulness. The art of diabetes care rests on clinicians perceiving a patient's emotional state. Tailoring the level of advice and diabetes targets based on a patient's personal and contextual factors requires mindfulness by clinicians.",0
Designing Clinical MRI for Enhanced Workflow and Value.,"MRI is an expensive and traditionally time-intensive modality in imaging. With the paradigm shift toward value-based healthcare, radiology departments must examine the entire MRI process cycle to identify opportunities to optimize efficiency and enhance value for patients. Digital tools such as ""frictionless scheduling"" prioritize patient preference and convenience, thereby delivering patient-centered care. Recent advances in conventional and deep learning-based accelerated image reconstruction methods have reduced image acquisition time to such a degree that so-called nongradient time now constitutes a major percentage of total room time. For this reason, architectural design strategies that reconfigure patient preparation processes and decrease the turnaround time between scans can substantially impact overall throughput while also improving patient comfort and privacy. Real-time informatics tools that provide an enterprise-wide overview of MRI workflow and Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS)-integrated instant messaging can complement these efforts by offering transparent, situational data and facilitating communication between radiology team members. Finally, long-term investment in training, recruiting, and retaining a highly skilled technologist workforce is essential for building a pipeline and team of technologists committed to excellence. Here, we highlight various opportunities for optimizing MRI workflow and enhancing value by offering many of our own on-the-ground experiences and conclude by anticipating some of the future directions for process improvement and innovation in clinical MR imaging. EVIDENCE LEVEL: N/A TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 1.",0
"Completing the time trade-off with respondents who are older, in poorer health or with an immigrant background in an EQ-5D-5L valuation study.","OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of age, immigrant background, and poor self-reported health in a general population sample on the probability of non-completion or slow completion of the time trade-off (TTO). METHODS: We used data from an interrupted Norwegian EQ-5D-5L valuation study conducted between 2019 and 2020. All participants responded to background items, irrespective of completion. We used mixed effect logistic regression analysis to assess the effect of old age, poor health, and immigrant background on the probability of non-completion of the TTO, and, for those who completed the TTO, of slow completion times. RESULTS: First experiences from a Norwegian valuation study were that 29 (5.5%) respondents failed to complete the TTO tasks. For those reporting age over 65 years, poor health, or an immigrant background, 12% failed to complete the TTO. Adjusted odds ratios for predictors of non-completion were statistically significant (age > 65 years, 8.3; EQ-VAS ≤ 50, 3.49; immigrant background, 4.56). Being over 65 years or with an immigrant background also predicted slow completion of both the introduction and TTO tasks. CONCLUSIONS: High age, poor health, and immigrant status increased the risk of not being able to complete the TTO tasks, and of slow completion. Higher non-completion rates and increased completion times suggest that elements of the TTO may be demanding for some respondent groups, with possible implications for representativeness.",0
Eligibility test for advanced chronic kidney disease: Revision and proposal.,"Nowadays, chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence keeps increasing worldwide. The management of these patients usually requires renal replacement therapy (RRT). However, the complexity of patients' profiles comprises a great challenge to overcome. During the last decades, CKD units have been developed to offer multidisciplinary and coordinated attention to patients, helping in the decision-making of the RRT. Nevertheless, there is a huge variability in the performance and organization of care practice, implying an existing necessity to homogenize the RRT modality chosen. We propose a test composed of two parts: one to be completed by the medical staff (to evaluate contraindications for the different RRT techniques) and another by the patient or nursing staff (to consider patients' preferences). In this sense, it would be possible to have a common and useful tool to complement patient education in RRT, as well as sharing decision-making in the ACKD units taking into account patient preferences.",0
Patient Portal Privacy: Perspectives of Adolescents and Emerging Adults Living with HIV and the Parental/Guardian Role in Supporting Their Care.,"BACKGROUND: Increasing the percentage of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), including youth, who are virally suppressed to 95% is an overall goal of the ending the HIV epidemic initiative. While patient portals have become ubiquitous, questions remain about how best to operationalize parental/guardian access to youth's patient portals in alignment with optimizing HIV care outcomes and patient preferences. This qualitative study focuses on understanding perspectives among youth with HIV (YHIV) about parental access to patient portals. METHODS: Eligible participants were YHIV aged 13 to 25 years receiving care at an urban academic hospital. Semistructured individual/paired interviews were conducted between May 2022 and March 2023. Participants were asked to discuss thoughts on parental access to patient portals, and roles parents/guardians have in supporting their HIV care. Semistructured interviews were conducted with adolescent and emerging adult health care workers (HCWs) to gain perspectives on YHIV emergent themes. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim, and we conducted thematic analysis using an inductive approach to identify codes and themes. RESULTS: Sixteen YHIV and four HCWs participated in interviews. Parental roles in coordinating HIV care ranged from supporting YHIV needs for transportation, acquiring, and taking medications, to not having any role at all. Participants shared heterogeneous perspectives about their openness to share patient portal access with their parents/guardians. Perspectives were not strictly congruent along lines of participant age or parental roles in helping youth to manage HIV care. Sharing passwords emerged both as a pathway that YHIV grant access to their accounts and a source of confusion for clinicians when parents/guardians send messages using their child's account. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest HCWs should initiate conversations with YHIV patients to determine preferences for parental/guardian access to their patient portal, educate on proxy access, and explain the extent of medical information that is shared with proxy accounts, regardless of age and perceived parental involvement in HIV care.",0
Determining patient preferences in the treatment of medication-refractory overactive bladder.,"INTRODUCTION: Overactive bladder (OAB) is often suboptimally addressed by behavioral or pharmacological treatments. Less than 15% of patients choose to pursue advanced OAB therapy (sacral nerve stimulation [SNS], percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation [PTNS], and bladder onabotulinum toxin type-A [BTX-A]). We seek to better understand which factors are most important to patients when choosing a third-line therapy. METHODS/MATERIALS: We developed a conjoint analysis survey that included five attributes of the third-line options for OAB (SNS, PTNS, and BTX-A). We administered the survey to new patients with urinary incontinence at two institutions. A hierarchical Bayes random effects regression analysis was used to determine the relative importance of the attributes. A choice simulator was used to model which third-line treatment options patients preferred. We followed patients to see if they pursued their predicted treatment. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients completed the study of whom 89% were women. There was representation from all age groups. The most important attributes of decision-making were the frequency of future procedures, the risk of catheterization, and the need for a device. On market simulation, SNS was the preferred treatment option (47%), followed by PTNS (29%) and BTX-A (14%). Only 10% of patients did not find any treatment option acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent follow-up, risk of catheterization, and the need for a device were the most important attributes when making a decision on third-line OAB therapy. On market simulation, SNS is the preferred treatment for all age groups though the ultimate choice in third-line therapy may be affected by external factors.",1
Do the Few Dictate Care for the Many? Revascularisation Considerations That Go Beyond the Guidelines.,"The burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) is large and growing, commonly presenting with comorbidities and older age. Patients may benefit from coronary revascularisation with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), yet half of patients with CAD who would benefit from revascularisation fall outside the eligibility criteria of trials to date. As such, the choice of revascularisation procedures varies depending on the CAD anatomy and complexity, surgical risk and comorbidities, the patient's preferences and values, and the treating team's expertise. The recent American guidelines on coronary revascularisation are comprehensive in describing recommendations for PCI, CABG, or conservative management in patients with CAD. However, individual challenging patient presentations cannot be fully captured in guidelines. The aim of this narrative review is to summarise common clinical scenarios that are not sufficiently described by contemporary clinical guidelines and trials in order to inform heart team members and trainees about the nuanced considerations and available evidence to manage such cases. We discuss clinical cases that fall beyond the current guidelines and summarise the relevant evidence evaluating coronary revascularisation for these patients. In addition, we highlight gaps in knowledge based on a lack of research (eg, ineligibility of certain patient populations), underrepresentation in research (eg, underenrollment of female and non-White patients), and the surge in newer minimally invasive and hybrid techniques. We argue that ultimately, evidence-based medicine, patient preference, shared decision making, and effective heart team communications are necessary to best manage complex CAD presentations potentially benefitting from revascularisation with CABG or PCI.",0
Peer Support in Rheumatic Diseases: A Narrative Literature Review.,"Rheumatic diseases are a group of chronic conditions that are associated with significant morbidity, impaired physical function, psychosocial stress, and cost to the healthcare system. Peer support interventions have been shown to have a positive impact on health outcomes in several chronic conditions, but no review has specifically assessed the impact of peer support on rheumatic conditions. The aim of this narrative literature review was to understand how peer support has been applied in the field of rheumatology, with a specific focus on the impact of observational and randomized studies of direct peer support interventions on various outcome measures across rheumatic conditions. We also examined studies exploring patient attitudes and preferences toward peer support. The majority of studies included focused on peer support in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Generally, patients across the spectrum of rheumatic disease perceive peer support as a useful tool. Peer support interventions, while highly variable, were generally associated with positive impacts on health-related quality of life metrics (both perceived and measured), although these differences were not always statistically significant. Important limitations include variability in study design, selection bias among study participants, and short follow-up periods across most peer support interventions.",0
The relevance of fatigue to relapse rate in multiple sclerosis: Applying patient preference data to the OPTIMUM trial.,"BACKGROUND: In the OPTIMUM trial in patients with relapsing MS, treatment differences in annualized relapse rate (ARR, 0.088) and change in fatigue at week 108 (3.57 points, measured using the Fatigue Symptoms and Impacts Questionnaire-Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis, symptom domain (FSIQ-RMS-S)) favored ponesimod over teriflunomide. However, the importance of the fatigue outcome to patients was unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the importance of the OPTIMUM FSIQ-RMS-S results using data from an MS discrete choice experiment (DCE). METHODS: The DCE included components to correlate levels of physical and cognitive fatigue with FSIQ-RMS-S scores. Changes in relapses/year and time to MS progression equivalent to the treatment difference in fatigue in OPTIMUM were determined for similar fatigue levels as mean baseline fatigue in OPTIMUM. RESULTS: DCE participants would accept 0.06 more relapses/year or a 0.15-0.17 year decrease in time to MS progression for a 3.57-point difference in physical fatigue on the FSIQ-RMS-S. To improve cognitive fatigue by 3.57-points on the FSIQ-RMS-S, DCE participants would accept 0.09-0.10 more relapses/year or a 0.24-0.28 year decrease in time to MS progression. CONCLUSION: MS patients would accept 0.06 more relapses/year to change their fatigue by a similar magnitude as the between-treatment difference observed in the OPTIMUM trial.",1
"Evaluation of Orthodontic Treatment Method Preferences of Dentistry Students, Dentists and Orthodontic Residents.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate orthodontic treatment method preferences among dentistry students, dentists and orthodontic residents taking into account factors such as esthetics, advantage/disadvantage, cost and treatment duration. METHODS: The study was carried out on three groups: dentistry students (n=318), dentists (n=110) and orthodontic residents (n=98), and a 17-question survey was applied. Questionnaire forms included informational photos of conventional metal brackets (CMB), esthetic ceramic brackets (ECB), self-ligating brackets (SLB), clear aligner (CA), and lingual brackets (LB). The participants' preferences for orthodontic treatment methods were evaluated using chi-square analysis, not only between groups but also considering gender and income level. RESULTS: Regarding esthetics, dentists (41%) and orthodontic residents (78%) mostly preferred CA, while dentistry students mostly preferred LB (44%). With regard to advantage/disadvantage, dentistry students (31%) and dentists (39%) mostly preferred SLB, while orthodontic residents mostly preferred CA (55%). Regarding the success of the treatment, all three groups mostly preferred CMB. (respectively 50%; 47%; 72%). While CA was mostly preferred for short-term treatments in all three groups (respectively 40%; 71%; 88%), CMB was mostly preferred for long-term treatments (respectively 35%, 51%, 55%). Gender and income-level differences had little effect on orthodontic treatment method preferences. CONCLUSION: Except for long-term treatments and treatment success, there was generally great interest in CA, especially among orthodontic residents. Ceramic brackets and LB were generally the least preferred treatment methods among dentistry students, dentists, and orthodontic residents.",0
A new very-small-bore Simmons guiding sheath for transradial neurointervention: Technical note and initial experience.,"Transradial access during neurointerventions has increased in popularity because of reduced complications and patient preference. Nevertheless, transradial cannulation into the left common carotid artery can be difficult technically because of the lack of catheter support in the aortic arch. Furthermore, the use of large sheaths can increase the risk of complications at the access site. Here, we developed a new very-small-bore transradial system using a 3F Simmons guiding sheath, to increase the procedural success rate and minimize access-site complications. This system can represent a valuable treatment option for neurointerventions and has the potential to expand the indications for transradial access.",0
Center Hemodialysis Versus Peritoneal Dialysis: A Cost-Utility Analysis.,"Introduction Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) is needed for patients with end-stage kidney disease. While it is clear that kidney transplantation remains the gold standard in KRT, data comparing the cost-utility of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) are scarce. No such analysis has been performed for German patients.  Methods We used aggregated data generated by the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) for quality of life and insurance claims to evaluate mortality and economic impact. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and cost-utility were calculated accordingly.  Results PD is superior to HD within all dimensions of the SF-36, both in terms of QALY and cost-utility. The difference in cost per QALY between the aggregated physical dimensions (€50,671.54 vs. €39,745.77) is greater than that of the aggregated mental dimensions (€31,638.75 vs. €25,287.63). However, there is considerable variability among patients.  Conclusion From a health-economic point of view, PD should be preferred over HD when deciding on the KRT modality for the patient. This is not reflected in current practice, though. However, interindividual differences and patient preferences should be considered in the decision.",0
"European guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of breast lesions with uncertain malignant potential (B3 lesions) developed jointly by EUSOMA, EUSOBI, ESP (BWG) and ESSO.","INTRODUCTION: Breast lesions of uncertain malignant potential (B3) include atypical ductal and lobular hyperplasias, lobular carcinoma in situ, flat epithelial atypia, papillary lesions, radial scars and fibroepithelial lesions as well as other rare miscellaneous lesions. They are challenging to categorise histologically, requiring specialist training and multidisciplinary input. They may coexist with in situ or invasive breast cancer (BC) and increase the risk of subsequent BC development. Management should focus on adequate classification and management whilst avoiding overtreatment. The aim of these guidelines is to provide updated information regarding the diagnosis and management of B3 lesions, according to updated literature review evidence. METHODS: These guidelines provide practical recommendations which can be applied in clinical practice which include recommendation grade and level of evidence. All sections were written according to an updated literature review and discussed at a consensus meeting. Critical appraisal by the expert writing committee adhered to the 23 items in the international Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) tool. RESULTS: Recommendations for further management after core-needle biopsy (CNB) or vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) diagnosis of a B3 lesion reported in this guideline, vary depending on the presence of atypia, size of lesion, sampling size, and patient preferences. After CNB or VAB, the option of vacuum-assisted excision or surgical excision should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team and shared decision-making with the patient is crucial for personalizing further treatment. De-escalation of surgical intervention for B3 breast lesions is ongoing, and the inclusion of vacuum-assisted excision (VAE) will decrease the need for surgical intervention in further approaches. Communication with patients may be different according to histological diagnosis, presence or absence of atypia, or risk of upgrade due to discordant imaging. Written information resources to help patients understand these issues alongside with verbal communication is recommended. Lifestyle interventions have a significant impact on BC incidence so lifestyle interventions need to be suggested to women at increased BC risk as a result of a diagnosis of a B3 lesion. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide a state-of-the-art overview of the diagnosis, management and prognosis of B3 lesions in modern multidisciplinary breast practice.",0
Nurses' Perceived Effects of Visitor Restrictions in Hospital Maternity Units.,"PURPOSE: To explore how perinatal nurses perceive the effects of visitor restrictions on patient care within a hospital setting. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We distributed a cross-sectional survey online to perinatal nurses in May of 2022. Characteristics of respondents were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Responses to an open-ended question were analyzed via conventional content analysis. RESULTS: Among our sample of 101 nurses, we identified seven codes representing positive effects and seven codes representing negative effects. The most frequently reported positive effects were ability to provide person-centered care (n = 36, 35.6%) and less patient stress and more rest (n = 29, 28.7%). The most frequently reported negative effects were limited patient support (n = 22, 21.8%) and emotional distress to the patient (n = 15, 14.9%). Fourteen percent (n = 14) of respondents cited both positive and negative effects. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Nurses perceived that visitor restrictions resulted in both positive and negative patient experiences. Balancing clinical needs and safety considerations with emotional needs of the childbearing individual requires careful consideration by maternity care clinicians and health care systems. Subsequent research is needed to determine optimal visitation policies during intrapartum and postpartum with consideration to hospital context and patient preferences for optimal care.",0

Usual Source of Care and Contraceptive Use.,"BACKGROUND: A high proportion of people in the United States at risk of unintended pregnancy also have limited primary care access. STUDY DESIGN: We pooled data for analyses from separate 2015-2017 and 2017-2019 waves of the National Survey of Family Growth. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate associations between the usual source of health care and self-reported use of a comprehensive range of contraceptive options, as well as alignment between patient preference and the current method. RESULTS: Compared with having a private doctor or Health Maintenance Organization, not having a usual source of care was associated with lower odds of using short-term hormonal methods (OR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.40-0.73, for an 11 percentage point lower rate); higher odds of using time-based methods (OR=1.47, 95% CI: 1.10-1.97, for a 6 percentage point higher rate); and higher odds of preferring a contraceptive method other than the one most recently used (OR=1.39, 95% CI: 1.01-1.90, for a 6 percentage point higher probability). Reliance on an emergency department as a usual source of care was not associated with contraceptive use or satisfaction with the method used. Reliance on urgent care was associated only with higher odds of using time-based methods (OR=1.60, 95% CI: 1.03-2.50, for a 7 percentage point higher rate). Clinic-based usual care was not associated with any differences in contraceptive use but was associated with preferring a contraceptive method other than the one most recently used (OR=1.65, 95% CI: 1.21-2.25, for an 8 percentage point higher probability). CONCLUSIONS: All sources of usual care can improve contraceptive access.",0

National trends in osteoporosis medication use among Medicare beneficiaries with and without Alzheimer's disease/related dementias.,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporotic fractures  are a leading cause of disability and premature death in the elderly. Patients with Alzheimer's and related dementia (ADRD) have high rates of osteoporosis (OP) and substantial risk of osteoporotic fractures. Yet research is sparse on trends and predictors of OP medication use in ADRD. METHODS: Medicare beneficiaries with OP aged ≥ 67 years have Medicare parts A/B/D without HMO from 2016 to 2018. Our outcome was receipt of OP medications in 2018. A multivariable logistic regression assessed association between ADRD and OP drug prescribing, adjusted for age, sex, race, region, Medicare entitlement, dual Medicaid eligibility, chronic conditions, number of provider visits/hospitalizations, and nursing home (NH) resident status. Age/ADRD and NH residency/ADRD interactions were tested. RESULTS: Our sample consisted of 47,871 people with OP and ADRD and 201,840 with OP without ADRD. OP drug use was 38.6% in ADRD patients vs. 52.7% in non-ADRD. After adjustment for demographics, chronic conditions, and previous hospitalizations/physician visits, the OR for OP drug in ADRD vs. non-ADRD was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.83-0.87). NH residents had lower odds for OP medication (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.58-0.64). There were significant interactions between ADRD and age, and between ADRD and NH residency. The OR for OP drug use associated with ADRD was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86-0.90) among community-dwelling elders and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.64-0.69) among NH residents. CONCLUSIONS: ADRD patients received OP drugs at a lower rate than their non-ADRD counterparts. More research is needed on when to prescribe or deprescribe OP drugs in the context of different ADRD severity, patient preferences, remaining life expectancy, and time-to-benefit from OP drugs.",0
The Place of Immune Reconstitution Therapy in the Management of Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis in France: An Expert Consensus.,"The treatment strategy in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) is a complex decision requiring individualization of treatment sequences to maximize clinical outcomes. Current local and international guidelines do not provide specific recommendation on the use of immune reconstitution therapy (IRT) as alternative to continuous immunosuppression in the management of RMS. The objective of the program was to provide consensus-based expert opinion on the optimal use of IRT in the management of RMS. A Delphi method was performed from May 2022 to July 2022. Nineteen clinical assertions were developed by a scientific committee and sent to 14 French clinical experts in MS alongside published literature. Two consecutive reproducible anonymous votes were conducted. Consensus on recommendations was achieved when more than 75% of the respondents agreed or disagreed with the clinical assertions. After the second round, consensus was achieved amongst 16 out of 19 propositions: 13 clinical assertions had a 100% consensus, 3 clinical assertions a consensus above 75% and 3 without consensus. Expert-agreed consensus is provided on topics related to the benefit of the early use of IRT from immunological and clinical perspectives, profiles of patients who may benefit most from the IRT strategy (e.g. patients with family planning, patient preference and lifestyle requirements). These French expert consensuses provide up-to-date relevant guidance on the use of IRT in clinical practice. The current program reflects status of knowledge in 2022 and should be updated in timely manner when further clinical data in IRT become available.",0
Atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation in patients hospitalised for stroke in the REGIONS Care Study.,"AIM: To describe atrial fibrillation (AF) patient characteristics and anticoagulation patterns in stroke patients in Aotearoa. METHODS: Reducing Ethnic and Geographic Inequities to Optimise New Zealand Stroke (REGIONS) Care study is a prospective, nation-wide observational study of consecutive adult stroke patients admitted to hospital between 1 May and 31 October 2018. AF and anticoagulation prescribing, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and differences by Māori ethnicity and hospital location are described. RESULTS: Of 2,379 patients, 807 (34.3%) had a diagnosis of AF. AF patients were older than non-AF patients (mean 79.9 [SD 11] versus 72.5 [14.2], p<0.0001). AF was diagnosed before stroke in 666 patients (82.5%), of whom 442 (66.4%) were taking an anticoagulant. The most common documented reasons for non-anticoagulation were prior bleeding (20.5%), patient preference (18.1%), frailty, comorbidities/side effects (13.2%) and falls (6.8%). The ICH rate was similar for AF patients on versus not on an anticoagulant (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-1.80). Rates and reasons for oral anticoagulant non-prescribing were similar for Māori, non-Māori, urban and non-urban populations. CONCLUSIONS: Although anticoagulation prescribing in AF has improved, one third of stroke patients with known AF were not taking an anticoagulant prior to admission and the majority did not appear to have an absolute contraindication offering a multidisciplinary opportunity for improvement. There were no significant differences for Māori and non-urban populations in anticoagulant prescribing.",0
Relugolix in Clinical Practice: The Best Route for All?,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been a mainstay of prostate cancer treatment for decades. Relugolix was FDA-approved in 2020 and is currently the only ADT option via an oral route. While the opportunity to use an oral medication for this indication has some advantages, a balanced discussion is required to understand in what clinical settings this agent truly has benefit over long-acting injectable formulations of ADT. Furthermore, patient preference, compliance, financial toxicity, and perhaps most importantly, pharmacologic characteristics must be considered.",0

Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (ESG) Versus Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (LSG): A Comparative Review.,"Obesity is one of the most debilitating conditions. In a quest to mitigate disease severity, various interventions have been proposed, with endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) and laparoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (LSG) being among the recent interventions that have received growing attention. This systematic review sought to conduct a comparative analysis regarding the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of both interventions. The study involved a systematic review in which key search engines were used to select articles documented and published in the last decade. The articles for inclusion were those existing as peer-reviewed studies touching upon the aforementioned subject, with both controlled and uncontrolled trials included. Furthermore, there was the implementation of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol that governs systematic reviews, in which the article selection process entailed four key procedures in the form of identification, screening, determining eligibility, and the inclusion process. In the findings, the selected articles documented mixed outcomes, but a common denominator was that the safety profile of ESG tends to be superior to that of LSG due to the observations that ESG comes with fewer adverse events such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and severe nausea and vomiting. However, the majority of the studies contended that LSG proved superior to ESG in terms of effectiveness and efficacy. Hence, individuals with mild-to-moderate obesity are more likely to benefit from ESG, but those with severe obesity whose goal is to achieve long-term weight management might benefit more from LSG. In conclusion, the management of obesity and the decision to employ ESG or LSG ought to be patient-centered and dictated by factors such as patient preferences, safety, and the sustainability of the devised plan of care.",0
Factors Affecting Recurrence of Idiopathic Granulomatous Mastitis: A Systematic Review.,"Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is a rare and benign disease that primarily affects young women of reproductive age. Various factors have been suggested as possible causes, including pregnancy, breastfeeding, history of taking birth control pills, hyperprolactinemia, smoking, and history of trauma. Due to unknown etiology, opinions on its treatment have varied, resulting in differing recurrence rates and side effects. Therefore, conducting a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis can aid in understanding the causes and recurrence of the disease, thereby assisting in the selection of effective treatment and improving the quality of life. A systematic literature review was conducted using predefined search terms to identify eligible studies related to risk factors and recurrence up to June 2022 from electronic databases. Data were extracted and subjected to meta-analysis when applicable. A total of 71 studies with 4735 patients were included. The mean age of the patients was 34.98 years, and the average mass size was 4.64 cm. About 3749 of these patients (79.17%) were Caucasian. Patients who mentioned a history of pregnancy were 92.65% with 76.57%, 22.7%, and 19.7% having a history of breastfeeding, taking contraceptive pills, and high prolactin levels, respectively. Around 5.6% of patients had previous trauma. The overall recurrence rate was 17.18%, with recurrence rates for treatments as follows: surgery (22.5%), immunosuppressive treatment (14.7%), combined treatment (14.9%), antibiotic treatment (6.74%), and observation (9.4%). Only antibiotic and expectant treatments had significant differences in recurrence rates compared to other treatments (p value = 0.023). In conclusion, factors such as Caucasian race, pregnancy and breastfeeding history, and use of contraceptive hormone are commonly associated with the disease recurrence. Treatment should be tailored based on symptom severity and patient preference, with surgery or immunosuppressive options for recurrence.",0
Selecting Optimal First-Line Treatment for Microsatellite Stable and Non-Mutated RAS/BRAF Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.,"Standard frontline treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is cytotoxic chemotherapy plus a biologic agent such as an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (cetuximab or panitumumab) or anti-VEGF antibody (bevacizumab). Predictive biomarkers include mismatch repair (MMR) status, and RAS and BRAF mutation status; and important factors in treatment selection include primary tumor location, intent of therapy, and potential toxicity, as well as patient age, comorbidities, and patient preference. To date, single-, double-, or triple-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy all have important roles in appropriately selected patients, with the addition of anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR antibody therapy based on the relevant predictive biomarker. Data indicate that patients with proficient MMR, RAS/BRAF wt mCRC are candidates for an anti-EGFR antibody plus doublet chemotherapy if they have a left-sided primary tumor, or for anti-VEGF (bevacizumab) plus doublet or triplet chemotherapy if they have a right-sided primary tumor. Future studies may provide more predictive biomarkers to further personalize therapy for this heterogeneous disease.",0
Advance Directives.,"Advance directives are legal documents that outline an individual's preferences regarding major medical decisions. These directives specify the healthcare options that an individual desires or rejects, currently and in the future. In addition, advance directives designate one or more individuals who will act as spokespersons on behalf of the patient if they become unable to communicate their preferences. There are variations in advance directive laws from state to state. Several states have implemented specific forms of advance directives, such as Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST), Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST), Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment (MOST), Physician Orders for Scope of Treatment (POST), Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) Order/Clinician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (COLST), Transportable Physician Orders for Patient Preferences (TPOPP), or similar directives have been introduced. These forms condense the essential elements of an advance directive into a medical order format. To maintain brevity, the term ""POLST"" will be applied to encompass all the variations above in the remainder of this article.",0
SEOM-GEMCAD-TTD clinical guidelines for the systemic treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (2022).,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in Spain. Metastatic disease is present in 15-30% of patients at diagnosis and up to 20-50% of those with initially localized disease eventually develop metastases. Recent scientific knowledge acknowledges that this is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous disease. As treatment options increase, prognosis for individuals with metastatic disease has steadily improved over recent decades. Disease management should be discussed among experienced, multidisciplinary teams to select the most appropriate systemic treatment (chemotherapy and targeted agents) and to integrate surgical or ablative procedures, when indicated. Clinical presentation, tumor sidedness, molecular profile, disease extension, comorbidities, and patient preferences are key factors when designing a customized treatment plan. These guidelines seek to provide succinct recommendations for managing metastatic CRC.",0
Quantifying the association of individual-level characteristics with disparities in kidney transplant waitlist addition among people with HIV.,"BACKGROUND: Over 45% of people with HIV (PWH) in the United States at least 50 years old and are at heightened risk of aging-related comorbidities including end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), for which kidney transplant is the optimal treatment. Among ESKD patients, PWH have lower likelihood of waitlisting, a requisite step in the transplant process, than individuals without HIV. It is unknown what proportion of the inequity by HIV status can be explained by demographics, medical characteristics, substance use history, and geography. METHODS: The United States Renal Data System, a national database of all individuals ESKD, was used to create a cohort of people with and without HIV through Medicare claims linkage (2007-2017). The primary outcome was waitlisting. Inverse odds ratio weighting was conducted to assess what proportion of the disparity by HIV status could be explained by individual characteristics. RESULTS: Six thousand two hundred and fifty PWH were significantly younger at ESKD diagnosis and more commonly Black with fewer comorbidities. PWH were more frequently characterized as using tobacco, alcohol and drugs. Positive HIV-status was associated with 57% lower likelihood of waitlisting [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46-0.48, P  < 0.001]. Controlling for demographics, medical characteristics, substance use and geography explained 39.8% of this observed disparity (aHR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.59-0.79, P  < 0.001). CONCLUSION: PWH were significantly less likely to be waitlisted, and 60.2% of that disparity remained unexplained. HIV characteristics such as CD4 + counts, viral loads, antiretroviral therapy adherence, as well as patient preferences and provider decision-making warrant further study.",0
Recent advances and controversial issues in the optimal management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis.,"OBJECTIVE: The optimal management of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (AsxCS) is enduringly controversial. We updated our 2021 Expert Review and Position Statement, focusing on recent advances in the diagnosis and management of patients with AsxCS. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed up to August 1, 2023, using PubMed/PubMed Central, EMBASE and Scopus. The following keywords were used in various combinations: ""asymptomatic carotid stenosis,"" ""carotid endarterectomy"" (CEA), ""carotid artery stenting"" (CAS), and ""transcarotid artery revascularization"" (TCAR). Areas covered included (i) improvements in best medical treatment (BMT) for patients with AsxCS and declining stroke risk, (ii) technological advances in surgical/endovascular skills/techniques and outcomes, (iii) risk factors, clinical/imaging characteristics and risk prediction models for the identification of high-risk AsxCS patient subgroups, and (iv) the association between cognitive dysfunction and AsxCS. RESULTS: BMT is essential for all patients with AsxCS, regardless of whether they will eventually be offered CEA, CAS, or TCAR. Specific patient subgroups at high risk for stroke despite BMT should be considered for a carotid revascularization procedure. These patients include those with severe (≥80%) AsxCS, transcranial Doppler-detected microemboli, plaque echolucency on Duplex ultrasound examination, silent infarcts on brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography scans, decreased cerebrovascular reserve, increased size of juxtaluminal hypoechoic area, AsxCS progression, carotid plaque ulceration, and intraplaque hemorrhage. Treatment of patients with AsxCS should be individualized, taking into consideration individual patient preferences and needs, clinical and imaging characteristics, and cultural, ethnic, and social factors. Solid evidence supporting or refuting an association between AsxCS and cognitive dysfunction is lacking. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal management of patients with AsxCS should include BMT for all individuals and a prophylactic carotid revascularization procedure (CEA, CAS, or TCAR) for some asymptomatic patient subgroups, additionally taking into consideration individual patient needs and preference, clinical and imaging characteristics, social and cultural factors, and the available stroke risk prediction models. Future studies should investigate the association between AsxCS with cognitive function and the role of carotid revascularization procedures in the progression or reversal of cognitive dysfunction.",0
Shared decision making in the treatment of multiple sclerosis: A consensus based on Delphi methodology.,"Shared decision making is a way of incorporating patients' preferences and values into the decisions regarding the treatment and follow-up plan for the condition that affects them. It is currently applied mainly in the context of chronic disorders for which there is no cure available but nevertheless many therapeutic alternatives, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Current views and opinions on shared decision making for the treatment of MS are discussed in this consensus based on a modified Delphi method that included a group of neurologists from Argentina. A set of statements was defined by the experts and seeks to serve as a guide to apply this concept in clinical practice.",0
