Preferences for disease-related information and transitional skills among adolescents with congenital heart disease in the early transitional stage.,"PURPOSE: The transition towards adult-focused healthcare comprises a complex process requiring careful, individualized guidance of adolescents with congenital heart disease (CHD). Detailed data on their preferences regarding disease-related information and acquirable transitional skills are mostly lacking. We examined the preferences of CHD adolescents in the early transition stage. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed with adolescents recruited from a transition program. Two questionnaires assessing needs for information and transitional skills were used. Only questionnaires completed in the early transition stage were included. RESULTS: Forty-nine adolescents participated (mean age 15.9 ± 1.2 years, 43% girls). 59% requested information about their heart and previous and/or future surgeries/interventions, 45% about sports and medication, and a maximum of 27% about psychosocial topics. More girls than boys requested surgical information (76% versus 46%; p = 0.04). Adolescents with severely complex CHD more often requested information about medication than those with moderately complex CHD (63% versus 28%; p = 0.02). Older adolescents were less likely to request surgical information (OR = 0.53; 95%CI [0.26-0.88]; p = 0.03). Up to 83% of the adolescents perceived their skills as insufficient, but less than 14% was interested in acquiring skills.    Conclusion: Adolescents were mainly interested in medical topics, followed by lifestyle information. The informational needs tended to decrease with age. Timely gauging individual needs and delivering information, ideally in the early teens, appear important when providing person-tailored transitional care in CHD. Paradoxically, although the transitional skills were low-perceived, there was limited motivation to improve them. This paradox requires further investigation to better tailor transition interventions.     Clinical trial registration: Not applicable. WHAT IS KNOWN: • Transition towards adult life and care requires careful patient guidance. A person-tailored approach is strongly encouraged. However, details on preferences regarding disease-related information and transitional skills are scarce in adolescents with CHD. WHAT IS NEW: • This study showed that adolescents with CHD in early transition mainly need medical-related information. Their informational needs tend to decrease with age necessitating timely gauging for interest and delivering information. Adolescents report a low need to acquire transitional skills despite low self-esteemed skills levels.",0
Discrete Choice Experiments in Health State Valuation: A Systematic Review of Progress and New Trends.,"BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are increasingly used in health state valuation studies. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review updates the progress and new findings of DCE studies in the health state valuation, covering the period since the review of June 2018 to November 2022. The review reports the methods that are currently being used in DCE studies to value health and study design characteristics, and, for the first time, reviews DCE health state valuation studies published in the Chinese language. METHODS: English language databases PubMed and Cochrane, and Chinese language databases Wanfang and CNKI were searched using the self-developed search terms. Health state valuation or methodology study papers were included if the study used DCE data to generate a value set for a preference-based measure. Key information extracted included DCE study design strategies applied, methods for anchoring the latent coefficient on to a 0-1 QALY scale and data analysis methods. RESULTS: Sixty-five studies were included; one Chinese language publication and 64 English language publications. The number of health state valuation studies using DCE has rapidly increased in recent years and these have been conducted in more countries than prior to 2018. Wide usage of DCE with duration attributes, D-efficient design and models accounting for heterogeneity has continued in recent years. Although more methodological consensus has been found than in studies conducted prior to 2018, this consensus may be driven by valuation studies for common measures with an international protocol (the 'model' valuation research). Valuing long measures with well-being attributes attracted attention and more realistic design strategies (e.g., inconstant time preference, efficient design and implausible states design) were identified. However, more qualitative and quantitative methodology study is still necessary to evaluate the effect of those new methods. CONCLUSIONS: The use of DCEs in health state valuation continues to grow dramatically and the methodology progress makes the method more reliable and pragmatic. However, study design is driven by international protocols and method selection is not always justified. There is no gold standard for DCE design, presentation format or anchoring method. More qualitative and quantitative methodology study is recommended to evaluate the effect of new methods before researchers make methodology decisions.",1
Improving methods of clinical practice guidelines: From guidelines to pathways to fast-and-frugal trees and decision analysis to develop individualised patient care.,"BACKGROUND: Current methods for developing clinical practice guidelines have several limitations: they are characterised by the ""black box"" operation-a process with defined inputs and outputs but an incomplete understanding of its internal workings; they have ""the integration problem""-a lack of framework for explicitly integrating factors such as patient preferences and trade-offs between benefits and harms; they generate one recommendation at a time that typically are not connected in a coherent analytical framework; and they apply to ""average"" patients, while clinicians and their patients seek advice tailored to individual circumstances. METHODS: We propose augmenting the current guideline development method by converting evidence-based pathways into fast-and-frugal decision trees (FFTs) and integrating them with generalised decision curve analysis to formulate clear, individualised management recommendations. RESULTS: We illustrate the process by developing recommendations for the management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). We converted evidence-based pathways for HIT, developed by the American Society of Hematology, into an FFT. Here, we consider only thrombotic complications and major bleeding. We leveraged the predictive potential of FFTs to compare the effects of argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) using generalised decision curve analysis. We found that DOACs were superior to other treatments if the FFT-predicted probability of HIT exceeded 3%. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed analytical framework connects guidelines, pathways, FFTs, and decision analysis, offering risk-tailored personalised recommendations and addressing current guideline development critiques.",0
Linking Patients' Goals and Priorities to Recommendations for Medication Changes in a Polypharmacy-Focused Structured Clinical Pathway.,"Polypharmacy is associated with poorer health outcomes in older adults. It is challenging to minimize the harmful effects of medications while maximizing benefits of single-disease-focused recommendations. Integrating patient input can balance these factors. The objectives are to describe the goals, priorities, and preferences of participants asked about these in a structured process to polypharmacy, and to describe the extent that decision-making within the process mapped onto these, signaling a patient-centered approach. This is a single-group quasi-experimental study, nested within a feasibility randomized controlled trial. Patient goals and priorities were mapped to medication recommendations made during the intervention. Overall, there were 33 participants who reported 55 functional goals and 66 symptom priorities, and 16 participants reported unwanted medications. Overall, 154 recommendations for medication alterations occurred. Of those, 68 (44%) recommendations mapped to the individual's goals and priorities, whereas the rest were based on clinical judgment where no priorities were expressed. Our results signal this process supports a patient-centered approach: allowing conversations around goals and priorities in a structured process to polypharmacy should be integrated into subsequent medication decisions.",0
Racial Disparity in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Treatment and Survival in the United States.,"INTRODUCTION: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has a higher incidence and prevalence than esophageal adenocarcinoma among Black individuals in the United States. Black individuals have lower ESCC survival. These racial disparities have not been thoroughly investigated. We examined the disparity in treatment and survival stratified by ESCC stage at diagnosis. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried to identify patients with ESCC between 2000 and 2019. The identified cohort was divided into subgroups by race. Patient and cancer characteristics, treatment received, and survival rates were compared across the racial subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 23,768 patients with ESCC were identified. Compared with White individuals, Black individuals were younger and had more distant disease during diagnosis (distant disease: 26.7% vs 23.8%, P < 0.001). Black individuals had lower age-standardized 5-year survival for localized (survival % [95% confidence interval]: 19.3% [16-22.8] vs 27.6% [25.1-30.2]), regional (14.3% [12-16.7] vs 21.1% [19.6-22.7]), and distant (2.9% [1.9-4.1] vs 6.5% [5.5-7.5]) disease. Black individuals were less likely to receive chemotherapy (54.7% vs 57.5%, P = 0.001), radiation (58.5% vs 60.4%, P = 0.03), and surgery (11.4% vs 16.3%, P < 0.0001). DISCUSSION: Black individuals with ESCC have a lower survival rate than White individuals. This could be related to presenting at a later stage but also disparities in which treatments they receive even among individuals with the same stage of disease. To what extent these disparities in receipt of treatment is due to structural racism, social determinants of health, implicit bias, or patient preferences deserves further study.",0
Urological Guidelines for Kidney Stones: Overview and Comprehensive Update.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based guidelines are published by urological organisations for various conditions, including urolithiasis. In this paper, we provide guidance on the management of kidney stone disease (KSD) and compare the American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urologists (EAU) guidelines. METHODS: We evaluate and appraise the evidence and grade of recommendation provided by the AUA and EAU guidelines on urolithiasis (both surgical and medical management). RESULTS: Both the AUA and EAU guidelines provide guidance on the type of imaging, treatment options, and medical therapies and advice on specific patient groups, such as in paediatrics and pregnancy. While the guidelines are generally aligned and based on evidence, some subtle differences exist in the recommendations, but both are generally unanimous for the majority of the principles of management. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that the guidelines should undergo regular updates based on recently published material, and while these guidelines provide a framework, treatment plans should still be personalised, respecting patient preferences, surgical expertise, and various other individual factors, to offer the best outcome for kidney stone patients.",0
Development of vaccines for Chagas disease (CRUZIVAX): stakeholders' preferences and potential impacts on healthcare.,"A vaccine for Chagas disease does not currently exist. This study aims to inform the development of two vaccines for the prevention and treatment of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and guide their pre-clinical phase up to clinical phase I. The three main objectives are: 1) to explore patients' and policy makers' preferences on the candidate vaccines in Argentina and Spain; 2) to investigate health-related quality of life of patients affected by Chagas disease; and 3) to assess the potential health provider savings associated with the vaccines, in terms of resource use and health care costs. Discrete choice experiments will be employed to estimate and characterize the theoretical demand for the vaccines and investigate patients' and policy makers' preferences. Health-related quality of life will be assessed using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Resources use and costs associated with Chagas disease will be investigated using information from the databases of the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona.",1
Study protocol of a randomized controlled trial of fistula vs. graft arteriovenous vascular access in older adults with end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis: the AV access trial.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with hemodialysis requires surgical creation of an arteriovenous (AV) vascular access-fistula (AVF) or graft (AVG)-to avoid (or limit) the use of a central venous catheter (CVC). AVFs have long been considered the first-line vascular access option, with AVGs as second best. Recent studies have suggested that, in older adults, AVGs may be a better strategy than AVFs. Lacking evidence from well-powered randomized clinical trials, integration of these results into clinical decision making is challenging. The main objective of the AV Access Study is to compare, between the two types of AV access, clinical outcomes that are important to patients, physicians, and policy makers. METHODS: This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in adults ≥ 60 years old receiving chronic hemodialysis via a CVC. Eligible participants must have co-existing cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or diabetes mellitus; and vascular anatomy suitable for placement of either type of AV access. Participants are randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to a strategy of AVG or AVF creation. An estimated 262 participants will be recruited across 7 healthcare systems, with average follow-up of 2 years. Questionnaires will be administered at baseline and semi-annually. The primary outcome is the rate of CVC-free days per 100 patient-days. The primary safety outcome is the cumulative incidence of vascular access (CVC or AV access)-related severe infections-defined as access infections that lead to hospitalization or death. Secondary outcomes include access-related healthcare costs and patients' experiences with vascular access care between the two treatment groups. DISCUSSION: In the absence of studies using robust and unbiased research methodology to address vascular access care for hemodialysis patients, clinical decisions are limited to inferences from observational studies. The goal of the AV Access Study is to generate evidence to optimize vascular access care, based on objective, age-specific criteria, while incorporating goals of care and patient preference for vascular access type in clinical decision-making. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is being conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration, and has been approved by the central institutional review board (IRB) of Wake Forest University Health Sciences (approval number: 00069593) and local IRB of each participating clinical center; and was registered on Nov 27, 2020, at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04646226).",0
In the eyes of the beholders: Subjective experiences of positive symptoms among patients with symptoms of psychosis seeking psychotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Reduction of positive symptoms is often the focus of psychiatric treatment for patients with psychosis; however, it is becoming increasingly clear that some patients experience ambivalence towards positive symptoms or may even experience them as pleasant. The present study extends upon work from online studies of patients without verified diagnoses. The first aim was to examine the frequency with which patients report negative, neutral or even positive appraisals of positive symptoms. A second aim was to identify whether these appraisals were associated with medication adherence. METHODS: One-hundred twelve treatment-seeking patients with current symptoms of psychosis completed the Subjective Perception of Positive Symptoms-Revised (SUPPOSY-R), a scale assessing appraisals of positive symptoms (e.g., gain from illness, impact on daily life), as well as questions regarding medication adherence. RESULTS: Although most patients reported experiencing positive symptoms as predominantly unpleasant, appraisals differed between symptom clusters and up to 54.4 % reported that they would miss at least some aspects of positive symptoms should they disappear. Patients particularly welcomed the disappearance of auditory hallucinations (71.2 %). Symptom appraisal was not significantly associated with medication compliance (p > .17); however, more patients with low medication adherence reported they would feel at least some regret if their symptoms were to completely disappear (48.9 %, n = 23) versus patients with high adherence (41.7 %, n = 20). DISCUSSION: Ambivalent or positive appraisals of positive symptoms are lower among treatment-seeking patients compared to patients recruited for online studies, who may not be actively seeking treatment. Auditory hallucinations may cause most distress among treatment-seeking patients. A collaborative approach including assessment of possible positive appraisals of symptoms is important when identifying treatment goals.",0
Influence of Self-Reported Health Impairments on German EQ-5D-5L Values.,"OBJECTIVES: The German EQ-5D-5L value set is based on the average preferences of the general population. Nevertheless, in Germany, there is an ongoing debate about the appropriateness of using general population preferences and whether patient preferences should be used instead. Thus, this research aimed to determine the robustness of the German EQ-5D-5L valuation data for the general population compared with those with health impairments. METHODS: Subgroups were built on the self-reported quality of life, measured with the EQ-5D-5L. To identify which groups significantly influenced the value set, different regression models, including dummy variables for the subgroups, were tested while controlling for preference heterogeneity. Backward selection based on the Akaike information criterion led to significant subgroup dummies, which were analyzed in more detail. For each significant subgroup, the value set model was estimated separately. The models were then compared. Sociodemographics of the subgroups were considered. RESULTS: Three significant dummies were identified: state 11111, severity levels 5 to 7, and self-reported problems with pain/discomfort. The value sets for the 6 subgroups were compared with the national German value set, showing only marginal deviations. The mean absolute deviation ranged from 0.004 to 0.013. No different densities were identified for the decrements of the different value sets. CONCLUSIONS: People with self-reported health impairments do not have different EQ-5D-5L health state preferences compared with the German general population. Further research is needed to determine whether the presence of a chronic health condition has a larger influence on health state valuation than the general population.",0
Telemedicine for Neurosurgery Consultations at a Pituitary Center of Excellence: Patient Preference and Willingness to Proceed with Surgery.,"Objective  The purpose of this study was to evaluate pituitary tumor patient satisfaction with telemedicine, patient preference for telemedicine, potential socioeconomic benefit of telemedicine, and patients' willingness to proceed with surgery based on a telemedicine visit alone. Method  In total, 134 patients who had pituitary surgery and a telemedicine visit during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (April 23, 2020-March 4, 2021) were called to participate in a 13-part questionnaire. Chi-square, ANOVA, and Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests were used to determine significance. Result  Of 134 patients contacted, 90 responded (67%). Ninety-five percent were ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with their telemedicine visit, with 62% stating their visit was ""the same"" or ""better"" than previous in-person appointments. Eighty-two percent of the patients rated their telemedicine visit as ""easy"" or ""very easy."" On average, patients saved 150 minutes by using telemedicine compared with patient reported in-person visit times. Seventy-seven percent of patients reported the need to take off from work for in-person visits, compared with just 12% when using telemedicine. Forty-nine percent of patients preferred in-person visits, 34% preferred telemedicine, and 17% had no preference. Fifty percent of patients said they would feel comfortable proceeding with surgery based on a telemedicine visit alone. Patients with both initial evaluation and follow-up conducted via telemedicine were more likely to feel comfortable proceeding with surgery based on a telemedicine visit alone compared with patients who had only follow-up telemedicine visits ( p  = 0.051). Conclusion  Many patients are satisfied with telemedicine visits and feel comfortable proceeding with surgery based on a telemedicine visit alone. Telemedicine is an important adjunct to increase access to care at a Pituitary Center of Excellence.",0
A discrete choice experiment to quantify the influence of trial features on the decision to participate in cystic fibrosis trials.,"BACKGROUND: Patient-centred trial design optimises recruitment and retention, reduces trial failure rates and increases the diversity of trial cohorts. This allows safe and effective treatments to reach clinic more quickly. To achieve this, patients' views must be incorporated into trial design. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was used to quantify preferences of pwCF for trials features; medicine type, trial location, stipend, washout, drug access on trial completion and trial design. Respondents were presented pairs of hypothetical trial scenarios with different level combinations assigned through experimental design. Respondents were asked to pick their preferred option or decline both. The cross-sectional data were explored using a Random Parameters Logit model. RESULTS: We received 207 eligible responses between Oct2020-Jan2021. The strongest influence on the decision to participate was trial location; pwCF favour participation at their usual clinical centre. Greater travel distances made respondents less willing to participate. Post-trial drug access ranked second. pwCF would rather participate in modulator trials than trials of other drugs. In general, pwCF did not favour a washout period, but were more prepared to washout non-modulators than modulators. Stipend provision was not ranked highly, but higher stipends increased intention to participate. Trial design (placebo vs open-label) had minimal influence on the decision to participate. There are complex interactions between placebos and washouts. CONCLUSIONS: We used quantitative methods to systematically elicit preferences of pwCF for clinical trials' features. We explore the relevance of our findings to trial design and delivery in the current CF trials landscape.",1
A scoping review of shared care models for rheumatoid arthritis with patient-initiated follow-up.,"OBJECTIVE: An emerging strategy to address access challenges to rheumatologists for patients with RA is shared care between primary and specialist care, with patient-initiated rheumatologist follow-up as needed. The objective of this scoping review was to explore studies implementing this model of care. METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched from 01/01/2000-31/03/2022 using three main concepts (RA, shared care, patient-initiated follow-up). English-language studies of any design were included if they described the implementation and/or outcomes of shared care model for RA with patient-initiated follow-up. Two authors reviewed and selected articles in duplicate and extracted data on study characteristics, care model implementation and outcomes according to a pre-specified protocol. RESULTS: Following duplicate removal, 1578 articles were screened for inclusion and 58 underwent full-text review. Sixteen articles were included, representing 10 unique studies. Five studies had qualitative outcomes and two were pre-implementation studies. Model implementation varied significantly between studies. Effectiveness data was available in 10 studies and demonstrated equivalent outcomes for the model of care (disease activity, radiographic damage, quality of life). Health system costs were equivalent or lower than usual care. While satisfaction with care was equivalent or improved in shared care models with patient-initiated follow-up, some concerns were expressed in qualitative evaluation around appropriate patient selection for such models, and information for health equity evaluation was not reported. CONCLUSIONS: While shared care models with patient-initiated follow-up may offer comparable outcomes for RA, further work is required to understand patient preferences, health equity considerations and longer-term outcomes for such models of care.",0
"Introduction of the L-PAP Flap: Bipedicled, Conjoined, and Stacked Thigh-Based Flaps for Autologous Breast Reconstruction.","SUMMARY: Thigh-based flaps are increasingly popular options for autologous breast reconstruction in the setting of abdominal donor-site inadequacy, previous surgery, or patient preference, but the volume and skin associated with these flaps are often lacking relative to the abdomen. An individualized, shared decision-making approach to donor-site selection was adopted based on body shape, surgical history, lifestyle, reconstructive needs, and patient expectations. Different thigh-based flaps combined in stacked, bipedicled, or conjoined configurations were selected to maximize efficient use of available soft-tissue skin and volume while optimizing donor-site aesthetics. A total of 23 thigh-based stacked, bipedicled, or conjoined profunda artery perforator (PAP), lateral thigh perforator (LTP), or gracilis musculocutaneous flap components were used in six patients. Configurations included bilateral stacked PAP and LTP flaps, bipedicled posterolateral thigh flaps based on the LTP and PAP (L-PAP), and bipedicled thigh flaps based on the gracilis and PAP pedicles. Most anastomoses were performed to the antegrade and retrograde internal mammary vessels; intraflap anastomoses were performed in one case. There were no partial or total flap losses. There was one donor-site seroma. Design of stacked, bipedicled, and conjoined thigh-based flaps using multiple conventional flap components allows for tailored approaches to donor-site utilization based on individual body shape in selected patients. Bipedicled design with the L-PAP flap represents one strategy in appropriate cases to overcome skin and volume deficiencies while facilitating coning and projection. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.",0
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Dental Preferences of Patients at Private University Hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","Studies that particularly look into how the pandemic has affected Saudi Arabian patients' dental preferences are scarce. The majority of the research done so far has focused on the pandemic's broad effects on oral health rather than the specific changes in patient preferences for dental care. Therefore, the primary goal of the study was to examine how patients at a private university dental hospital underwent dental procedures both before and after the pandemic. The study is a retrospective analysis of patient data from March 2019 to February 2022 obtained from electronic hospital records (Dentoplus). The data extracted information pertaining to the number of patients and their periodic visits. The data was examined via statistical tests. At 0.05, the significance level was chosen. According to the research, compared to non-lockdown times, lockdown times saw a considerable drop in the number of patients scheduling appointments. There was also a significant decrease in the number of first-time patients during lockdown periods. The study also revealed a significant increase in the number of cancelled appointments and patients who discontinued treatment during lockdown periods. The age and gender of the patients did not have a significant effect on these findings. The study's findings suggest that dental professionals need to be aware of these changes in patient behavior and adapt their services accordingly. Dental clinics may need to focus on promoting their services and ensuring that patients feel safe and comfortable seeking dental care during the pandemic.",0
"Trial of labor after cesarean, vaginal birth after cesarean, and the risk of uterine rupture: an expert review.","The decision to pursue a trial of labor after cesarean delivery is complex and depends on patient preference, the likelihood of successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery, assessment of the risks vs benefits of trial of labor after cesarean delivery, and available resources to support safe trial of labor after cesarean delivery at the planned birthing center. The most feared complication of trial of labor after cesarean delivery is uterine rupture, which can have catastrophic consequences, including substantial maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Although the absolute risk of uterine rupture is low, several clinical, historical, obstetrical, and intrapartum factors have been associated with increased risk. It is therefore critical for clinicians managing patients during trial of labor after cesarean delivery to be aware of these risk factors to appropriately select candidates for trial of labor after cesarean delivery and maximize the safety and benefits while minimizing the risks. Caution is advised when considering labor augmentation and induction in patients with a previous cesarean delivery. With established hospital safety protocols that dictate close maternal and fetal monitoring, avoidance of prostaglandins, and careful titration of oxytocin infusion when induction agents are needed, spontaneous and induced trial of labor after cesarean delivery are safe and should be offered to most patients with 1 previous low transverse, low vertical, or unknown uterine incision after appropriate evaluation, counseling, planning, and shared decision-making. Future research should focus on clarifying true risk factors and identifying the optimal approach to intrapartum and induction management, tools for antenatal prediction, and strategies for prevention of uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean delivery. A better understanding will facilitate patient counseling, support efforts to improve trial of labor after cesarean delivery and vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates, and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean delivery.",0
Do Patients Want to Be Involved in Their Carpal Tunnel Surgery Decisions? A Multicenter Study.,"PURPOSE: Carpal tunnel syndrome requires multiple decisions during its management, including regarding preoperative studies, surgical technique, and postoperative wound management. Whether patients have varying preferences for the degree to which they share in decisions during different phases of care has not been explored. The goal of our study was to evaluate the degree to which patients want to be involved along the care pathway in the management of carpal tunnel syndrome. METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter study of patients undergoing carpal tunnel surgery at 5 academic medical centers. Patients received a 27-item questionnaire to rate their preferred level of involvement for decisions made during 3 phases of care for carpal tunnel surgery: preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative. Preferences for participation were quantified using the Control Preferences Scale. These questions were scored on a scale of 0 to 4, with patient-only decisions scoring 0, semiactive decisions scoring 1, equally collaborative decisions scoring 2, semipassive decisions scoring 3, and physician-only decisions scoring 4. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients completed the survey between November 2018 and April 2019. Overall, patients preferred semipassive decisions in all phases of care (median score, 3). Patients preferred equally collaborative decisions for preoperative decisions (median score, 2). Patients preferred a semipassive decision-making role for intraoperative and postoperative decisions (median score, 3), suggesting these did not need to be equally shared. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome prefer varying degrees of involvement in the decision-making process of their care and prefer a semipassive role in intraoperative and postoperative decisions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Strategies to engage patients to varying degrees for all decisions during the management of carpal tunnel syndrome, such as decision aids for preoperative surgical decisions and educational handouts for intraoperative decisions, may facilitate aligning decisions with patient preferences for shared decision-making.",0
Migraine Patient Care Model Preferences in a Community Practice.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Developing high-value care models with limited resources for large populations of individuals with migraine requires advanced understanding of patient preferences for care delivery methods. In this study, we aimed to inform the development of migraine care models by assessing patient preferences for types of care delivery and determining differences based on migraine frequency and disability. METHODS: We analyzed unpublished data from a cross-sectional survey of 516 randomly selected individuals with migraine within a community practice associated with Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. RESULTS: Individuals with chronic migraine, compared with those with episodic migraine, were more likely to prefer a visit with a neurologist (p = 0.0005), synchronous telephone conference with primary care provider (PCP) and neurologist (p = 0.0102), and a written migraine action plan in the medical record (p = 0.0343). Compared with those with mild/no disability, individuals with moderate-to-severe disability were more likely to prefer a visit with a neurologist (p < 0.0001), synchronous video or telephone conference with PCP and neurologist (p < 0.0001), PCP communication with neurologist (p = 0.0099), electronic message to primary care team with access to neurologist (p = 0.0216), and written action plan in the medical record (p = 0.0011). Collectively, individuals most preferred telephone follow-up and least preferred communications with a nurse or pharmacist or generalized education (all p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: We observed differences in migraine care delivery preferences between migraine frequency and level of migraine disability. Observations support development of care pathways that include a written migraine action plan, primary care-neurology collaboration including nontraditional interactions, and prioritization of traditional neurology consultation for the most disabled patients.",0
Talking technology: exploring chatbots as a tool for cataract patient education.,"CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Worldwide, millions suffer from cataracts, which impair vision and quality of life. Cataract education improves outcomes, satisfaction, and treatment adherence. Lack of health literacy, language and cultural barriers, personal preferences, and limited resources may all impede effective communication. BACKGROUND: AI can improve patient education by providing personalised, interactive, and accessible information tailored to patient understanding, interest, and motivation. AI chatbots can have human-like conversations and give advice on numerous topics. METHODS: This study investigated the efficacy of chatbots in cataract patient education relative to traditional resources like the AAO website, focusing on information accuracy,understandability, actionability, and readability. A descriptive comparative design was used to analyse quantitative data from frequently asked questions about cataracts answered by ChatGPT, Bard, Bing AI, and the AAO website. SOLO taxonomy, PEMAT, and the Flesch-Kincaid ease score were used to collect and analyse the data. RESULTS: Chatbots scored higher than AAO website on cataract-related questions in terms of accuracy (mean SOLO score ChatGPT: 3.1 ± 0.31, Bard: 2.9 ± 0.72, Bing AI: 2.65 ± 0.49, AAO website: 2.4 ± 0.6, (p < 0.001)). For understandability (mean PEMAT-U score AAO website: 0,89 ± 0,04, ChatGPT 0,84 ± 0,02, Bard: 0,84 ± 0,02, Bing AI: 0,81 ± 0,02, (p < 0.001)), and actionability (mean PEMAT-A score ChatGPT: 0.86 ± 0.03, Bard: 0.85 ± 0.06, Bing AI: 0.81 ± 0.05, AAO website: 0.81 ± 0.06, (p < 0.001)) AAO website scored better than chatbots. Flesch-Kincaid readability ease analysis showed that Bard (55,5 ± 8,48) had the highest mean score, followed by AAO website (51,96 ± 12,46), Bing AI (41,77 ± 9,53), and ChatGPT (34,38 ± 9,75, (p < 0.001)). CONCLUSION: Chatbots have the potential to provide more detailed and accurate data than the AAO website. On the other hand, the AAO website has the advantage of providing information that is more understandable and practical. When patient preferences are not taken into account, generalised or biased information can decrease reliability.",0
Understanding patient cost-sharing thresholds for diabetes treatment attributes via a discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: The process used to prefer certain products across drug classes for diabetes is generally focused on comparative effectiveness and cost. However, payers rarely tie patient preference for treatment attributes to formulary management resulting in a misalignment of value defined by providers, payers, and patients. OBJECTIVES: To explore patients' willingness to pay (WTP) for the predetermined high-value and low-value type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatments within a health plan. METHODS: A cross-sectional discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey was used to determine patient preference for the benefit, risk, and cost attributes of T2DM treatments. A comprehensive literature review of patient preference studies in diabetes and a review of guidelines and medical literature identified study attributes. Patients and diabetes experts were interviewed and instructed to identify, prioritize, and comment on which attributes of diabetes treatments were most important to T2DM patients. The patients enrolled in a health plan were asked to respond to the survey. A multinomial logit model was developed to determine the relative importance and the patient's WTP of each attribute. The patients' relative values based on WTPs for T2DM treatments were calculated and compared with the treatments by a health plan. RESULTS: A total of 7 attributes were selected to develop a web-based DCE questionnaire survey. The responses from a total of 58 patients were analyzed. Almost half (48.3%) of the respondents took oral medications and injections for T2DM. The most prevalent side effects due to diabetes medications were gastrointestinal (43.1%), followed by weight gain (39.7%) and nausea (32.8%). Patients were willing to pay more for treatments with proven cardiovascular benefit and for the risk reduction of hospitalization from heart failure. On the other hand, they would pay less for treatments with higher gastrointestinal side effects. Patients were willing to pay the most for sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist agents and the least for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides information to better align patient, provider, and payer preferences in both benefit design and value-based formulary strategy for diabetes treatments. A preferred placement of treatments with cardiovascular benefits and lower adverse gastrointestinal side effects may lead to increased adherence to medications and improved clinical outcomes at a lower overall cost to both patients and their health plan. DISCLOSURES: This study was supported by a grant from the PhRMA Foundation.",1
Alternatives to Opioids for Managing Pain.,"The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) revised the definition of pain in 2020 as ""An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage.""  Ongoing or recurring pain for three or more months has been defined as chronic pain by the same organization.  In comparison, acute pain can have an abrupt onset and is usually short-lasting. Chronic pain problems usually manifest initially as acute pain, and many chronic pain conditions are associated with an intermittent acute flare-up of pain. Chronic pain is a widespread health problem, with approximately 100 million people in the United States suffering from chronic pain in 2008. About 13 to 50% of adults in the United Kingdom have been estimated to suffer from chronic pain. This leads to a significant economic toll through direct healthcare costs associated with treatment and lost productivity. The estimated economic burden ranged from $560 to $635 billion in 2010, which is much higher than that of diabetes, cardiac problems, or cancer. The goal of treatment for chronic pain is the reduction of pain intensity and the improvement of function and quality of life. Apart from efficacy, the adverse effects, side-effect profile, economic factors, and patient preference should also be considered during the selection of a treatment modality. Multimodal management has been recommended for chronic pain, including medications, exercises, lifestyle modification, physical therapy, pain psychology, behavioral modalities, interventional pain modalities, and alternative medicine.",0
Patient-centered care outcomes for patients in the emergency department with a non-English language preference: A scoping review.,"OBJECTIVE: This review highlights what is known about patient-centered care outcomes (PCCOs) for emergency department (ED) patients with non-English language preferences (NELP). METHODS: Four databases were searched and included article were written in English, presented primary evidence, published in a peer-reviewed journal, and reported PCCOs from the perspective of ED patients with NELP. PCCOs were defined using the Institute of Medicine definition, outcomes that evaluate respect and responsiveness to patient preferences, needs and values. Two reviewers assessed all articles, extracted data, and resolved discrepancies. PCCOs were grouped in categories (needs, preferences, and values) based on the definition's domains. RESULTS: Of the 6524 potentially eligible studies, 20 met inclusion criteria. Of these, 16 focused on needs; 4 on preferences and 8 on values. Within patient need, five studies found a large unmet need for language services. Within patient value, three found that language discordance negatively influenced perceptions of care. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies in this review found that not speaking English negatively influenced perceptions of care and highlighted a large unmet need for language services in the ED. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: More work needs to be done to characterize PCCOs in ED patients with NELP and develop interventions to improve care.",0
Patients' expectations of and experiences with psychosocial care needs in perioperative nursing: a descriptive study.,"BACKGROUND: Meeting inpatients' psychosocial care needs is essential for their wellbeing, recovery, and positive experiences. This study aimed to describe and compare surgical inpatients' subjective perceptions of the importance of fundamental psychosocial and overall care received. METHODS: A descriptive study with a convenient sample was conducted from September 2019 to April 2020. A total of 194 surgical inpatients from Norway and Denmark answered a perioperative user participation questionnaire on the day of discharge. The questionnaire was previously face- and content validated. The questionnaire assessed patients' sociodemographic characteristics and four dimensions of fundamental care domains: Psychosocial, Relational, Physical, and System level. This study reports the results from the psychosocial domain. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations were used to analyze background information variables. The congruency between participants' expectations of and experiences with psychosocial care is presented. RESULTS: The inpatients expected (and experienced) the healthcare personnel to treat them with respect and dignity, and to be involved and informed throughout their perioperative care. The average ratings regarding these aspects of psychosocial care needs were 72.1-93.8%. There was congruency between patients' perceptions of the subjective importance (SI) of psychosocial fundamental care and their perceived reality (PR) of care. Congruency between high SI and high PR ranged from 59.1 to 92.2%, and congruency between low SI and low PR ranged from 0 to 6.6%. Incongruency between SI and PR varied between 5.9 and 39.6% and was mainly related to higher PR than SI. We found no association between education level, sex, length of stay, age, and patient expectations of or experiences with psychosocial care needs. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical inpatients in Norway and Denmark experience respectful and dignified treatment, and they feel involved and informed in their perioperative care. It is important to include patient perspectives in further research to avoid missed care and disconnection between what patients prefer and what healthcare personnel plan to do. Understanding patient preferences might also lead to less stress and workload for healthcare personnel.",0
Australian Patient Preferences for Discussing Spiritual Issues in the Hospital Setting: An Exploratory Mixed Methods Study.,"While there is high patient acceptance for clinical staff discussing issues regarding spirituality with hospital inpatients, it is not clear which staff member patients prefer for these discussions. This unique exploratory study investigated inpatient preferences regarding which staff member should raise the topic of spirituality. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with inpatients at six hospitals in Sydney, Australia (n = 897), with a subset invited to participate in qualitative interviews (n = 41). Pastoral care staff (32.9%) were the preferred staff members with whom to discuss spiritual issues, followed by doctors (22.4%). Qualitative findings indicated that individual characteristics of the staff member are more important than their role.",0
What types of information do pharmacists include in comprehensive medication management review reports? A qualitative content analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Comprehensive medication management reviews are an established intervention to identify medication-related problems, such as the prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications, and under- and over-prescribing. However, the types of information included in written reports of comprehensive medication management reviews, beyond types of medication-related problems, are unknown. AIM: This study aimed to explore the types of information Australian pharmacists include in their written reports following comprehensive medication management reviews. METHOD: Australian consultant pharmacists were invited to upload their 10 most recent written reports of their domiciliary-based comprehensive medication management reviews. A random selection of the reports, stratified by each pharmacist, were included for qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-two de-identified reports from eight consultant pharmacists located in five of the eight Australian States and Territories were included for analysis. From the evaluated reports, four major categories of information were identified: (1) patient details such as date of interview (n = 72, 100%) and medicine history (n = 70, 97%); (2) pharmacist assessment including assessment of the patient (n = 70, 97%), medicines management (n = 68, 94%) and medicine-related issues (n = 60, 83%); (3) pharmacist recommendations, specifically pharmacological recommendations (n = 67, 93%); and (4) patient-centred experiences such as perspectives on medicines (n = 56, 78%). Reporting of patient-centred experiences appeared most variably in the included reports, including patient concerns (n = 38, 53%), willingness for change (n = 27, 38%), patient preferences (n = 13, 18%), and patient goals (n = 7, 10%). CONCLUSION: Pharmacists within our study included a wide variety of information in their comprehensive medication management review reports. Aside from medication-related problems, pharmacists commonly provided a holistic assessment of the patients they care for. However, variability across reports has the potential to impact consistent service delivery.",0
Radiation Therapy Can Be Safely Incorporated into Pretransplantation Treatment Regimens for Patients with Multiple Myeloma.,"Primary treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) often involves systemic induction therapy (SIT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Radiation therapy (RT) is sometimes used for palliation; however, many practitioners avoid RT out of concern that future peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection required for ASCT may be compromised. In this study, we retrospectively examined the possible effect of RT on PBPC collection. We reviewed the charts of 732 patients with MM treated with RT at our institution from 1999 to 2017, including patients who received RT prior to PBPC collection for planned ASCT. RT plans (both MM and non-MM RT) were reviewed to estimate the percentage of bone marrow (BM) treated using published estimates of skeletal BM distribution. Statistics were performed using Pearson correlation and the t-test. The 732 MM patients included 485 planned for ASCT; of these, 223 received RT prior to PBPC collection and were included in the final cohort. The median age at PBPC collection was 59 years (range, 33 to 80 years). For SIT, patients received combination regimens including the following agents: bortezomib (142 patients; 64%), lenalidomide (111 patients; 50%), and alkylators (46 patients; 21%). Nine patients (4%) received dexamethasone alone. The median cumulative %BM treated per patient was 6.7 (range .0 to 47.4). The median RT dose was 24 Gy (range, 10.0 to 75.6 Gy). Mobilization was performed using granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone (189 patients; 85%), G-CSF with plerixafor (15 patients; 7%), or chemotherapy (19 patients; 9%). A median of 7.8 × 10(6) CD34(+)/kg PBPCs (range, .5 to 54.8× 10(6) CD34(+)/kg) were collected in a median of 3 (range, 1 to 9) apheresis procedures. One hundred ninety-six patients (99%) collected ≥2.0 × 10(6) CD34(+)/kg PBPCs, and 166 (83%) collected >5.0 × 10(6) CD34(+)/kg PBPCs. The number of PBPCs collected was not associated with %BM treated (P = .15) or RT dose (P = .56). The number of apheresis procedures performed was not associated with %BM treated (P = .54) or RT dose (P = .85). The amount of PBPCs collected did not differ significantly between patients receiving RT to the pelvis/sacrum (P = .20) and those receiving RT to the spine (P = .13). The time to platelet engraftment was longer for patients with higher %BM treated (P = .02). Eleven patients did not undergo a confirmed ASCT, owing to patient preference (3 patients), trial therapy (1 patient), comorbidities (1 patient), election for hospice (1 patient), inadequate collection (4 patients), or inadequate follow-up (1 patient). In our study cohort, RT prior to ASCT did not impair successful ASCT. RT must be carefully planned and delivered to ensure safe incorporation into pre-ASCT treatment regimens.",0
Rate and reasons for peritoneal dialysis dropout following haemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis switch: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Patient experiences and survival outcomes can be influenced by the circumstances related to dialysis initiation and subsequent modality choices. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the rate and reasons for peritoneal dialysis (PD) dropout following haemodialysis (HD) to PD switch. METHOD: This systematic review conducted searches in four databases, including Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (study ID: CRD42023405718). Outcomes included factors leading to the switch from HD to PD, the rate and reasons for PD dropout and mortality difference in two groups (PD first group versus HD to PD group). The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist and the GRADE tool were used to assess quality. RESULTS: 4971 papers were detected, and 13 studies were included. On meta-analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in PD dropout in the PD first group (OR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.61, 1.09; I(2) = 83%; P = 0.16), however, there was a statistically significant reduction in the rate of mortality (OR: 0.48; 95%CI: 0.25, 0.92; I2 = 73%; P = 0.03) compared to the HD to PD group. The primary reasons for HD to PD switch, included vascular access failure, patient preference, social issues, and cardiovascular disease. Causes for PD dropout differed between the two groups, but inadequate dialysis and peritonitis were the main reasons for PD dropout in both groups. CONCLUSION: Compared to the PD first group, a previous HD history may not impact PD dropout rates for patients, but it could impact mortality in the HD to PD group. The reasons for PD dropout differed between the two groups, with no statistical differences. Psychosocial reasons for PD dropout are valuable to further research. Additionally, establishing a consensus on the definition of PD dropout is crucial for future studies.",0
Patient motivation and preferences in changing co-occurring health risk behaviors in general hospital patients.,"OBJECTIVES: More than 60% of general hospital patients report ≥ 2 health risk behaviors (HRBs), i.e. tobacco smoking, at-risk alcohol use, unhealthy diet, and/or insufficient physical activity. This study investigates a) the association between numbers of HRBs and motivation to change, b) patient preferences for receiving feedback on HRBs, and c) patients' expected gain in quality of life if behavior change made. METHODS: In 2020/2021, 256 18-64-year-old general hospital patients (72.1% of eligibles) reported on their motivation to change each of their HRBs. Associations between HRB number and motivation were assessed using multivariate linear regressions. Participants ranked HRBs concerning their interest in receiving feedback and concerning their expected gain in quality of life if behavior change occurred. RESULTS: Higher HRB number was negatively related to motivation among at-risk alcohol users (p = 0.034); 24.6% expected gain in their quality of life from behavior change. Participants overall appeared more favorable to feedback about vegetable/fruit intake and physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Unhealthier lifestyle may be accompanied by decreased motivation to change in at-risk alcohol users. In case of co-occurring HRBs, asking patients for expected gain in quality of life may help guiding intervention target. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Relying on patient selection only, may often leave substance-use unaddressed.",0
Preference Elicitation and Treatment Decision-Making Among Men Diagnosed With Prostate Cancer: Randomized Controlled Trial Results of Healium.,"BACKGROUND: Elicitation of patients' preferences is an integral part of shared decision-making, the recommended approach for prostate cancer decision-making. Existing decision aids for this population often do not specifically focus on patients' preferences. Healium is a brief interactive web-based decision aid that aims to elicit patients' treatment preferences and is designed for a low health literate population. OBJECTIVE: This study used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether Healium, designed to target preference elicitation, is as efficacious as Healing Choices, a comprehensive education and decision tool, in improving outcomes for decision-making and emotional quality of life. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who had not yet made a treatment decision were randomly assigned to the brief Healium intervention or Healing Choices, a decision aid previously developed by our group that serves as a virtual information center on prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. Assessments were completed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months post baseline, and included decisional outcomes (decisional conflict, satisfaction with decision, and preparation for decision-making), and emotional quality of life (anxiety/tension and depression), along with demographics, comorbidities, and health literacy. RESULTS: A total of 327 individuals consented to participate in the study (171 were randomized to the Healium intervention arm and 156 were randomized to Healing Choices). The majority of the sample was non-Hispanic (272/282, 96%), White (239/314, 76%), married (251/320, 78.4%), and was on average 62.4 (SD 6.9) years old. Within both arms, there was a significant decrease in decisional conflict from baseline to 6 weeks postbaseline (Healium, P≤.001; Healing Choices, P≤.001), and a significant increase in satisfaction with one's decision from 6 weeks to 3 months (Healium, P=.04; Healing Choices, P=.01). Within both arms, anxiety/tension (Healium, P=.23; Healing Choices, P=.27) and depression (Healium, P=.001; Healing Choices, P≤.001) decreased from baseline to 6 weeks, but only in the case of depression was the decrease statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Healium, our brief decision aid focusing on treatment preference elicitation, is as successful in reducing decisional conflict as our previously tested comprehensive decision aid, Healing Choices, and has the added benefit of brevity, making it the ideal tool for integration into the physician consultation and electronic medical record.

Non-pharmacological and nonsurgical interventions in male urinary incontinence: A scoping review.,"AIMS: To describe and synthesize non-pharmacological and nonsurgical interventions for male urinary incontinence from the existing literature. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodology suggested by Arksey and O'Malley: (1) identification of the research questions; (2) identification of relevant studies using a three-step search recommended by JBI: an initial search within PubMed and CINAHL, a comprehensive literature search within PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and literature search of references lists; (3) study selection; (4) data extraction and charting; (5) collation, summarization, and reporting of the results. The PRISMA-ScR Checklist was used to report. RESULTS: A total of 4602 studies were identified, of which 87 studies were included. Approximately 78% were randomized controlled trials. More than 88% of the participants were men with prostate cancer. Exercising pelvic floor muscles 30 times per day for 12 weeks was the most frequently reported. Parameters of electrical stimulation were typically set up to 50 Hz and 300 μs for frequency and width of pulse, respectively, and lasted for 15 min. Pure pelvic floor muscle training, Pilates, Yoga, whole body vibration, diaphragm/abdominal muscle training, micturition interruption exercise, acupuncture, and auriculotherapy showed positive effects on reducing urinary incontinence. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested implementing pelvic floor muscle training alone before or after surgery can both prompt the recovery of continence in men after prostate cancer surgery. The decision to use biofeedback or electrical stimulation to enhance the therapeutic effect of pelvic floor muscle training should be approached with caution. More rigorous designed studies are needed to validate the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine techniques and diverse novel methods. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Physicians and nurses need to be up to date on the latest evidence-based non-pharmacological and nonsurgical interventions in male urinary incontinence and select appropriate interventions based on available medical resources and patient preferences.",0
The experience of patients with lung cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic and its importance for post-pandemic outpatient cancer care planning: A cross sectional study exploring the roles of age and frailty.,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the care and experiences of people with cancer, but it presented an opportunity to improve the delivery of outpatient care post-pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an observational cross-sectional study with people with lung cancer throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey investigated patients' experiences and preferences regarding the delivery of cancer care to plan for post-pandemic care, as well as the pandemic's impact on their functional status (physical and psycho-social), exploring the role of age and frailty. RESULTS: Amongst 282 eligible participants, 88%, 86%, and 59% of patients reported feeling appropriately supported during the pandemic by their cancer centre, friends/family, and primary care services, respectively. Remote oncology consultations were delivered to 90% of patients during the pandemic, of which 3% did not meet patients' expectations. Regarding post-pandemic outpatient care preferences, face-to-face appointments were preferred by 93% for the first appointment, by 64% when discussing imaging results, and by 60% for reviews during anti-cancer treatments. Older patients aged 70 years and above were more likely to favour face-to-face appointments (p = 0.007), regardless of their frailty status. Patient preferences changed over time, with the more recent participants preferring remote appointments during anti-cancer treatments (p = 0.0278). Regarding the pandemic's impact, abnormal levels of anxiety and depression were found in 16% and 17% of patients, respectively. Younger patients experienced higher abnormal levels of anxiety and depression (p = 0.036, p = 0.021). Amongst the older sub-group, those with frailty had higher levels of anxiety and depression (p < 0.001). Amongst all participants, 54% reported a considerable negative impact from the pandemic on different aspects of their daily life, particularly emotional and psychological health and sleep patterns, which were more marked in younger patients and the older sub-group with frailty. Older patients without frailty reported the least impact on their functional status. DISCUSSION: There is a need for more personalised outpatient consultation options during cancer care. Whilst there is a preference for face-to-face consultations for older patients, following the pandemic there is a growing acceptance of remote consultations particularly during anti-cancer treatment. Older patients with lung cancer without frailty were less affected by the pandemic than those with frailty and younger patients, requiring less support from healthcare services.",0
Effects of Participant's Choice of Different Digital Interventions on Outcomes for Binge-Spectrum Eating Disorders: A Pilot Doubly Randomized Preference Trial.,"It is unclear whether offering individuals a choice between different digital intervention programs affects treatment outcomes. To generate initial insights, we conducted a pilot doubly randomized preference trial to test whether offering individuals with binge-spectrum eating disorder a choice between two digital interventions is causally linked with superior outcomes than random assignment to these interventions. Participants with recurrent binge eating were randomized to either a choice (n = 77) or no-choice (n = 78) group. Those in the choice group could choose one of the two digital programs, while those in the no-choice group were assigned a program at random. The two digital interventions (a broad and a focused program) took 4 weeks to complete, were based on cognitive-behavioral principles and have demonstrated comparable efficacy, but differ in scope, content, and targeted change mechanisms. Most participants (79%) allocated to the choice condition chose the broad program. While both groups experienced improvements in primary (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire global scores and number of binge eating episodes over the past month) and secondary outcomes (dietary restraint, body image concerns, etc.), no significant between-group differences were observed. The two groups did not differ on dropout rates, nor on most indices of intervention engagement. Findings provide preliminary insights towards the role of client preferences in digital mental health interventions for eating disorders. Client preferences may not determine outcomes when digital interventions are based on similar underlying principles, although larger trials are needed to confirm this.",0
Preferences for cardiovascular and pulmonary rehabilitation care: A discrete choice experiment among patients in Lebanon.,"OBJECTIVE: Patient preferences are important in designing optimal rehabilitation care. The aim of this study is to assess preferences for rehabilitation care among two groups of respondents. DESIGN: An online discrete choice experiment survey was carried out. SETTING: We use data for Lebanon, a country where rehabilitation care is still underdeveloped. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who have undergone or are currently undergoing rehabilitation treatment (users) and those who have not (yet) used rehabilitation care (non-users). INTERVENTION: Patients were asked to repeatedly choose between two hypothetical rehabilitation care packages with seven different attributes: attitude of the staff, travel time to clinic, out-of-pocket costs, medical equipment, rehabilitation plan, additional lifestyle education session, and support during rehabilitation care. MAIN MEASURES: Preference heterogeneity among patients with different characteristics was investigated using random effect binary logistic regression (software package Stata 15). RESULTS: In total, 126 respondents completed the survey. The most preferred attribute was an informal and friendly attitude of the staff followed by modern medical equipment, additional lifestyle education session via eHealth, and support during the rehabilitation program via phone call or SMS. Respondents were less in favor of going to the rehabilitation clinic and paying additional out-of-pocket costs for the rehabilitation treatment. This rank order was similar between users and non-users. CONCLUSION: Preferences of patients regarding the type of program chosen (eHealth or at clinical-based) need to be included in future rehabilitation programs. Improving patient experience with rehabilitation programs by giving the best care based on a patient-centered approach is essential.",1
Stability of Stated Preferences: Vaccine Priority Setting before and during the First COVID-19 Lockdown.,"BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are frequently used to study preferences and quantify tradeoffs in decision making. It is important to understand how stable their results are. OBJECTIVE: To investigate to what extent an extreme change in context, the COVID-19 pandemic, affected preferences for vaccine priority setting, as observed in an earlier DCE. METHODS: We replicated a DCE in which participants had to prioritize vaccination programs for public funding. The initial DCE was executed in Flanders (Belgium) right before the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (December 2019, N = 1,636). The replicated DCE was executed 6 months later when the population was in lockdown (April 2020, N = 1,127). A total of 612 respondents participated in both waves of the DCE. We used panel mixed logit models to quantify attribute and level importance and compared utility estimates for consistency. RESULTS: The number of vaccine-preventable deaths became less important during the pandemic than before, whereas the influential attributes, the vaccine's contribution to disease eradication and certainty about vaccine effectiveness became even more important. Respondents attached equal importance to the number of patients with transient or permanent morbidity, to the disease's economic impact as well as to its equity profile. CONCLUSION: Different preferences for vaccine priority setting were observed during the first COVID-19 lockdown as compared with before, although these differences were, given the extreme nature of the changing circumstances, relatively small. HIGHLIGHTS: We replicated a discrete choice experiment (DCE) about vaccine priority setting during the first COVID-19 lockdown and compared results with those from the original setting.The major attributes, contribution to disease eradication, and scientific certainty about vaccine effectiveness became even more important than they already were, whereas avoidable mortality became less important.Respondents attached equal importance to the number of patients with transient or permanent morbidity, to the disease's economic impact as well as to its equity profile.An extreme change in directly related context to the choice assignment led to changes in stated preferences, although these changes were relatively small, given the extreme change in context.Priorities in the second DCE were even less aligned with cost-effectiveness analysis than those observed initially.",1
A multidisciplinary consensus statement on the optimal pharmacological treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). The addition of docetaxel or new hormone therapies (abiraterone, apalutamide, or enzalutamide) improves overall survival and is currently the standard of care. However, the decision on the specific regimen to accompany ADT should be discussed with the patient, considering factors such as possible associated toxicities, duration of treatment, comorbidities, patient preferences, as there is no sufficient evidence to recommend one regimen over the other in most cases. This paper summarizes the evidence on the management of mHSPC and provides consensus recommendations on the optimal treatment in combination with ADT in mHSPC patients, with special attention to the patient's clinical profile.",0
Colon Capsule Endoscopy - Shining the Light through the Colon.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) is a non-invasive, wireless capsule endoscope. In this article, we review its current applications, compare its performance with optical colonoscopy (OC) and alternative imaging modalities like CT colonography (CTC), and highlight developments that may increase potential future use. RECENT FINDINGS: By comparison to OC both CCE and CTC have a good sensitivity and specificity in detecting colonic polyps. CCE is more sensitive in detecting sub centimetre polyps. CCE is capable of detecting colonic inflammation and anorectal pathologies, commonly missed by CTC. However, rates of complete CCE examinations are limited by inadequate bowel preparation or incomplete colonic transit, whereas CTC can be performed with less bowel purgatives. Patients tolerate CCE better than OC, however patient preference between CCE and CTC vary. CCE and CTC are both reasonable alternatives to OC. Strategies to improve completion rates and adequacy of bowel preparation will improve cost and clinical effectiveness of CCE.",0
Materials and manufacturing techniques for occlusal splints: A literature review.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the materials and fabrications methods of occlusal splints with their advantages and shortcomings and to clarify the indications for each. BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) encompass a range of conditions affecting the masticatory system. Occlusal splints are currently recognised as a viable option for the management of TMDs when they are adopted in conjunction with additional approaches varying from conservative procedures (counselling, biofeedback, physical therapy, pharmacotherapy) to irreversible and less conservative ones (occlusal adjustments, orthodontics, arthroscopy and surgery). These splints can vary in design, function and material. The components used to fabricate the splints must withstand occlusal forces, be aesthetically pleasing, comfortable and minimally interfering with function and phonetics. Traditional methods for fabricating splints include sprinkle-on, thermoforming and lost wax techniques. However, with the advancement of CAD/CAM technology, additive (3D printing) and subtractive (milling) manufacturing methods expand the range of possibilities by introducing novel solutions for elaborating splints. METHODS: An electronic search was conducted on PubMed using the following keywords: ""occlusal splint"", ""guard and ""materials"", and ""manufacturing."" Thirteen in vitro publications were screened and they consisted of four clinical studies, nine reviews (three of them were systematic reviews), and five case reports. CONCLUSION: The choice of material is crucial for the success of splint therapy. Factors such as biocompatibility, ease of fabrication, adjustability, cost and patient preference should be considered. Newer materials and techniques are emerging because of advancements in material science and manufacturing techniques. However, it should be noted that most of the evidence is based on in vitro studies with different methodologies, limiting their validity in daily practice.",0

"Can the General Public Be a Proxy for an ""At-Risk"" Group in a Patient Preference Study? A Disease Prevention Example in Rheumatoid Arthritis.","BACKGROUND: When selecting samples for patient preference studies, it may be difficult or impractical to recruit participants who are eligible for a particular treatment decision. However, a general public sample may not be an appropriate proxy. OBJECTIVE: This study compares preferences for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) preventive treatments between members of the general public and first-degree relatives (FDRs) of confirmed RA patients to assess whether a sample of the general public can be used as a proxy for FDRs. METHODS: Participants were asked to imagine they were experiencing arthralgia and had screening tests indicating a 60% chance of developing RA within 2 yrs. Using a discrete choice experiment, participants were offered a series of choices between no treatment and 2 unlabeled hypothetical treatments to reduce the risk of RA. To assess data quality, time to complete survey sections and comprehension questions were assessed. A random parameter logit model was used to obtain attribute-level estimates, which were used to calculate relative importance, maximum acceptable risk (MAR), and market shares of hypothetical preventive treatments. RESULTS: The FDR sample (n = 298) spent more time completing the survey and performed better on comprehension questions compared with the general public sample (n = 982). The relative importance ranking was similar between the general public and FDR participant samples; however, other relative preference measures involving weights including MARs and market share differed between groups, with FDRs having numerically higher MARs. CONCLUSION: In the context of RA prevention, the general public (average risk) may be a reasonable proxy for a more at-risk sample (FDRs) for overall relative importance ranking but not weights. The rationale for a proxy sample should be clearly justified. HIGHLIGHTS: Participants from the general public were compared to first-degree relatives on their preferences for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) preventive treatments using a discrete choice experiment.Preferences were similar between groups in terms of the most important and least important attributes of preventive treatments, with effectiveness being the most important attribute. However, relative weights differed.Attention to the survey and predicted market shares of hypothetical RA preventive treatments differed between the general public and first-degree relatives.The general public may be a reasonable proxy for an at-risk group for patient preferences ranks but not weights in the disease prevention context; however, care should be taken in sample selection for patient preference studies when choosing nonpatients.",1
Perceptions of shared decision making in gastroenterology and inflammatory bowel disease: A qualitative analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Shared decision-making (SDM) is the partnership and discussion between clinicians and patients to make an appropriate decision based on scientific evidence and patient preferences. Many benefits are associated with SDM; however, little is known about its awareness or use by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) clinicians in gastroenterology departments across Israel. This study aims to identify barriers and facilitators in implementing SDM as standard practice to achieve optimal disease management and personalized care for patients with IBD. METHODS: Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with IBD clinicians across Israel to identify the barriers and facilitators for SDM use. An interview guide was developed, based on the systematic approach of the Theoretical Domain Framework (TDF). Interview transcripts were coded into theoretical domains to identify factors that may impact SDM. RESULTS: Sixteen gastroenterologists from nine different hospitals were interviewed. Common TDF domains that presented as barriers were: knowledge, skills, social/professional role and identity, environmental context and resources, and reinforcement. Most participants had never heard the precise term ""shared decision making"" and lacked formal training on SDM. CONCLUSION: This study identified key barriers and facilitators to SDM in IBD clinics across Israel. Main barriers of SDM include limited or nonexistent training; clinicians were unaware of SDM guidelines or techniques. The main facilitators of SDM were clinicians' social and professional role and identity and their beliefs about the influence of IBD and/or CD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: These influencing factors and TDF domains identified provide a basis for developing future interventions to improve the implementation of SDM within IBD management.",0
Exercise behaviours and motivation after a first psychotic episode: A digital intervention.,"AIM: Research has demonstrated that participation in aerobic exercise can have significant beneficial effects across both physical and mental health domains for individuals who are in the early phase of schizophrenia. Despite these notable benefits of exercise, deficits in motivation and a lack of methods to increase engagement are significant barriers for exercise participation, limiting these potentially positive effects. Fortunately, digital health tools have the potential to improve adherence to an exercise program. The present study examined the role of motivation for exercise and the effects of an automated digital text messaging program on participation in an aerobic exercise program. METHODS: A total of 46 first-episode psychosis participants from an ongoing 12-month randomized clinical trial (Enhancing Cognitive Training through Exercise Following a First Schizophrenia Episode (CT&E-RCT)) were included in an analysis to examine the efficacy of motivational text messaging. Personalized motivational text message reminders were sent to participants with the aim of increasing engagement in the exercise program. RESULTS: We found that participants with higher levels of intrinsic motivation to participate in a text messaging program and in an exercise intervention completed a higher proportion of individual, at-home exercise sessions. In a between groups analysis, participants who received motivational text messages, compared to those who did not, completed a higher proportion of at-home exercise sessions. CONCLUSION: These results indicate the importance of considering a person's level of motivation for exercise and the potential utility of using individualized and interactive mobile text messaging reminders to increase engagement in aerobic exercise in the early phase of psychosis. We emphasize the need for understanding how individualized patient preferences and needs interplay between intrinsic motivation and digital health interventions for young adults.",0
Evaluating the impact of interprofessional training wards on patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes: a mixed-methods analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Interprofessional teamwork is pivotal in modern healthcare, prompting the establishment of interprofessional training wards since 1996. While these wards serve as hubs for optimizing healthcare professional collaboration and communication, research into patient outcomes remains notably sparse and geographically limited, predominantly examining patient satisfaction and sparingly exploring other metrics like mortality or self-discharge rates. This study seeks to bridge this gap, comparing patient outcomes in interprofessional training wards and conventional wards under the hypothesis that the former offers no disadvantage to patient outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We explored patient outcomes within an interprofessional student ward called A-STAR at a University Hospital from October 2019 to December 2022. Engaging with patients discharged between May 2021 and April 2022, we utilized digital and paper-based anonymous questionnaires, catering to patient preference, to gather pertinent data. RESULTS: Analysis of outcomes for 1,482 A-STAR (interprofessional student ward) and 5,752 conventional ward patients revealed noteworthy findings. A-STAR patients tended to be younger (59 vs. 61 years, p < 0.01) and more frequently male (73.5% vs. 70.4%, p = 0.025). Vital clinical outcomes, such as discharges against medical advice, complication-driven readmissions, and ICU transfers, were statistically similar between groups, as were mortality rates (1.2% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.468). A-STAR demonstrated high patient satisfaction, underscored by positive reflections on team competence, ward atmosphere, and responsiveness to concerns, emphasizing the value placed on interprofessional collaboration. Patient narratives commended team kindness, lucid explanations, and proactive involvement. DISCUSSION: This data collectively underscores the safety and reliability of patient care within training wards, affirming that patients can trust the care provided in these settings. Patients on the interprofessional ward demonstrated high satisfaction levels: 96.7% appreciated the atmosphere and conduct of ward rounds. In comparison, 98.3% were satisfied with the discussion and information about their treatment during their hospital stay.",0
DEXTENZA versus Topical Steroid or Antihistamine Therapy for Treatment of Allergic Conjunctivitis.,"PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes and patient preference for the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (DEX) versus topical loteprednol (LOT) or olopatadine (OLO) for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in a real-world model of allergen exposure. METHODS: This was a prospective comparative trial. Adults with testing-confirmed bilateral allergic conjunctivitis received DEX in the more symptomatic eye and either LOT 2 times daily or OLO once daily for 30 days in the fellow eye. The primary outcome was patient preference for treatment. Clinical outcomes included ocular itching and hyperemia, lid swelling, and watering/tearing. Safety outcomes included intraocular pressure (IOP). RESULTS: Thirty patients participated and completed the study. All received DEX in the eye with worse symptoms and 15 received LOT and the other 15 received OLO in the other eye. Patients preferred DEX (10/15; 66.7%) over LOT (4/15; 26.7%), with one patient having no preference (p = 0.0103). Patients had no preference between DEX (8/15; 53.3%) and OLO (6/15; 40%), with one patient having no preference (p = 0.1044). In the DEX/LOT cohort, ocular itching and hyperemia improved more with DEX than LOT (p ≤ 0.009), while in the DEX/OLO cohort, the DEX eyes showed greater improvement in conjunctival hyperemia (p < 0.0001) but not itching (p = 0.074). No between-group differences were seen in eyelid swelling or tearing/watering in either cohort. Mean change in IOP was similar between the DEX and LOT eyes (p = 0.4921), and mean IOP rose more in the DEX eyes than the OLO eyes (by <1 mmHg; p = 0.0403). CONCLUSION: Overall, this real-world study demonstrated that the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert was as effective as a topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer and more effective than topical steroids in relieving the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. This insert should be considered as an alternative to topical therapy for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.",0
Differences in Preferences for Drug Therapy Between Patients with Metastatic Versus Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Systematic Literature Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Compared with early stages (eBC) metastatic BC (mBC) is incurable. In mBC, aggressive treatment may increase the duration of survival but may also cause severe treatment side effects. A better understanding how patients with BC value different aspects of drug therapy might improve treatment effectiveness, satisfaction and adherence. This systematic review aims to identify and summarise studies evaluating patient preferences for drug therapy of BC and to compare preferences of patients with eBC and mBC. METHODS: The systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The electronic databases PubMed and Web of Science were searched on 22 June 2023. All studies published to this point were considered. Original studies reporting patient preferences on BC drug therapy determined by any type of choice experiment were eligible. A narrative synthesis of the effect measures presented as relative importance ratings, trade-offs (required benefit to make a therapy worthwhile) or monetary values of the treatment attributes was reported for each study. Risk of bias assessment for individual studies was performed using the checklist for observational studies from the STROBE Statement and the checklist from 'Conducting Discrete Choice Experiments to Inform Healthcare Decision Making: A User's Guide'. The study protocol was registered at the PROSPERO database (CRD42022377031). RESULTS: A total of 34 studies met the inclusion criteria were included in the analysis evaluating the preferences of patients with eBC (n = 18), mBC (n = 10) or any stage BC (n = 6) on, for example, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, hormonal therapy or CKD4/6-inhibitors using different types of choice experiments. Regardless of the stage, most patients valued treatment effectiveness in terms of survival gains higher than potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Treatment cost, mode of administration, treatment regimen and monitoring aspects were considered as least important treatment attributes. In addition, preferences concerning 16 different types of ADRs were described, showing high heterogeneity within BC stages. Yet, comparable results across BC stages were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the stage, patients with BC consistently valued survival gains as the most important attribute and were willing to accept the risk of potential ADRs. Incorporating patient preferences in shared decision making may improve the effectiveness of interventions by enhancing adherence to drug therapy in patients suffering from BC.",1
Treatment preferences towards thrombopoietin-receptor agonists for immune thrombocytopenia and experience of disease (TRAPeze): Italy cohort.,"OBJECTIVE: Identify patient preference towards thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) and determine the clinical and social impact of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in Italy. METHODS: The Thrombopoietin-Receptor Agonist Patient experience (TRAPeze) survey collected responses from Italian residents from 17th January to 28th February 2022. TRAPeze utilized a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit patient preferences towards TPO-RA attributes and a patient burden survey (PBS) to determine ITP disease characteristics and social impact. RESULTS: Seventy-six respondents completed the DCE, of which 69 completed both the DCE and PBS (mean [range] age 45 [18.0-73.0] years, 80% female). TPO-RA attributes with the greatest influence over respondent choice were method of administration (odds ratio [OR] 2.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.16-4.06), drug-food interactions (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.17-1.86) and frequency of dosing (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.15-1.52). Respondents were more likely to prefer therapies administered orally over subcutaneous injection (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.51-5.63), once weekly over once daily (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.26-2.65), and therapies without food restrictions over with restrictions (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.17-2.14).The most frequently reported symptoms were bruising (82%), petechiae (65%) and fatigue (64%). Most respondents (84%) felt ITP impacted familial relationships and 71% of employed respondents reported fatigue influencing their ability to work, with 31% reducing working hours. CONCLUSION: Although responses indicated a moderate perception of general health, ITP clearly impacted respondent work and social life. Our findings demonstrate respondents preferred TPO-RAs delivered orally, with less frequent dosing and without food restrictions.",1
How Physicians Tackle Internet-Misinformed Patients: Going Beyond Traditional Patient-Centered Communication - A Study Protocol.,"BACKGROUND: The proliferation of misleading and irrelevant health information on the Internet has become a significant public concern. Inappropriate use of online materials can cause harm to patients' health and quality of life. While close attention has been paid to health campaigns and education programs that aim to disseminate accurate health knowledge, the role of physicians, who directly communicate with patients in medical encounters and provide personalized information, has been overlooked. Therefore, this study focuses on physicians and their communication strategies with internet-misinformed patients (IMPs). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the communicative strategies physicians use to tackle IMPs and explore connections between physicians' communicative strategies and patient-centered communication. METHODS: Approximately 10 to 15 physicians from diverse cultural backgrounds, including Ticino (an Italian-speaking region in Switzerland), Milan and China will be interviewed. Interviews will be conducted in-person or online through video conferencing software programs. Physicians will be asked about their experiences with IMPs, communicative strategies for addressing patients' misconceptions, balancing patient preferences, decision-making obstacles, and envisioning an ideal relationship with them. A thematic analysis will be utilized to analyze data, employing a general inductive approach. DISCUSSION: The results will provide valuable insights into effective clinical communication strategies that address patients' misuse of internet materials and inform policymakers and healthcare providers about the limitations and applicability of patient-centered communication in the current digital era.",0
How should respiratory depression and loss of airway patency be handled during initiation of palliative sedation?,BACKGROUND: Loss of airway patency has been reported during initiation of palliative sedation. In present guidelines the loss of airway patency during initiation of palliative sedation is not addressed. Airway patency can be restored by jaw thrust/chin lift or placing the patient in the recovery position. AIM: A structured ethical analysis of how respiratory depression and loss of airway patency during initiation of palliative sedation should be handled. The essence of the dilemma is whether it is appropriate to apply simple non-invasive methods to restore airway patency in order to avoid the patient's immediate death. DESIGN: A structured analysis based on the four principles of healthcare ethics and stakeholders' interests. RESULTS: Beneficence and autonomy support a decision not to regain airway patency whereas non-maleficence lends weight to a decision to restore airway patency. Whether the proportionality criterion of the principle of double effect is met depends on the features of the individual case. The ethical problem appears to be a genuine dilemma where important values and arguments point to different conclusions. CONCLUSION: Whether to restore airway patency when the airway is obstructed during initiation of palliative sedation will ultimately be based on clinical judgment taking into account both any known patient preferences and relevant clinical information. There are strong arguments favoring both options in this clinical and ethical dilemma. The fact that a clear and universal recommendation cannot be made does not imply indifference regarding what is the clinically and ethically best option for each individual patient.,0
Describing settings of care in the last 100 days of life for cancer decedents: a population-based descriptive study.,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have described the settings cancer decedents spend their end-of-life stage, with none considering homecare specifically. We describe the different settings of care experienced in the last 100 days of life by individuals with cancer and how settings of care change as they approached death. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study from January 2013 to December 2017, of decedents whose primary cause of death was cancer, using linked population-level health administrative datasets in Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: Decedents 125,755 were included in our cohort. The average age at death was 73, 46% were female, and 14% resided in rural regions. And 24% died of lung cancer, 7% breast, 7% colorectal, 7% pancreatic, 5% prostate, and 50% other cancers. In the last 100 days of life, decedents spent 25.9 days in institutions, 25.8 days receiving care in the community, and 48.3 days at home without any care. Individuals who died of lung and pancreatic cancers spent the most days at home without any care (52.1 and 52.6 days), while individuals who died of prostate and breast cancer spent the least days at home without any care (41.6 and 45.1 days). Regardless of cancer type, decedents spent fewer days at home and more days in institutions as they approached death, despite established patient preferences for an end-of-life experience at home. CONCLUSIONS: In the last 100 days of life, cancer decedents spent most of their time in either institutions or at home without any care. Improving homecare services during the end-of-life may provide people dying of cancer with a preferred dying experience.",0
Roadmap for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension in the Middle East: Review of the 2022 EVIDENT Summit.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension are leading risk factors for death and disability in the Middle East. Both conditions are highly prevalent, underdiagnosed and poorly controlled, highlighting an urgent need for a roadmap to overcome the barriers to optimal glycaemic and blood pressure management in this region. This review provides a summary of the Evidence in Diabetes and Hypertension Summit (EVIDENT) held in September 2022, which discussed current treatment guidelines, unmet clinical needs and strategies to improve treatment outcomes for patients with T2DM and hypertension in the Middle East. Current clinical guidelines recommend strict glycaemic and blood pressure targets, presenting several treatment options to achieve and maintain these targets and prevent complications. However, treatment targets are infrequently met in the Middle East, largely due to high clinical inertia among physicians and low medication adherence among patients. To address these challenges, clinical guidelines now provide individualised therapy recommendations based on drug profiles, patient preferences and management priorities. Efforts to improve the early detection of prediabetes, T2DM screening and intensive, early glucose control will minimise long-term complications. Physicians can use the T2DM Oral Agents Fact Checking programme to help navigate the wide range of treatment options and guide clinical decision-making. Sulfonylurea agents have been used successfully to manage T2DM; a newer agent, gliclazide MR (modified release formulation), has the advantages of a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia with no risk of cardiovascular events, weight neutrality and proven renal benefits. For patients with hypertension, single-pill combinations have been developed to improve efficacy and reduce treatment burden. In conjunction with pragmatic treatment algorithms and personalised therapies, greater investments in disease prevention, public awareness, training of healthcare providers, patient education, government policies and research are needed to improve the quality of care of patients with T2DM and/or hypertension in the Middle East.",0
"Clinical practice guidelines of the Japan Research Committee of the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare for Intractable Vasculitis for the management of microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis: The 2023 update - secondary publica","OBJECTIVE: To revise the 2017 clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for the management of microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) to reflect advancements in the field. METHODS: Similar to the 2017 CPG, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system was adopted for this revision. The intended users of this CPG include patients diagnosed with MPA or GPA in Japan and their families and healthcare professionals, including specialists and non-specialists. Based on a scoping review, four clinical questions (CQs) of the 2017 guidelines were modified, and six new CQs were added. RESULTS: We suggest a combination of glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide or rituximab for remission induction therapy. In cases where cyclophosphamide or rituximab is used, we suggest the use of avacopan over high-dose glucocorticoid. Furthermore, we suggest against the use of plasma exchange in addition to the standard treatment in severe cases of MPA/GPA. Finally, we suggest the use of glucocorticoid and rituximab over glucocorticoid and azathioprine for remission maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations have been updated based on patient preference, certainty of evidence, benefit and risk balance, and cost.",0
Risk Stratification of Cardiovascular Disease according to Age Groups in New Prevention Guidelines: A Review.,"Age is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, most cardiovascular risk prediction models have included age as an independent risk factor. There is much evidence that effective management of cardiovascular risk factors improves clinical outcomes even in older adults. However, there are concerns that intensive treatment for older adults increases the risk of adverse events. For hypertensive patients, intensive blood pressure reduction with combination therapy increases the risk of syncope, acute kidney injury, and falls. Intensive glucose-lowering therapy among older patients with diabetes increases the risk of hypoglycemia or cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that a balanced approach for older adults is required to increase the benefits and decrease the risk of side effects. In contrast to older people, the estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk in young and healthy individuals is low. However, the lifetime cardiovascular risk in these patients is actually high. The 2021 European Society of Cardiology guideline on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice has been published. It proposed a different risk stratification and recommendation for treatment according to age group, based on the concept of avoiding undertreatment in young people and overtreatment in older persons. Although the guideline recommends age-dependent risk stratification, risk categories should not be applied to the mandatory initiation of drug treatment. In all age groups, other factors such as lifetime cardiovascular risk, treatment benefit and harm, comorbidities, frailty, and patient preferences should be considered when managing patients for primary prevention.",0
Patient preferences for key drivers and facilitators of adoption of mHealth technology to manage depression: A discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: In time, we may be able to detect the early onset of symptoms of depression and even predict relapse using behavioural data gathered through mobile technologies. However, barriers to adoption exist and understanding the importance of these factors to users is vital to ensure maximum adoption. METHOD: In a discrete choice experiment, people with a history of depression (N = 171) were asked to select their preferred technology from a series of vignettes containing four characteristics: privacy, clinical support, established benefit and device accuracy (i.e., ability to detect symptoms), with different levels. Mixed logit models were used to establish what was most likely to affect adoption. Sub-group analyses explored effects of age, gender, education, technology acceptance and familiarity, and nationality. RESULTS: Higher level of privacy, greater clinical support, increased perceived benefit and better device accuracy were important. Accuracy was the most important, with only modest compromises willing to be made to increase other factors such as privacy. Established benefit was the least valued of the attributes with participants happy with technology that had possible but unknown benefits. Preferences were moderated by technology acceptance, age, nationality, and educational background. CONCLUSION: For people with a history of depression, adoption of technology may be driven by the desire for accurate detection of symptoms. However, people with lower technology acceptance and educational attainment, those who were younger, and specific nationalities may be willing to compromise on some accuracy for more privacy and clinical support. These preferences should help shape design of mHealth tools.",1
Early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy in patients with cancer who have low-risk neutropenic sepsis: the EASI-SWITCH RCT.,"BACKGROUND: Neutropenic sepsis is a common complication of systemic anticancer treatment. There is variation in practice in timing of switch to oral antibiotics after commencement of empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy. OBJECTIVES: To establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of early switch to oral antibiotics in patients with neutropenic sepsis at low risk of infective complications. DESIGN: A randomised, multicentre, open-label, allocation concealed, non-inferiority trial to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of early oral switch in comparison to standard care. SETTING: Nineteen UK oncology centres. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 16 years and over receiving systemic anticancer therapy with fever (≥ 38°C), or symptoms and signs of sepsis, and neutropenia (≤ 1.0 × 10(9)/l) within 24 hours of randomisation, with a Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer score of ≥ 21 and receiving intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam or meropenem for < 24 hours were eligible. Patients with acute leukaemia or stem cell transplant were excluded. INTERVENTION: Early switch to oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice daily) and co-amoxiclav (625 mg three times daily) within 12-24 hours of starting intravenous antibiotics to complete 5 days treatment in total. Control was standard care, that is, continuation of intravenous antibiotics for at least 48 hours with ongoing treatment at physician discretion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment failure, a composite measure assessed at day 14 based on the following criteria: fever persistence or recurrence within 72 hours of starting intravenous antibiotics; escalation from protocolised antibiotics; critical care support or death. RESULTS: The study was closed early due to under-recruitment with 129 patients recruited; hence, a definitive conclusion regarding non-inferiority cannot be made. Sixty-five patients were randomised to the early switch arm and 64 to the standard care arm with subsequent intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses including 125 (intervention n = 61 and control n = 64) and 113 (intervention n = 53 and control n = 60) patients, respectively. In the intention-to-treat population the treatment failure rates were 14.1% in the control group and 24.6% in the intervention group, difference = 10.5% (95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.22). In the per-protocol population the treatment failure rates were 13.3% and 17.7% in control and intervention groups, respectively; difference = 3.7% (95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.148). Treatment failure predominantly consisted of persistence or recurrence of fever and/or physician-directed escalation from protocolised antibiotics with no critical care admissions or deaths. The median length of stay was shorter in the intervention group and adverse events reported were similar in both groups. Patients, particularly those with care-giving responsibilities, expressed a preference for early switch. However, differences in health-related quality of life and health resource use were small and not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Non-inferiority for early oral switch could not be proven due to trial under-recruitment. The findings suggest this may be an acceptable treatment strategy for some patients who can adhere to such a treatment regimen and would prefer a potentially reduced duration of hospitalisation while accepting increased risk of treatment failure resulting in re-admission. Further research should explore tools for patient stratification for low-risk de-escalation or ambulatory pathways including use of biomarkers and/or point-of-care rapid microbiological testing as an adjunct to clinical decision-making tools. This could include application to shorter-duration antimicrobial therapy in line with other antimicrobial stewardship studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered as ISRCTN84288963.

"Validation of the Cooper-Norcross Inventory of Preferences (C-NIP) in Chinese lay clients and mental health professionals: Factor structure, measurement invariance, and scale differences.","The Cooper-Norcross Inventory of Preferences (C-NIP) is one of the most widely used measures of psychotherapy preferences. However, its psychometric properties have not been examined in non-Western samples. Research on disparities between the preferences of mental health professionals and their clients is also limited. We evaluated the C-NIP's psychometric properties and measurement invariance in Chinese lay clients and mental health professionals and evaluated the latent mean differences between clients' and professionals' scores on the C-NIP's four scales (preference for therapist vs. client directiveness, emotional intensity vs. emotional reserve, past vs. present orientation, and warm support vs. focused challenge). This cross-sectional investigation involved 301 lay clients and 856 mental health professionals who completed the Chinese version of the C-NIP. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) were used to examine the factor structure of the C-NIP. ESEM provided stronger evidence than CFA for the four-factor model in both samples. The four scales had adequate internal consistency in both the lay clients (αs = .68-.89) and the mental health professionals (αs = .70-.80). Partial scalar invariance was established across these two populations. Chinese mental health professionals preferred less therapist directiveness, past orientation, and warm support-but more emotional intensity-than Chinese lay clients (ds = 0.25-0.90). Culture-specific cutoff values (norms) to identify strong therapy preferences were established. This study supports the application of the C-NIP to non-Western populations and suggests that discrepancies between the preferences of lay clients and mental health professionals are a cross-cultural phenomenon.

Safety outcomes and patients' preferences for home-based intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in pompe disease and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) disorder: COVID-19 and beyond.,"BACKGROUND: The Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) demands precise information on benefit/risk profile of home-based enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of patients with Pompe disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). This passage is necessary to obtain the authorization for ERT home therapy, even after the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic period. This research intends to evaluate the safety, treatment satisfaction, and compliance of MPS I patients treated with laronidase (Aldurazyme®) and Pompe Disease patients treated with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme®) in a homecare setting. RESULTS: We report herein an early interim analysis of the HomERT (Home infusions of ERT) study, a multicenter, non-interventional, double-cohort study that retrospectively analyzed 38 patients from 14 sites in Italy: cohort A (Pompe disease - 32 patients) and cohort B (MPS I - 6 patients). Among the selected patients who started home therapy before enrollment, the average number of missed home-based infusions was 0.7 (1.3) in cohort A and 3.8 (6.4) in cohort B with no return to the hospital setting. Irrespective of the treatment location, 3 prior ADRs per cohort were reported. The majority of patients preferred home-based infusions (cohort A: 96.9%; cohort B: 100%): the main reason was attributed to treatment convenience (cohort A: 81.3%; cohort B: 83.3%). Despite the underlying conditions, most patients self-evaluated their health as ""good"" (cohort A: 50%; cohort B: 83.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of favorable safety profile, improved treatment compliance and personal satisfaction validates the use of ERT with laronidase and alglucosidase alfa as a strong candidate for home therapy.",0
"Acceptability of patient-centered, multi-disciplinary medication therapy management recommendations: results from the INCREASE randomized study.","BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy and inappropriate medications may be a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Medication therapy management (MTM) interventions may mitigate medication-induced cognitive dysfunction and delay onset of symptomatic impairment. The objective of the current study is to describe an MTM protocol for a patient-centered team intervention (pharmacist and non-pharmacist clinician) in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) directed at delaying the symptomatic onset of ADRD. METHODS: Community dwelling adults 65 + years, non-demented, using ≥ 1 potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) were enrolled in an RCT to evaluate the effect of an MTM intervention on improving medication appropriateness and cognition (NCT02849639). The MTM intervention involved a three-step process: (1) pharmacist identified potential medication-related problems (MRPs) and made initial recommendations for prescribed and over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements; (2) study team reviewed all initial recommendations together with the participants, allowing for revisions prior to the finalized recommendations; (3) participant responses to final recommendations were recorded. Here, we describe initial recommendations, changes during team engagement, and participant responses to final recommendations. RESULTS: Among the 90 participants, a mean 6.7 ± 3.6 MRPs per participant were reported. Of the 259 initial MTM recommendations made for the treatment group participants (N = 46), 40% percent underwent revisions in the second step. Participants reported willingness to adopt 46% of final recommendations and expressed need for additional primary care input in response to 38% of final recommendations. Willingness to adopt final recommendations was highest when therapeutic switches were offered and/or with anticholinergic medications. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of modifications to MTM recommendations demonstrated that pharmacists' initial MTM recommendations often changed following the participation in the multidisciplinary decision-making process that incorporated patient preferences. The team was encouraged to see a correlation between engaging patients and a positive overall response towards participant acceptance of final MTM recommendations.

The role of topical therapies along the psoriasis patient journey: An overview from the Symposium 'Tailoring topical psoriasis treatments to patients' needs and expectations' of the 30(th) EADV Congress 2021.,"This article summarizes a presentation titled 'The role of topical therapies along the psoriasis patient journey' held at the Satellite Symposium of the 30(th) European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress. During this session, the role of topical treatments in the management of psoriasis was presented, with a particular focus on the current unmet needs and data gaps. Psoriasis plays a significant role in a patient's daily life, impacting them not only physically but also psychologically and socially. The disease burden increases with duration and severity. Topical therapies are the keystone of the management of psoriasis. About 70%-80% of patients present a mild-to-moderate form of psoriasis that can be successfully treated with topical agents. According to a German recommendation, patients with mild psoriasis should initiate a topical therapy in combination with skin care products. In the real-life setting, the calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (CAL/BDP) fixed combination was the most prescribed topical treatment for beyond-mild patients in Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. Healthcare professionals also often or very often prescribed topicals as an alternative to non-biologic systemics in certain situations, such as patient preference (51%), contraindication (50%) and to limit side effects (26%). Adjunctive topical therapy to patients using systemic therapy is used to optimize treatment outcomes and improving the quality of life for patients. Topical treatments can be also effective in severe forms of psoriasis. However, there are still some gaps and unmet needs on topical therapy. Ineffectiveness, patient dissatisfaction and adherence are the largest barriers to treatment success. Main strengths of topical treatments include the availability of various topical ingredients and galenics, the adaptability to different anatomical areas and the possible combination with phototherapy and systemics. Moreover, patients in specific situations can benefit from switching to topical treatments (e.g. pregnancy or surgery).",0
Preferences of pregnant individuals to undergo labor after one cesarean in southern China.,"BACKGROUND: Labor after cesarean (LAC) remains an optional delivery method among healthy pregnant individuals. Exploring women's attitudes, preferences, reasons for previous cesarean delivery, and the incentives underlying pregnant individuals' preferences could help us understand their choice of delivery mode. In this study we evaluated the preferences and attitudes of eligible pregnant women regarding participation in a LAC in Foshan, China. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 438 pregnant individuals with one prior cesarean delivery (CD) who attended their antenatal examination at a tertiary hospital in southern China, between November 1, 2018, and October 31, 2019. Information on demographic characteristics, obstetric data, preferences for LAC, and incentives for LAC were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 85.4% (374/438) of women preferred LAC if they did not have contraindications before delivery, whereas 12.3% (54/438) refused and 2.3% (10/438) were unsure. Participants reported that the most important factors affecting their willingness to undergo LAC were safety indicators (i.e., ""ability of hospitals to perform emergency cesarean delivery"" [score of 9.28 ± 1.86]), followed by accessibility indicators (i.e., ""priority bed arrangements"" [score of 9.17 ± 1.84]). Logistic regression analysis indicated that neonatal wellbeing with the prior CD was an independent influencing factor (OR = 2.235 [95%CI: 1.115-4.845], p = 0.024) affecting willingness to access LAC in the subsequent pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high preference for LAC among pregnant individuals without contraindications before delivery in southern China. Healthcare providers need to ensure access to LAC and increase pregnant individuals' LAC willingness through high-quality shared decsision-making in alignment with patient preferences.",0
Active surveillance versus treatment in low-risk DCIS: Women's preferences in the LORD-trial.,"BACKGROUND: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) can progress to invasive breast cancer (IBC), but most DCIS lesions remain indolent. However, guidelines recommend surgery, often supplemented by radiotherapy. This implies overtreatment of indolent DCIS. The non-randomised patient preference LORD-trial tests whether active surveillance (AS) for low-risk DCIS is safe, by giving women with low-risk DCIS a choice between AS and conventional treatment (CT). Here, we aim to describe how participants are distributed among both trial arms, identify their motives for their preference, and assess factors associated with their choice. METHODS: Data were extracted from baseline questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the distribution and characteristics of participants; thematic analyses to extract self-reported reasons for the choice of trial arm, and multivariable logistic regression analyses to investigate associations between patient characteristics and chosen trial arm. RESULTS: Of 377 women included, 76% chose AS and 24% CT. Most frequently cited reasons for AS were ""treatment is not (yet) necessary"" (59%) and trust in the AS-plan (39%). Reasons for CT were cancer worry (51%) and perceived certainty (29%). Women opting for AS more often had lower educational levels (OR 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.93) and more often reported experiencing shared decision making (OR 2.71; 95% CI, 1.37-5.37) than women choosing CT. CONCLUSION: The LORD-trial is the first to offer women with low-risk DCIS a choice between CT and AS. Most women opted for AS and reported high levels of trust in the safety of AS. Their preferences highlight the necessity to establish the safety of AS for low-risk DCIS.",0
Learning From Clinical Supervisor Practice Variability: Exploring Medical Resident and Fellow Experiences and Interpretations.,"PURPOSE: Clinical practice variability is characterized by 2 or more clinicians making different treatment decisions despite encountering a similar case. This study explores how medical residents and fellows experience and interpret intersupervisor clinical practice variability and how these variations influence learning. METHOD: Seventeen senior residents or fellows in internal medicine, hematology, or thrombosis medicine (postgraduate year 3 or above) participated in semistructured interviews after a clinical rotation in thrombosis medicine from December 2019 to March 2021. Data collection and analysis occurred iteratively and concurrently in a manner consistent with constructivist grounded theory. Variation theory was used to guide the development of some interview questions. A central tenet of this theory is that learning occurs by experiencing 3 sequential patterns of variation: contrast, generalization, and fusion. Participants were recruited purposively with respect to specialty until theoretical sufficiency was reached. RESULTS: Clinical practice variability was experienced by all participants. Residents and fellows attributed practice variability to intrinsic differences among supervisors; interinstitutional differences; selection and interpretation of evidence; patient preferences, priorities, and fears; and their own participation in the decision-making process. Clinical practice variability helped residents and fellows discern key features of cases that influenced decision-making (contrast), group similar cases so that the appropriate evidence could be applied (generalization), and develop attitudes consistent with providing individualized patient care (fusion). Observing practice variability was more helpful for fifth- and sixth-year residents and less helpful for third- and fourth-year residents. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practice variability helped residents and fellows discern critical aspects, group similar patients, and practice individualized medicine. Future research should characterize how clinical practice variability influences learning across the spectrum of training, how supervisors could encourage learning from practice variability, and how curricula could be modified to allow learners greater opportunity to reflect on and consolidate the practice differences they observe.",0
A qualitative study of teleconsultation practices among French oncologists in a post-COVID-19 period.,"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted healthcare professionals to adapt and implement new tools to ensure continuity of patient care. Teleconsultation became the only option for some practitioners who had never used it previously and boosted its use for others who already used it. Several studies have reviewed the use of teleconsultation in oncology during the epidemic, but few have addressed its continued use and how practitioners view it in a post-epidemic period. The aim of this survey was to conduct a qualitative exploration of how oncologists use teleconsultation in their daily practice in a post-COVID 19 period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this qualitative study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with oncologists in France who utilized teleconsultation in the field of oncology during the COVID-19 period. The interview guide included questions on the interests and limitations of using teleconsultation in oncology, on reluctance to use it among oncologists, and invited participants to formulate proposals for more optimal use. RESULTS: Fourteen oncologists participated in the survey. Currently, 12% of the consultations of the surveyed practitioners are conducted via teleconsultation. Seven themes were identified in the analysis of the interviews: (a) The oncologist and teleconsultation; (b) Clinical motivations for using teleconsultation; (c) Comparison between teleconsultation and in-person consultation; (d) Advantages and disadvantages of teleconsultation; (e) Technical modalities of teleconsultation; (f) Role of Covid and confinement in the use of teleconsultation; (h) Epistemic judgments about teleconsultation. Optimal teleconsultation occurs when seamlessly incorporated into patient care, offering reduced patient inconvenience, and providing economic and environmental benefits. Although there's a lack of unified agreement in research literature regarding time efficiency, teleconsultation facilitates more customized patient monitoring and addresses the challenge of ""medical deserts"" nationally. Considering patient preferences is crucial when contemplating the use of teleconsultation. Predominantly, technical issues stand as the principal barriers to teleconsultation implementation. CONCLUSION: Even after the end of the health crisis, teleconsultation is still used in clinical practice. Recommendations for effective use are suggested.",0
Understanding Intraoperative Transfusion Decision-Making Variability: A Qualitative Study.,"There is evidence of significant intraoperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion variability that cannot be explained by case-mix, and may reflect unwarranted transfusions. The objective was to explore the source of intraoperative RBC transfusion variability by eliciting the beliefs of anesthesiologists and surgeons that underlie transfusion decisions. Interviews based on the Theoretical Domains Framework were conducted to identify beliefs about intraoperative transfusion. Content analysis was performed to group statements into domains. Relevant domains were selected based on frequency of beliefs, perceived influence on transfusion, and the presence of conflicting beliefs within domains. Of the 28 transfusion experts recruited internationally (16 anesthesiologists, 12 surgeons), 24 (86%) were Canadian or American and 11 (39%) identified as female. Eight relevant domains were identified: (1) Knowledge (insufficient evidence to guide intraoperative transfusion), (2) Social/professional role and identity (surgeons/anesthesiologists share responsibility for transfusions), (3) Beliefs about consequences (concerns about morbidity of transfusion/anemia), (4) Environmental context/resources (transfusions influenced by type of surgery, local blood supply, cost of transfusion), (5) Social influences (institutional culture, judgment by peers, surgeon-anesthesiologist relationship, patient preference influencing transfusion decisions), (6) Behavioral regulation (need for intraoperative transfusion guidelines, usefulness of audits and educational sessions to guide transfusion), (7) Nature of the behaviors (overtransfusion remains commonplace, transfusion practice becoming more restrictive over time), and (8) Memory, attention, and decision processes (various patient and operative characteristics are incorporated into transfusion decisions). This study identified a range of factors underlying intraoperative transfusion decision-making and partly explain the variability in transfusion behavior. Targeted theory-informed behavior-change interventions derived from this work could help reduce intraoperative transfusion variability.",0
HTA community perspectives on the use of patient preference information: lessons learned from a survey with members of HTA bodies.,"This research sought to assess whether and how patient preference (PP) data are currently used within health technology assessment (HTA) bodies and affiliated organizations involved in technology/drug appraisals and assessments. An exploratory survey was developed by the PP Project Subcommittee of the HTA International Patient and Citizen Involvement Interest Group to gain insight into the use, impact, and role of PP data in HTA, as well as the perceived barriers to its incorporation. Forty members of HTA bodies and affiliated organizations from twelve countries completed the online survey. PP data were reported to be formally considered as part of the HTA evidence review process by 82.5 percent of the respondents, while 39.4 percent reported that most of the appraisals and assessments within their organization in the past year had submitted PP data. The leading reason for why PP data were not submitted in most assessments was time/resource constraints followed by lack of clarity on PP data impact. Participants reported that PP data had a moderate level of influence on the deliberative process and outcome of the decision, but a higher level of influence on the decision's quality. Most (81.8 percent) felt patient advocacy groups should be primarily responsible for generating and submitting this type of evidence. Insights from the survey confirm the use of PP data in HTA but reveal barriers to its broader and more meaningful integration. Encouragingly, participants believe obstacles can be overcome, paving the way for a second phase of research involving in-depth collaborative workshops with HTA representatives.",0
Experiences of patients and next of kin on informed consent process for emergency surgery in two Urban university teaching hospitals in Uganda: a comparative cross sectional study.,"Informed consent for emergency surgery is a process in which a patient or their next of kin must make quick decisions required for surgery in a life-threatening situation or surgery that may have life-altering outcomes. The objective of the study was to describe patients and their next of kin experiences and factors influencing the informed consent process in two urban university teaching hospitals in Uganda. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey involving patients who underwent emergency surgery and their next of kin was conducted in two tertiary care hospitals; one public and one private-not-for profit institution. A questionnaire was administered to collect sociodemographic information, type of Surgery that was done, how informed consent was obtained and experiences and expectations from the informed consent process. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the variables was done. RESULTS: We collected data from 210 patients from a public hospital and 170 from a private-not-for profit hospital. Overall, most patients did not have the risks of the surgery communicated to them (79.7%), were not given alternative options (87.6%) and had no opportunity to ask questions (57.4%). Patients at the private institution had 3.35 times the odds of expecting the consent form to be explained to them than those at the public institution. Patients at the public hospital had 0.12 times the odds of preferring to have consent administered by a nurse than patients at the private institution OR 0.12 (0.05-0.29, p < 0.001). Patients in the public institution had 0.18 times the odds of preferring to have consent administered by a doctor than patients in the private institution OR 0.18 (0.08-0.45, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients in both public and private institutions are not informed about the risks of surgery, alternative options and are not given the opportunity to ask questions. Interpretation of the findings of this study on patient preferences on who administered consent though statistically significant were inconclusive due to the responses not being mutually exclusive.",0
Sequencing Systemic Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Multiple treatment options are now approved for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-containing regimen should be highly considered as the first-line treatment when there is no contraindication, especially in those with hepatitis virus-related HCC, due to proven superior overall survival (OS) compared to sorafenib. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab remain the treatment of choice among all ICI-containing regimens, unless contraindications to either of the medications exist. Although sorafenib is still the only medication currently approved for select patients with Child-Pugh B (CP) HCC in the first-line setting, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is being studied in this patient population. Moreover, patients with post-liver transplantation recurrence may benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), while more studies are still needed to determine the safety of ICIs in this setting. Interestingly, multiple potential biomarkers, including tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI) status, and PD-L1 expression level, have inconsistently predicted response to ICIs in patients with HCC. Limited evidence is available to guide treatment choice in later-line settings after progressing on ICIs, and decisions should be based on the safety profile of the treatment regimen and patient preference. Multiple trials are ongoing to elucidate the optimal treatment sequence. Of note, we believe that TKIs (e.g., cabozantinib, regorafenib, lenvatinib, and sorafenib) could be more beneficial in later-line settings to broaden inhibition of other pathways apart from vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). When conventional treatment options are exhausted, tissue biopsy may be helpful to reveal rare targetable mutations, such as RET gene fusions.",0
Utility of Platelet-Rich Plasma Therapy in the Management of Meniscus Injuries: A narrative review.,"Menisci are crucial for knee joint functions and meniscal tears are common injuries, especially in sports activities. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which enhances healing, has emerged as a promising additive treatment for meniscus injuries, utilizing the regenerative properties of platelets and growth factors for improved clinical outcomes. In studies with a follow-up period of less than one year, the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy for meniscus injuries showed significant improvements in knee symptoms and daily activity. Patients experienced enhanced outcomes in terms of pain reduction and increased sports activity, with MRI scans indicating stable meniscus conditions after six months. Studies with a follow-up of more than one year, however, did not find significant differences between groups treated with PRP and groups not treated with PRP in terms of various outcome measures, including pain and knee function. The vascularization of the menisci is vital for their proper function, and insufficient blood supply can affect healing of meniscal injuries. PRP therapy is used to enhance meniscal healing by introducing growth factors and anti-inflammatory agents. PRP therapy may enable athletes with meniscal tears to return to sports more quickly and has less rehabilitation duration. While PRP seems promising as an alternative to failed treatment or as an adjunct to treatment in the short term, its long-term effectiveness remains inconclusive. Patient preferences, commitment to therapy rehabilitation, and cost should all be considered on an individual basis.",0
Use of Patient Preferences Data Regarding Multiple Risks to Inform Regulatory Decisions.,"Background and Objectives. Risk-tolerance measures from patient-preference studies typically focus on individual adverse events. We recently introduced an approach that extends maximum acceptable risk (MAR) calculations to simultaneous maximum acceptable risk thresholds (SMART) for multiple treatment-related risks. We extend these methods to include the computation and display of confidence intervals and apply the approach to 3 published discrete-choice experiments to evaluate its utility to inform regulatory decisions. Methods. We generate MAR estimates and SMART curves and compare them with trial-based benefit-risk profiles of select treatments for depression, psoriasis, and thyroid cancer. Results. In the depression study, SMART curves with 70% to 95% confidence intervals portray which combinations of 2 adverse events would be considered acceptable. In the psoriasis example, the asymmetric confidence intervals for the SMART curve indicate that relying on independent MARs versus SMART curves when there are nonlinear preferences can lead to decisions that could expose patients to greater risks than they would accept. The thyroid cancer application shows an example in which the clinical incidence of each of 3 adverse events is lower than the single-event MARs for the expected treatment benefit, yet the collective risk profile surpasses acceptable levels when considered jointly. Limitations. Nonrandom sample of studies. Conclusions. When evaluating conventional MARs in which the observed incidences are near the estimated MARs or where preferences demonstrate diminishing marginal disutility of risk, conventional MAR estimates will overstate risk acceptance, which could lead to misinformed decisions, potentially placing patients at greater risk of adverse events than they would accept. Implications. The SMART method, herein extended to include confidence intervals, provides a reproducible, transparent evidence-based approach to enable decision makers to use data from discrete-choice experiments to account for multiple adverse events. HIGHLIGHTS: Estimates of maximum acceptable risk (MAR) for a defined treatment benefit can be useful to inform regulatory decisions; however, the conventional metric considers one adverse event at a time.This article applies a new approach known as SMART (simultaneous maximum acceptable risk thresholds) that accounts for multiple adverse events to 3 published discrete-choice experiments.Findings reveal that conventional MARs could lead decision makers to accept a treatment based on individual risks that would not be acceptable if multiple risks are considered simultaneously.",1
Determinants of Clinical Decision Making under Uncertainty in Dentistry: A Scoping Review.,"Clinical decision-making for diagnosing and treating oral and dental diseases consolidates multiple sources of complex information, yet individual clinical judgements are often made intuitively on limited heuristics to simplify decision making, which may lead to errors harmful to patients. This study aimed at systematically evaluating dental practitioners' clinical decision-making processes during diagnosis and treatment planning under uncertainty. A scoping review was chosen as the optimal study design due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the topic. Key terms and a search strategy were defined, and the articles published in the repository of the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE/PubMed) were searched, selected, and analysed in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Of the 478 studies returned, 64 relevant articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. Studies that were included were based in 27 countries, with the majority from the UK and USA. Articles were dated from 1991 to 2022, with all being observational studies except four, which were experimental studies. Six major recurring themes were identified: clinical factors, clinical experience, patient preferences and perceptions, heuristics and biases, artificial intelligence and informatics, and existing guidelines. These results suggest that inconsistency in treatment recommendations is a real possibility and despite great advancements in dental science, evidence-based practice is but one of a multitude of complex determinants driving clinical decision making in dentistry. In conclusion, clinical decisions, particularly those made individually by a dental practitioner, are potentially prone to sub-optimal treatment and poorer patient outcomes.",0
Toenail Onychomycosis with or without Diabetes in Canada: Patient Treatment Preferences and Health State Utilities.,"BACKGROUND: Toenail onychomycosis affects approximately 6.7% of Canadians. Symptoms include nail discolouration/disfiguration and pain; psychosocial impacts contribute to reduced health-related quality-of-life. Comorbid diabetes increases the risk of complications and exacerbates burden. Treatment may include topical therapy and/or oral agents. PURPOSE: To understand toenail onychomycosis treatment preferences, and to quantify the impact of toenail onychomycosis, with or without diabetes, on patient well-being. METHODS: Adults living in Canada with self-reported, physician-diagnosed, toenail onychomycosis were recruited online. A discrete choice experiment was used to quantify treatment preferences. Scenarios were randomized; data were analyzed using conditional logit regression. Health state utilities were estimated using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3(®). Results were stratified by diabetes status and toenail onychomycosis severity; the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to assess between-group utility differences. RESULTS: Three-hundred thirteen participants with toenail onychomycosis were included (161 had comorbid diabetes; 61.3%, severe onychomycosis). The mean age was 57.7 years; 55.9% were male. Treatment attributes with statistically significant impacts on patient preferences were efficacy (odds ratio [OR],1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.05 per 1% increased treatment success), administration method (one pill versus topical nail lacquer reference, 1.14; 1.04-1.26; topical solution applicator versus reference: 1.15; 1.03-1.29), severe adverse events (0.85; 0.80-0.90 per 1% increased risk), and risk of potential pharmacodynamic (0.80; 0.76-0.85) and alcohol (0.93; 0.88-0.98) interactions; preferences were more pronounced for efficacy and avoiding severe adverse events among toenail onychomycosis patients with comorbid diabetes. The mean (95% CI) utility value was 0.73 (0.70-0.75) overall, and statistically significantly lower (p=0.02) for toenail onychomycosis patients with diabetes (0.70; CI, 0.66-0.73) than those without (0.76; CI, 0.72-0.79). CONCLUSION: Among patients with toenail onychomycosis, the presence of diabetes was associated with differing treatment-related preferences. Utility values for patients with toenail onychomycosis represent a significant decline from full health that is exacerbated by comorbid diabetes.",1
Experiences Navigating the Pregnancy Care Continuum During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented changes in care delivery across the pregnancy care continuum. Our primary objective with this research was to characterize the range of ways that the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic affected pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care experiences. METHODS: Pregnant and recently pregnant patients (n = 20) from obstetrics and gynecology clinical sites associated with Massachusetts General Hospital were interviewed about their experiences with prenatal care, childbirth, and postpartum care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interview transcripts were analyzed for emergent themes. RESULTS: This sample included 20 pregnant and postpartum people, including 11 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy or postpartum and nine with suspected infection. The ways in which COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19 affected experiences of prenatal care, childbirth, and postpartum care were complex and varied. Three themes were identified across narratives of pregnancy, birth, and postpartum care: patient perceptions of diminished access to care, stigma due to COVID-19 infection, and limited capacity of providers to honor patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of pregnant and recently pregnant people's experiences during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic can inform infection control policies and clinical care delivery practices that are more congruent with the needs and values of pregnant, birthing, and postpartum people as institutions craft responses to future pandemics. Approaches that maximize meaningful access across the pregnancy care continuum, center patients' priorities within adapted care models, and honor patient preferences as much as possible are important aspects of an appropriate response to future waves of COVID-19 and other pandemics.",0
Patient-related outcomes of conventional impression making versus intraoral scanning for prosthetic rehabilitation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Intraoral scanning has been reported to be preferred by patients over conventional impression making. Nevertheless, information regarding patient-related outcomes for conventional impression making and digital scanning is sparse. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze patient-related outcomes of intraoral scanning and conventional impression methods. The primary outcomes evaluated were patient preference and satisfaction, and the secondary outcomes discomfort, nausea, unpleasant taste, breathing difficulty, pain, and anxiety. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual searches were performed for clinical trials that evaluated patient-related outcomes for intraoral scanning and conventional impression making for prosthetic rehabilitation. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa scale were used to assess the quality of the studies. Random-effects models using mean difference were used for meta-analyses. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q test and I(2) statistics (α=.05). RESULTS: The search strategy identified 1626 articles, and 11 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Patients preferred intraoral scanning to conventional impression making. The mean difference for patient preference was 15.02 (95% confidence interval of 8.33 - 21.73; P<.001). Discomfort, absence of nausea, absence of unpleasant taste, and absence of breathing difficulty were also significantly different (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoral scanning is a suitable alternative to conventional impression procedures, promoting less discomfort for patients sensitive to taste, nausea, and breathing difficulty than when conventional impression making techniques are used.",0
Patient preferences and experiences regarding thrombopoietin-receptor agonists for immune thrombocytopenia in The Netherlands (TRAPeze Netherlands study).,"OBJECTIVE: Identify patient experience and preference towards thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) in treatment of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in the Netherlands. METHODS: The Thrombopoietin-Receptor Agonist Patient experience (TRAPeze) survey used a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit patient preferences and a patient burden survey (PBS) to evaluate the clinical and social impact of ITP. TRAPeze collected responses from 6th October to 19th November 2021. RESULTS: Seventy-six respondents completed the DCE: treatment preference appeared to be driven by method of administration (odds ratio [OR] 4.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.88-6.52), frequency of dosing (OR 2.33; 95% CI 1.86-2.92) and drug-food interactions (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.54-2.37). Respondents preferred therapies delivered orally over subcutaneous injection (OR 4.22; 95% CI 2.76-6.46), dosed once weekly over once daily (OR 2.37; 95% CI 1.58-3.54) and without food restrictions over with restrictions (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.52-2.38). Sixty-nine respondents completed the DCE and PBS (mean [range] age 53 [19-83] years, 65% female). Seven incomplete PBS responses were excluded from analysis. Respondents were currently, or most recently, receiving eltrombopag (n = 43) or romiplostim (n = 26), of which 30% (n = 21/69) had previously received another TPO-RA. Loss (29%, n = 6/21) and lack (29%, n = 6/21) of response were the most common reasons for switching TPO-RA. Only 28% (n = 18/65) of respondents felt their TPO-RA increased energy levels. CONCLUSION: Patients preferred therapies delivered orally, dosed less frequently and without food restrictions. QoL of ITP patients on TPO-RAs can be improved; the burden analyses presented can inform future efforts towards this.",1
Comparison of direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin in chronic limb-threatening ischemia.,"OBJECTIVE: The role of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in chronic limb-threatening ischemia after revascularization is unknown. Current evidence-based guidelines do not provide clear guidance on the role of anticoagulation or the selection of anticoagulant. Current practice is highly varied and based on provider and patient preference. The purpose of this study was to measure the impact of different anticoagulants on the incidence of major adverse limb events (MALEs) after revascularization for chronic limb-threatening ischemia, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for major bleeding events. METHODS: This was a single-center, observational, retrospective cohort study. Subjects were eligible if they were 18 years or older; underwent endovascular or open revascularization for chronic limb-threatening ischemia, rest pain, or tissue loss; and were subsequently prescribed apixaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin. The primary end point was the incidence of MALEs, including above-ankle amputation or major index-limb reintervention, within 1 year of index event. Secondary end points included the rate of all-cause mortality, MACEs, and incidence of International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding. RESULTS: From January 1, 2017, to September 20, 2022, 141 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were reviewed. The median age was 67 years, with 92 patients prescribed apixaban or rivaroxaban and 49 patients prescribed warfarin. Of these, 42 patients were prescribed triple antithrombotic therapy, 88 dual antithrombotic therapy, and 13 anticoagulant monotherapy. The primary outcome of 1-year MALEs occurred in 36.7% of the warfarin group and 33.7% of the DOAC group (relative risk [RR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.53-2.25; P = .72). Secondary outcomes of 1-year MACEs (10.2% vs 4.3%; RR, 2.35; 95% CI, 0.60-9.18; P = .18) and 1-year all-cause mortality (26.5% vs 16.3%; RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.70-3.78; P = .15) did not differ between the groups. The secondary safety outcome of 1-year ISTH major bleeding occurred in 16.3% of the warfarin group and 4.3% of the DOAC group (RR, 3.76; 95% CI, 1.07-13.19; P = .015). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia who were revascularized and prescribed anticoagulation with apixaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin on discharge, no difference in MALEs, MACEs, or all-cause mortality was found. However, 1-year admissions for ISTH major bleeding were significantly higher among patients prescribed warfarin. A randomized trial may confirm these findings.",0
Research Knowledge Translation in Sensory Integration-Based Therapy: Exploring Subjectivity of Clinical Expertise.,"Background. Clinical expertise is the mechanism through which practitioners implement other components of evidence-based practice (EBP). Within occupational therapy practice, intervention approaches that are both closely and loosely aligned with Ayres' Theory of Sensory Integration are widespread, offering a unique opportunity to investigate the subjective nature of clinical expertise in EBP. Purpose. This qualitative study explored motivations to offer sensory integration-based interventions, and factors informing occupational therapists' clinical decision making in relation to an arguably contentious evidence base. Method. Six post-graduate sensory integration trained UK occupational therapists participated in individual semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed, member-checked and analyzed using thematic coding analysis. Findings. Despite sound understanding of theory and continuous efforts to develop clinical knowledge, non-traditional hierarchies of evidence notably inform clinical decisions. The clinical expertise required for integration of patient preferences, clinical state and circumstances, and research evidence is informed by pragmatic responses to facilitators and barriers across contexts, combined with unique profession-specific identity factors. Implications. While empirical healthcare research is ideally undertaken under controlled conditions, realities of clinical practice are rarely so clear cut. Study findings highlight important subjective factors that are central to real-world research knowledge translation and further understanding of the clinical expertise component of EBP.",0
Physician- and Patient-Elicited Barriers and Facilitators to Implementation of a Machine Learning-Based Screening Tool for Peripheral Arterial Disease: Preimplementation Study With Physician and Patient Stakeholders.,"BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is underdiagnosed, partially due to a high prevalence of atypical symptoms and a lack of physician and patient awareness. Implementing clinical decision support tools powered by machine learning algorithms may help physicians identify high-risk patients for diagnostic workup. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a novel machine learning-based screening tool for PAD among physician and patient stakeholders using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). METHODS: We performed semistructured interviews with physicians and patients from the Stanford University Department of Primary Care and Population Health, Division of Cardiology, and Division of Vascular Medicine. Participants answered questions regarding their perceptions toward machine learning and clinical decision support for PAD detection. Rapid thematic analysis was performed using templates incorporating codes from CFIR constructs. RESULTS: A total of 12 physicians (6 primary care physicians and 6 cardiovascular specialists) and 14 patients were interviewed. Barriers to implementation arose from 6 CFIR constructs: complexity, evidence strength and quality, relative priority, external policies and incentives, knowledge and beliefs about intervention, and individual identification with the organization. Facilitators arose from 5 CFIR constructs: intervention source, relative advantage, learning climate, patient needs and resources, and knowledge and beliefs about intervention. Physicians felt that a machine learning-powered diagnostic tool for PAD would improve patient care but cited limited time and authority in asking patients to undergo additional screening procedures. Patients were interested in having their physicians use this tool but raised concerns about such technologies replacing human decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Patient- and physician-reported barriers toward the implementation of a machine learning-powered PAD diagnostic tool followed four interdependent themes: (1) low familiarity or urgency in detecting PAD; (2) concerns regarding the reliability of machine learning; (3) differential perceptions of responsibility for PAD care among primary care versus specialty physicians; and (4) patient preference for physicians to remain primary interpreters of health care data. Facilitators followed two interdependent themes: (1) enthusiasm for clinical use of the predictive model and (2) willingness to incorporate machine learning into clinical care. Implementation of machine learning-powered diagnostic tools for PAD should leverage provider support while simultaneously educating stakeholders on the importance of early PAD diagnosis. High predictive validity is necessary for machine learning models but not sufficient for implementation.",0
What drives researcher preferences for chemical compounds? Evidence from conjoint analysis.,"We investigated the attributes and attribute levels that affect researcher preferences for chemical compounds. We conducted a conjoint analysis on survey data of Korean researchers using chemical compounds from the Korean Chemical Bank (KCB). The analysis estimated the part-worth utility for each attribute's level, calculated relative importance of attributes, and classified user segmentation with different patterns. The results show that the structure database offers the highest part-worth utility to researchers, followed by high new functionality, price, screening service, and drug action data provided only by the KCB. Notably, researchers view the offer of a structured database and high new functionality as more important than other attributes in decision-making about research and development of chemical compounds. Furthermore, the results of segmentation analysis demonstrated that researchers have distinct usage patterns of chemical compounds: researchers consider structure database and high new functionality in cluster 1; and high new functionality and price in cluster 2, to be the most appealing. We discussed some policy and strategic implications based on the findings of this study and proposed some limitations.",0
Aversion to Mesh Use in Pelvic Floor Surgery in a Latina Population at the U.S.-Mexico Border.,"IMPORTANCE: Limited studies have examined patient aversion to mesh use in pelvic surgery, especially in Latinas. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess aversion to pelvic surgery with mesh for urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse in a sample of Latinas on the U.S.-Mexico border. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of self-identified Latinas with symptoms of pelvic floor disorders, recruited at their initial consultation visit at a single, academic urogynecology clinic. Participants completed a validated survey to assess perceptions of mesh use in pelvic surgery. Participants also completed questionnaires assessing the presence and severity of pelvic floor symptoms and level of acculturation. The primary outcome was aversion to mesh surgery, as indicated by a response of ""yes"" or ""maybe"" to the question ""Based on what you already know, would you avoid surgery using mesh?"" Descriptive analysis, univariate relative risk, and linear regression analysis were completed to identify characteristics associated with mesh avoidance. Significance was assessed and considered at P values <0.05. RESULTS: Ninety-six women were included. Only 6.3% had prior pelvic floor surgery using mesh. Sixty-six percent indicated that they would be likely to avoid pelvic surgery that uses mesh. Only 9.4% indicated that they obtained information regarding mesh directly from medical professionals. Levels of concern regarding the use of mesh varied widely (29.2% not worried, 19.1% somewhat worried, 16.9% very worried). Higher percentages of ""more acculturated"" participants indicated a desire to avoid mesh surgery (58.7% vs 27.3%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this Latina population, a majority of patients indicated an aversion to using mesh in pelvic surgery. Few patients obtained information regarding mesh directly from medical professionals, relying instead on nonmedical sources.",0
"""But I Have a Pacer…There Is No Point in Engaging in Hypothetical Scenarios"": A Non-Imminently Dying Patient's Request for Pacemaker Deactivation.","In this case report, we describe a woman with advancing dementia who still retained decisional capacity and was able to clearly articulate her request for deactivation of her implanted cardiac pacemaker-a scenario that would result in her death. In this case, the patient had the autonomy to make her decision, but clinicians at an outside hospital refused to deactivate her pacemaker even though they were in unanimous agreement that the patient had capacity to make this decision, citing personal discomfort and a belief that her decision seemed out of proportion to her suffering. We evaluated her at our hospital, found her to have decision-making capacity, and deactivated her pacer resulting in her death about 9 days later. While some clinicians may be comfortable discussing patient preferences for device deactivation in patients who are imminently dying, we can find no reports in the literature of requests for device deactivation from patients with terminal diagnoses who are not imminently dying.",0
"Preferences for preventive treatments for rheumatoid arthritis: discrete choice survey in the UK, Germany and Romania.","OBJECTIVE: To quantify preferences for preventive therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) across three countries. METHODS: A web-based survey including a discrete choice experiment was administered to adults recruited via survey panels in the UK, Germany and Romania. Participants were asked to assume they were experiencing arthralgia and had a 60% chance of developing RA in the next 2 years and completed 15 choices between no treatment and two hypothetical preventive treatments. Treatments were defined by six attributes (effectiveness, risks and frequency/route of administration) with varying levels. Participants also completed a choice task with fixed profiles reflecting subjective estimates of candidate preventive treatments. Latent class models (LCMs) were conducted and the relative importance of attributes, benefit-risk trade-offs and predicted treatment uptake was subsequently calculated. RESULTS: Completed surveys from 2959 participants were included in the analysis. Most participants preferred treatment over no treatment and valued treatment effectiveness to reduce risk more than other attributes. A five-class LCM best fitted the data. Country, perceived risk of RA, health literacy and numeracy predicted class membership probability. Overall, the maximum acceptable risk for a 40% reduction in the chance of getting RA (60% to 20%) was 21.7%, 19.1% and 2.2% for mild side effects, serious infection and serious side effects, respectively. Predicted uptake of profiles reflecting candidate prevention therapies differed across classes. CONCLUSION: Effective preventive pharmacological treatments for RA were acceptable to most participants. The relative importance of treatment attributes and likely uptake of fixed treatment profiles were predicted by participant characteristics.",1
Patient Preferences and Their Effects on Rehabilitation Outcomes: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of aligning patients' preferences with specific rehabilitation delivery modes on rehabilitation outcomes. DESIGN: A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: The study cohort comprised 208 patients referred for physiotherapy rehabilitation after non-surgical or surgical interventions for rotator cuff injury, shoulder impingement, or acromioclavicular osteoarthritis. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three rehabilitation modalities: 1) group-based exercise, 2) individual exercise, or 3) home exercise. In this study, participants were categorized into two groups: ""matched preference"" (MP) and ""unmatched preference"" (UP). The primary outcome measure was change in function, measured with the shortened Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH). Secondary outcome measures were change in pain, assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), mental well-being measured with the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), health-related quality of life assessed using the EuroQol-5Domain questionnaire (EQ-5D), fear avoidance assessed using the Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire (ÖMPQ), and overall treatment satisfaction. Outcomes were assessed at 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: The primary outcome measure, QuickDASH, showed no significant differences between groups at either 3 months (-3.0 [-8.2 to 2.3]) or 6 months (0.5 [-5.7 to 6.7]). Additionally, no significant differences were observed in the secondary outcome measures. CONCLUSION: Matching patients' preferences for specific rehabilitation delivery modes did not seem to effect rehabilitation outcomes.",0
Older adult preferences regarding benefits and harms of statin and aspirin therapy for cardiovascular primary prevention.,"OBJECTIVE: Personalizing preventive therapies for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is particularly important for older adults, as they tend to have multiple chronic conditions, increased risk for medication adverse effects, and may have heterogenous preferences when weighing health outcomes. However, little is known about outcome preferences related to ASCVD preventive therapies in older adults. METHODS: In May 2021, using an established online panel, KnowledgePanel, we surveyed older US adults aged 65-84 years without history of ASCVD on outcome preferences related to statin therapy (benefit outcomes to be reduced by the therapy: heart attack, stroke; adverse effects: diabetes, abnormal liver test, muscle pain) or aspirin therapy (benefit outcomes: heart attack, stroke; adverse effects: brain bleed, bowel bleed, stomach ulcer). We used standardized best-worst scores (range of -1 for ""least worrisome"" to +1 for ""most worrisome"") and conditional logistic regression to examine the relative importance of the outcomes. RESULTS: In this study, 607 ASCVD-free participants (median age 74, 46% male, 81% White) were included; 304 and 303 completed the statin and aspirin versions of the survey, respectively. For statin-related outcomes, stroke and heart attack were most worrisome (score 0.55; 95% CI 0.51, 0.60) and (0.53; 0.48, 0.58), followed by potential harms of diabetes (-0.07; -0.10, -0.03), abnormal liver test (-0.25; -0.29, -0.20), and muscle pain (-0.77; -0.82, -0.73). For aspirin-related outcomes, stroke and heart attack were similarly most worrisome (0.48; 0.43, 0.52) and (0.43; 0.38, 0.48), followed by brain bleed (0.30; 0.25, 0.34), bowel bleed (-0.31; -0.33, -0.28), and stomach ulcer (-0.90; -0.92, -0.87). Conditional logistic regression and subgroup analyses by age, sex, and race yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults generally consider outcomes related to benefits of ASCVD primary preventive therapies-stroke and heart attack-more important than their adverse effects. Integrating patient preferences with risk assessment is an important next step for personalizing ASCVD preventive therapies for older adults.",1
Development of a discrete choice experiment questionnaire to elicit preferences by pregnant women and policymakers for the expansion of non-invasive prenatal screening.,"OBJECTIVE: An instrument for measuring intervention preferences applicable to both patients and policymakers would make it possible to better confront the needs of the supply and demand sides of the health care system. This study aimed to develop a discrete choice experiments (DCE) questionnaire to elicit the preferences of patients and policymakers. The instrument was specifically developed to estimate preferences for new conditions to be added to a screening program for fetal chromosomal anomalies. METHODS: A DCE development study was conducted. The methods employed included a literature review, a qualitative study (based on individual semi-structured interviews, consultations, and a focus group discussion) with pregnant women and policymakers, and a pilot project with 33 pregnant women to validate the first version of the instrument and test the feasibility of its administration. RESULTS: An initial list of 10 attributes was built based on a literature review and the qualitative research components of the study. Five attributes were built based on the responses provided by the participants from both groups. Eight attributes were consensually retained. A pilot project performed on 33 pregnant women led to a final instrument containing seven attributes: 'conditions to be screened', 'test performance', 'moment at gestational age to obtain the test result', 'degree of test result certainty to the severity of the disability', 'test sufficiency', 'information provided from test result', and 'cost related to the test'. CONCLUSION: It is possible to reach a consensus on the construction of a DCE instrument intended to be administered to pregnant women and policymakers. However, complete validation of the consensual instrument is limited because there are too few voting members of health technology assessment agencies committees to statistically ascertain the relevance of the attributes and their levels.",1
Primary Whole-gland Ablation for the Treatment of Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: A Focal Therapy Society Best Practice Statement.,"CONTEXT: Whole-gland ablation is a feasible and effective minimally invasive treatment for localized prostate cancer (PCa). Previous systematic reviews supported evidence for favorable functional outcomes, but oncological outcomes were inconclusive owing to limited follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the real-world data on the mid- to long-term oncological and functional outcomes of whole-gland cryoablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in patients with clinically localized PCa, and to provide expert recommendations and commentary on these findings. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library publications through February 2022 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. As endpoints, baseline clinical characteristics, and oncological and functional outcomes were assessed. To estimate the pooled prevalence of oncological, functional, and toxicity outcomes, and to quantify and explain the heterogeneity, random-effect meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Twenty-nine studies were identified, including 14 on cryoablation and 15 on HIFU with a median follow-up of 72 mo. Most of the studies were retrospective (n = 23), with IDEAL (idea, development, exploration, assessment, and long-term study) stage 2b (n = 20) being most common. Biochemical recurrence-free survival, cancer-specific survival, overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and metastasis-free survival rates at 10 yr were 58%, 96%, 63%, 71-79%, and 84%, respectively. Erectile function was preserved in 37% of cases, and overall pad-free continence was achieved in 96% of cases, with a 1-yr rate of 97.4-98.8%. The rates of stricture, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, rectourethral fistula, and sepsis were observed to be 11%, 9.5%, 8%, 0.7%, and 0.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The mid- to long-term real-world data, and the safety profiles of cryoablation and HIFU are sound to support and be offered as primary treatment for appropriate patients with localized PCa. When compared with other existing treatment modalities for PCa, these ablative therapies provide nearly equivalent intermediate- to long-term oncological and toxicity outcomes, as well as excellent pad-free continence rates in the primary setting. This real-world clinical evidence provides long-term oncological and functional outcomes that enhance shared decision-making when balancing risks and expected outcomes that reflect patient preferences and values. PATIENT SUMMARY: Cryoablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound are minimally invasive treatments available to selectively treat localized prostate cancer, considering their nearly comparable intermediate- to long term cancer control and preservation of urinary continence to other radical treatments in the primary setting. However, a well-informed decision should be made based on one's values and preferences.",0
Eliciting Depression Patients' Preferences for Medication Management: A Protocol for Discrete Choice Experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Depression threatens people's lives and imposes huge economic burden. Antidepressant therapy is the first-line treatment for depression, and patient adherence to medication is the key to successful treatment. Depression patients have poor medication adherence, which leads to failure of depression management and significantly poorer clinical outcomes. Incorporating patient preferences into clinical decisions can improve uptake rates, optimize treatment adherence. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) can elicit and quantify individual preferences. Previous DCE studies were conducted in developed countries and ignored the influences of factors other than the medication. This paper outlines an ongoing DCE that aims to (1) explore medication-management-related characteristics that may affect depression patients' adherence to antidepressant, (2) elicit how depression patients consider the trade-offs among different medication managements. METHODS: The six attributes and their levels were developed through a literature review, semi-structured interviews and experts and focus group discussions. A fractional factorial design in the software Ngene 1.2 version was used to generate 36 choice sets, and they were divided into 3 blocks. A mixed logit model will be used to explore the patients' preferences, willingness to pay and uptake rate of depression patients for medication management attributes. RESULTS: The final questionnaire consists of three parts. The first is the introduction, which introduces the purpose of the study and the requirements of completing the questionnaire. This was followed by a general information questionnaire, which included sociodemographic characteristics. The last part is DCE tasks, which include 13 DCE choice sets, and each choice set include two alternative and one ""opt-out"" option. The pilot-test results showed the questionnaire was easy to understand and could be used in formal surveys. CONCLUSION: Our study shows how the development process of the study can be conducted and reported systematically and rigorously according to the theoretical foundation and design principles in DCE.",1
Aortic Stenosis Phenotypes and Precision Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"Patients with a clinical indication for aortic valve replacement can either undergo surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). There are many different factors that go into determining which type of replacement to undergo, including age, life expectancy, comorbidities, frailty, and patient preference. While both options offer significant benefits to patients in terms of clinical outcomes and quality of life, there is growing interest in expanding the indications for TAVI due to its minimally invasive approach. However, it is worth noting that there are several discrepancies in TAVI outcomes in regards to various endpoints, including death, stroke, and major cardiovascular events. It is unclear why these discrepancies exist, but potential explanations include the diversity of etiologies for aortic stenosis, complex patient comorbidities, and ongoing advancements in both medical therapies and devices. Of these possibilities, we propose that phenotypic variation of aortic stenosis has the most significant impact on post-TAVI clinical outcomes. Such variability in phenotypes is often due to a complex interplay between underlying comorbidities and environmental and inherent patient risk factors. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that patient genetics may also play a role in aortic stenosis pathology. As such, we propose that the selection and management of TAVI patients should emphasize a precision medicine approach.",0
[Patient Preferences for Exercise Therapy in People with Severe Mental Illness in Germany].,"PURPOSE: Assessing the experience with and the attitudes towards exercise therapy in persons with severe mental illness (SMI). Furthermore, potential variables of high preference towards exercise therapy are investigated. METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study of SMI patients aged between 18 and 65 years (n=385). Patients were interviewed by trained staff using standardised instruments. Potential variables were analysed using a hierarchic binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: 84,4% of SMI patients had a high preference for exercise therapy; of these, 44,1% exercised regularly. Among patients with severe mental illness especially a higher value in the GAF-assessment (p=0,041) and living in a metropolitan area (p=0,011) predict a high preference for exercise therapy. CONCLUSION: Most of the patients with severe mental illness interviewed in this study place a surprisingly high value on sports and exercise therapy. Due to the increasing evidence with regard to positive effects of these therapies, it may be an excellent starting point to expand sports and exercise therapy as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. At the same time, strategies for everyday transfer need to be implemented more rigorously.",0
"Protocol of the Comparison of Intravesical Therapy and Surgery as Treatment Options (CISTO) study: a pragmatic, prospective multicenter observational cohort study of recurrent high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.","BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer poses a significant public health burden, with high recurrence and progression rates in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Current treatment options include bladder-sparing therapies (BST) and radical cystectomy, both with associated risks and benefits. However, evidence supporting optimal management decisions for patients with recurrent high-grade NMIBC remains limited, leading to uncertainty for patients and clinicians. The CISTO (Comparison of Intravesical Therapy and Surgery as Treatment Options) Study aims to address this critical knowledge gap by comparing outcomes between patients undergoing BST and radical cystectomy. METHODS: The CISTO Study is a pragmatic, prospective observational cohort trial across 36 academic and community urology practices in the US. The study will enroll 572 patients with a diagnosis of recurrent high-grade NMIBC who select management with either BST or radical cystectomy. The primary outcome is health-related quality of life (QOL) at 12 months as measured with the EORTC-QLQ-C30. Secondary outcomes include bladder cancer-specific QOL, progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and financial toxicity. The study will also assess patient preferences for treatment outcomes. Statistical analyses will employ targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) to address treatment selection bias and confounding by indication. DISCUSSION: The CISTO Study is powered to detect clinically important differences in QOL and cancer-specific survival between the two treatment approaches. By including a diverse patient population, the study also aims to assess outcomes across the following patient characteristics: age, gender, race, burden of comorbid health conditions, cancer severity, caregiver status, social determinants of health, and rurality. Treatment outcomes may also vary by patient preferences, health literacy, and baseline QOL. The CISTO Study will fill a crucial evidence gap in the management of recurrent high-grade NMIBC, providing evidence-based guidance for patients and clinicians in choosing between BST and radical cystectomy. The CISTO study will provide an evidence-based approach to identifying the right treatment for the right patient at the right time in the challenging clinical setting of recurrent high-grade NMIBC.

Values Assessment Tools in Advanced Cancer: A Clinical Literature Review.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced cancer may receive cancer treatment that does not reflect their values because they may not be completely aware of what is important to them regarding treatment-related decisions when they are diagnosed. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review was to determine whether existing values assessment tools can improve awareness of treatment-related decisional values in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: PubMed®, CINAHL®, and PsycINFO® databases were searched for original English-language articles evaluating values assessment tools that could be used to assess patients with advanced cancer. The quality of the identified tools was evaluated using selected International Patient Decision Aid Standards instrument, version 3.0, criteria. FINDINGS: All tools identified are appropriate for use in patients with advanced cancer. Two scored at least 80% on the selected International Patient Decision Aid Standards criteria. The Short Graphic Values History Tool was developed with patient and clinician input and may be particularly useful for low-literacy patient populations with advanced cancer. No values assessment tools have been identified specifically for use in patients with advanced cancer.",0
Understanding patient preferences for student clinician attire: a cross-sectional study of a student chiropractic clinic in Australia.,"OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have investigated the role of clinical attire in establishing patient-held perceptions of professionalism and knowledgeability across various healthcare settings. This study aimed to understand patients' preferences for chiropractic student attire. METHODS: Three hundred and twenty patients were recruited from a university chiropractic clinic and asked to complete an online questionnaire. The patients' preferences for five different attires were rated and calculated as the composite score of five domains (knowledgeable, trustworthy, caring, professional, and comfortable). RESULTS: While 71.9% of participants indicated that how students dress was important to them, most (63.4%) disagreed that wearing a white coat was essential for chiropractic student clinicians. The most preferred form of attire was the current clinic shirt. CONCLUSION: The attire worn by chiropractic student clinicians at a single institution was found to be an influential attribute. Student chiropractic clinicians should dress professionally to make a good first impression. This study provided some guidance with the ongoing debate around students' dress code.",0
"Feasibility, Effectiveness and Safety of Elastomeric Pumps for Delivery of Antibiotics to Adult Hospital Inpatients-A Systematic Review.","Elastomeric infusion pumps (EMPs) have been implemented in many fields, including analgesia, chemotherapy and cardiology. Their application in antimicrobials is mainly limited to the outpatient setting, but with a need to optimise inpatient antimicrobial treatment, the use of EMPs presents a potential option. This review aimed to identify if the use of EMPs within an inpatient setting is feasible, effective and safe for antimicrobial use. Criteria for inclusion were human studies that involved the treatment of an infection with intravenous antimicrobial agents via an EMP. A search strategy was developed covering both the indexed and grey literature, with all study designs included. The review found 1 eligible study enrolling 6 patients. There was strong patient preference for EMPs (6/6), and daily tasks were easily completed whilst attached to the EMP. Nurses (5/5) also preffered the pumps, and the majority reported them as easy to use. The review has identified the need for further research in the area. Evidence for the use of EMPs to administer antibiotics in the inpatient setting is scarce, and more work is needed to understand the advantages to patients, to healthcare workers and from an antimicrobial stewardship perspective. Potential disadvantages that may put patients at risk also need investigating.",0

Non-insulin Medications for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is predicted to affect 366 million people over the age of 65 years by the year 2030. As the understanding of the core defects associated with T2D advanced, researchers recognized management should target multiple defects in glucose metabolism. As a result, efforts to manage T2D focus on developing new drug therapies aimed at addressing each of the identified metabolic defects. Optimal treatment of T2D is necessary to decrease the risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, and vascular diseases. This article discusses non-insulin pharmacologic treatments for T2D that are guided by glycemic efficacy, safety profiles, effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk, tolerability, patient comorbidities, route of administration, patient preference, and cost.",0
Ethical Aspects of Prodromal Synucleinopathy Prognostic Counseling.,"Alpha-synucleinopathies can be identified in their prodromal phase, raising several ethical issues. In this review, we first provide definitions of prodromal α-synucleinopathies and discuss the importance of distinguishing between prodromes and risk factors. Next, we discuss the implications of a diagnosis of prodromal α-synucleinopathy and considerations regarding prognostic counseling in both clinical and research settings. We review available data on patient preferences regarding disclosure as well as providers' perspectives. We examine the pros and cons of disclosing a diagnosis of prodromal α-synucleinopathy, taking into consideration the differences between clinical and research settings. Asking about willingness to know in clinical and research settings and the shared decision-making process applied to prognostic counseling is discussed. Concerning research settings, ethical aspects regarding clinical trials are addressed. Availability of direct-to-consumer technologies will likely lead to novel contexts requiring prognostic counseling, and future neuroprotective or neuromodulating treatments may require further considerations on the timing, role, and importance of prognostic counseling. Recommendations on how to address ethical gaps should be a priority for patients, medical professional societies, and research workgroups. Ethical issues must be considered as an integral part of the overall clinical and research approach to prodromal synucleinopathies.",0
Attitudes towards disposition of cryopreserved sperm in the event of death.,"INTRODUCTION: To evaluate patient preference for sperm disposition in case of death based on demographic factors and infertility etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed at a university hospital-affiliated fertility center. Charts of 550 men undergoing cryopreservation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) between 2016-2019 were reviewed to create a descriptive dataset. Patients previously signed consent forms stating their preference for sperm transfer to their partner or disposal in the event of their subsequent death. Patients undergoing sperm cryopreservation for the purpose of ART were analyzed to assess associations between demographic characteristics and etiology of infertility and their choice to either transfer sperm to their partner or discard. RESULTS: A total of 84.9% (342/403) of patients included in final analyses elected to transfer their sperm to their partner in the event of their death. Factors associated with a significantly increased likelihood to transfer versus discard included a male-factor infertility diagnosis compared to female-factor infertility diagnosis (transfer rate 89.3% vs. 79.9%; p = .022) and commercial insurance coverage versus non-commercial/no insurance coverage (transfer rate 86.3% vs. 75.0%, p = .029). No significant differences relating to age, race/ethnicity, occupation classification, marital status or duration of marriage, or prior paternity were found. CONCLUSION: A majority of male patients seeking sperm cryopreservation for ART elected to transfer their sperm to their partner if future death should occur. There does not appear to be a clear factor that would impact this decision based on demographic characteristics.",0
Patient Preferences for Lung Cancer Interception Therapy.,"IMPORTANCE: Interception therapy requires individuals to undergo treatment to prevent a future medical event, but little is known about preferences of individuals at high risk for lung cancer and whether they would be interested in this type of treatment. OBJECTIVE: To explore preferences of individuals at high risk for lung cancer for potential interception therapies to reduce this risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study used a discrete-choice experiment and included hypothetical lung cancer interception treatments with 4 attributes: reduction in lung cancer risk over 3 years, injection site reaction severity, nonfatal serious infection, and death from serious infection. Respondents were assigned to a baseline lung cancer risk of 6%, 10%, or 16% over 3 years. The discrete-choice experiment was administered online (July 13 to September 6, 2022) to US respondents eligible for lung cancer screening according to US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines. Participants included adults aged 50 to 80 years with at least a 20 pack-year smoking history. Statistical analysis was performed from September to December 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Attribute-level preference weights were estimated, and conditional relative attribute importance, maximum acceptable risks, and minimum acceptable benefits were calculated. Characteristics of respondents who always selected no treatment were also explored. RESULTS: Of the 803 survey respondents, 495 (61.6%) were female, 138 (17.2%) were African American or Black, 55 (6.8%) were Alaska Native, American Indian, or Native American, 44 (5.5%) were Asian or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 104 (13.0%) were Hispanic, Latin American, or Latinx, and 462 (57.5%) were White, Middle Eastern or North African, or a race or ethnicity not listed; and mean (SD) age was 63.0 (7.5) years. Most respondents were willing to accept interception therapy and viewed reduction in lung cancer risk as the most important attribute. Respondents would accept a greater than or equal to a 12.0 percentage point increase in risk of nonfatal serious infection if lung cancer risk was reduced by at least 20.0 percentage points; and a greater than or equal to 1.2 percentage point increase in risk of fatal serious infection if lung cancer risk was reduced by at least 30.0 percentage points. Respondents would require at least a 15.4 (95% CI, 10.6-20.2) percentage point decrease in lung cancer risk to accept a 12.0 percentage point increase in risk of nonfatal serious infection; and at least a 23.1 (95% CI, 16.4-29.8) percentage point decrease in lung cancer risk to accept a 1.2 percentage point increase in risk of death from serious infection. Respondents who were unwilling to accept interception therapy in any question (129 [16.1%]) were more likely to be older and to currently smoke with no prior cessation attempt, and less likely to have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or examined for skin cancer. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of individuals at high risk of lung cancer, most respondents were willing to consider interception therapy. These results suggest the importance of benefit-risk assessments for future lung cancer interception treatments.",1
Preferences for Adjuvant Immunotherapy in Adults with Resected Stage III Melanoma-A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to quantify adult preferences for adjuvant immunotherapy for resected melanoma and the influence of varying levels of key attributes and baseline characteristics. METHODS: A D-efficient design generated 12 choice tasks for two alternative treatments, adjuvant immunotherapy or no adjuvant immunotherapy. Recruitment to the online discrete choice experiment (DCE) occurred via survey dissemination by eight Australian melanoma consumer and professional groups, targeting adults with resected stage III melanoma, considering or having received adjuvant immunotherapy. The DCE included six attributes with two to three levels each, including 3-year risk of recurrence, mild, permanent and fatal adverse events (AEs), drug regimen and annual out-of-pocket costs. A mixed multinomial logit model was used to estimate preferences and calculate marginal rates of substitution and marginal willingness to pay (mWTP). RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 116 respondents, who chose adjuvant immunotherapy over no adjuvant immunotherapy in 70% of choice tasks. Respondents preferred adjuvant immunotherapy when associated with reduced: probabilities of recurrence, permanent and fatal AEs, and out-of-pocket costs. mWTP for an absolute reduction of 1% in 3-year risk of recurrence was less for respondents with lower rather than higher incomes, AU$794 (US$527) and AU$2190 (US$1454) per year. Respondents accepted an additional 4% chance of a permanent AE to reduce their absolute risk of 3-year recurrence by 1%. Respondents were willing to accept an extra 2% chance of 3-year recurrence to lower their chance of a fatal AE by 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Almost three-quarters of respondents chose adjuvant immunotherapy over no adjuvant immunotherapy, preferring treatment that improved efficacy and safety. Findings may inform decisions about access to adjuvant immunotherapy following surgery for melanoma.",1
Giant condyloma acuminatum surgical management: a case report and literature review.,"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Condyloma acuminatum (CA) or genital warts, represents a rare sexually transmitted disease caused by the human papillomavirus. Infection occurs when host basal cells are exposed to viral infection through a damaged epithelial barrier, during sexual intercourse, or due to other minor skin abrasions. Giant condyloma acuminatum (GCA) has a higher rate of malignant transformation than CA. CASE PRESENTATION: We are presenting a 44-year-old single gentleman known as a smoker, hepatitis B positive, vitiligo, and hypercholesteromia. He was an alcoholic and had multiple heterosexual relationships abroad. Referred from the dermatology clinic, complaining of genital warts that had increased in size for 10 years. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: CA management includes local applications like imiquimod and podophyllotoxin and clinician-administered treatments such as cryotherapy, surgical excision, electrosurgery, and CO(2) laser therapy. Other options, such as interferon, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy, are available. The selection of therapy should be individualized and based upon consideration of the extent of the disease, patient preference, cost, adverse effects, treatment availability, and the response to previous treatments. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice for GCA. CONCLUSION: We present a patient with GCA in the perianal area that was surgically treated with an excellent outcome.",0
"Management of Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer. Part I: Intermediate-/High-risk and Locally Advanced Disease, Biochemical Relapse, and Side Effects of Hormonal Treatment: Report of the Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference 2022.","BACKGROUND: Innovations in imaging and molecular characterisation and the evolution of new therapies have improved outcomes in advanced prostate cancer. Nonetheless, we continue to lack high-level evidence on a variety of clinical topics that greatly impact daily practice. To supplement evidence-based guidelines, the 2022 Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC 2022) surveyed experts about key dilemmas in clinical management. OBJECTIVE: To present consensus voting results for select questions from APCCC 2022. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Before the conference, a panel of 117 international prostate cancer experts used a modified Delphi process to develop 198 multiple-choice consensus questions on (1) intermediate- and high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer, (2) biochemical recurrence after local treatment, (3) side effects from hormonal therapies, (4) metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, (5) nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, (6) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and (7) oligometastatic and oligoprogressive prostate cancer. Before the conference, these questions were administered via a web-based survey to the 105 physician panel members (""panellists"") who directly engage in prostate cancer treatment decision-making. Herein, we present results for the 82 questions on topics 1-3. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Consensus was defined as ≥75% agreement, with strong consensus defined as ≥90% agreement. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The voting results reveal varying degrees of consensus, as is discussed in this article and shown in the detailed results in the Supplementary material. The findings reflect the opinions of an international panel of experts and did not incorporate a formal literature review and meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These voting results by a panel of international experts in advanced prostate cancer can help physicians and patients navigate controversial areas of clinical management for which high-level evidence is scant or conflicting. The findings can also help funders and policymakers prioritise areas for future research. Diagnostic and treatment decisions should always be individualised based on patient and cancer characteristics (disease extent and location, treatment history, comorbidities, and patient preferences) and should incorporate current and emerging clinical evidence, therapeutic guidelines, and logistic and economic factors. Enrolment in clinical trials is always strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2022 once again identified important gaps (areas of nonconsensus) that merit evaluation in specifically designed trials. PATIENT SUMMARY: The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) provides a forum to discuss and debate current diagnostic and treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The conference aims to share the knowledge of international experts in prostate cancer with health care providers and patients worldwide. At each APCCC, a panel of physician experts vote in response to multiple-choice questions about their clinical opinions and approaches to managing advanced prostate cancer. This report presents voting results for the subset of questions pertaining to intermediate- and high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer, biochemical relapse after definitive treatment, advanced (next-generation) imaging, and management of side effects caused by hormonal therapies. The results provide a practical guide to help clinicians and patients discuss treatment options as part of shared multidisciplinary decision-making. The findings may be especially useful when there is little or no high-level evidence to guide treatment decisions.",0
Indiana Pouch Continent Cutaneous Urinary Diversion After Robotic-assisted Radical Cystectomy: A 16-Year Experience.,"BACKGROUND: Population-based practice patterns in the United States reveal continent diversions are only performed in 8%-10.4% of patients.(1-4) Ideally, for patients undergoing radical cystectomy the choice of urinary diversion should be influenced by clinical factors and patient preference, with discussions surrounding quality of life. Unfortunately, receipt of continent diversion has been shown to be influenced by a plethora of other factors such as surgeon preference/training, geography, socioeconomic status, gender, and hospital volume.(1-3) Thus, by providing detailed instruction and long-term follow-up, we hope to mitigate some of these disparities by changing the perceptions regarding feasibility and complications of continent diversions. OBJECTIVE: To provide step-by-step instruction and to report long-term clinical outcomes in bladder cancer patients receiving an Indiana pouch continent cutaneous urinary diversion (CCUD) after robot-assisted radical cystectomy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: After Institutional Review Board approval, a prospectively maintained bladder cancer database was queried for patients with T1-T4, N0-N1, M0 bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy with CCUD at a tertiary referral center from 2004 to 2020. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Complications at 30- and 90-day were recorded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Continence rates were recorded by chart review. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 97 patients were included with a median follow-up of 93months. Clinically, 91.8% had ≤T2 disease and 29.9% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The median length of surgery was 8.0 hours, length of hospital stay was 8.3days, and urinary continence rate was 99.0%. The overall complication rate was 73.2% and 76.5% at 30- and 90-day, respectively. The major complication rate (Clavien III-V) was 17.5% at 30-day and 22.7% at 90-day. The most common major complications were abdominal infection and uretero-colonic stricture. The readmission rate was 21.4% and median overall survival was 108months. CONCLUSION: CCUD provides exceptional functional outcomes with acceptable complication rates compared to other diversion types. CCUD is a reliable reconstructive option and with this step-by-step video as a reference, we hope it will be offered to more patients.",0
"Provider perspectives on patient-centered contraceptive counseling for Latinas in Baltimore, MD.","OBJECTIVES: To explore: 1) provider narratives of their contraceptive counseling practices with Latina patients within the context of patient-centered care (PCC); and 2) provider perceptions about the barriers to the provision of patient-centered contraceptive counseling in general and more specifically, with Latina patients in Baltimore, MD. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted 25 semistructured qualitative interviews with physicians  and nurse practitioners from four specialties who provide contraceptive care to Latinas in Baltimore, MD. We analyzed data using directed content analysis. We discuss findings with attention to major constructs of PCC, applying a reproductive justice framework. RESULTS: Providers described a contraceptive counseling approach focused on pregnancy prevention as the primary goal. Most respondents used a tiered-effectiveness approach, even while noting the importance of PCC. Providers noted health system barriers to PCC, including time constraints and insurance status. Provider-reported patient-attributed barriers included low patient education/health literacy, culturally-attributed misconceptions about contraception, and language discordance. CONCLUSION: Providers described knowledge of and intention to practice PCC but had limited integration of it in their own counseling with Latinas. Responses suggest tension between an expressed desire to provide PCC and paternalistic counseling paradigms that prioritize pregnancy prevention over patient preferences. Inequitable health system barriers also interfere with true implementation of contraceptive PCC. IMPLICATIONS: Translating contraceptive PCC into practice, especially for marginalized communities, is paramount. Training should teach clinicians to recognize systems of structural inequity and discrimination that have informed approaches to counseling but are not reflective of PCC. Institutional policies must address health system barriers that also hamper PCC.",0
Internet search analytics for shoulder arthroplasty: what questions are patients asking?,"BACKGROUND: Common questions about shoulder arthroplasty (SA) searched online by patients and the quality of this content are unknown. The purpose of this study is to uncover questions SA patients search online and determine types and quality of webpages encountered. METHODS: The ""People also ask"" section of Google Search was queried to return 900 questions and associated webpages for general, anatomic, and reverse SA. Questions and webpages were categorized using the Rothwell classification of questions and assessed for quality using the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria. RESULTS: According to Rothwell classification, the composition of questions was fact (54.0%), value (24.7%), and policy (21.3%). The most common webpage categories were medical practice (24.6%), academic (23.2%), and medical information sites (14.4%). Journal articles represented 8.9% of results. The average JAMA score for all webpages was 1.69. Journals had the highest average JAMA score (3.91), while medical practice sites had the lowest (0.89). The most common question was, ""How long does it take to recover from shoulder replacement?"" CONCLUSIONS: The most common questions SA patients ask online involve specific postoperative activities and the timeline of recovery. Most information is from low-quality, non-peer-reviewed websites, highlighting the need for improvement in online resources. By understanding the questions patients are asking online, surgeons can tailor preoperative education to common patient concerns and improve postoperative outcomes.",0
Patient Perspectives on Outpatient versus Inpatient Cervical Ripening for Induction of Labor.,"Objectives Our objectives were to compare patient perceived control and experience with outpatient versus inpatient cervical ripening. Study Design This is a retrospective mixed-methods analysis of a quality improvement initiative focused on the impact to patients of incorporating outpatient cervical ripening into routine practice. Postpartum inpatients who had elected for outpatient cervical ripening (outpatients) and those who met criteria for outpatient cervical ripening but opted for an inpatient setting (inpatients) were invited to participate in the study. Patients completed the Perceived Control in Childbirth Scale, and scores were compared between outpatient and inpatient groups using Mann-Whitney U test. In addition, semi-structured questions elicited feedback prior to hospital discharge, and this qualitative data was analyzed using iterative thematic analysis. Results The study population consisted of 36 outpatients and 38 inpatients. The median score on the Perceived Control in Childbirth Scale was 69 for outpatients and 67 for inpatients (p-value = 0.49), out of a maximum score of 72 (representing the highest level of perceived control). Both groups reported similarly high levels of perceived control, regardless of cervical ripening setting. In the qualitative analysis, pain was the most common theme in both groups. Inpatients reported more distress despite access to stronger pain medications. Outpatients utilized a variety of distraction techniques and expressed gratitude for their setting more than inpatients. Conclusions Outpatient cervical ripening can be a patient-centered solution to obstetric throughput challenges arising from increased numbers of inductions. Those who underwent outpatient cervical ripening had similar perceived control to those who underwent inpatient cervical ripening, suggesting that individual patient preferences are most important in determining the optimal setting for care. The patients' reported experiences identified focus areas for process improvement efforts and future research, including improving patient education regarding expectations and innovating new pain management strategies for cervical ripening.",0
Solid-state analysis for pharmaceuticals: Pathways to feasible and meaningful analysis.,"The solid state of matter is the preferred starting point for designing a pharmaceutical product. This is driven by both patient preferences and the relative ease of supplying a solid pharmaceutical product with desired quality and performance. Solid form diversity is increasingly prevalent as a crucial element in designing these products, which underpins the importance of solid-state analytical methods. This paper provides a critical analysis of challenges related to solid-state analytics, as well as considerations and suggestions for feasible and meaningful pharmaceutical analysis.",0
Racial and ethnic disparities in end-of-life care for patients with oesophageal cancer: death trends over time.,"BACKGROUND: Given significant morbidity and mortality associated with oesophageal cancer, supportive, high-quality end-of-life care is critical. Most patients with advanced cancer prefer to die at home, but incongruence between preferred and actual place of death is common. Here, we examined trends and disparities in location of death among patients with oesophageal cancer. METHODS: Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Range Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database, we utilized multinomial logistic regression to assess associations between sociodemographic characteristics and location of death for patients with oesophageal cancer (n = 237,063). Additionally, we utilized linear regression models to evaluate the significance of changes in location of death trends over time and disparities in the relative change in location of death trends across sociodemographic groups. FINDINGS: From 2003 to 2019, there was a decrease of deaths in hospitals, nursing homes, and outpatient medical facilities/emergency departments and an increase of deaths at home and in hospice. Relative to White decedents, Black and Asian decedents were less likely to die at home (relative risk ratio (RRR): 0.58 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-0.60], RRR: 0.57 [95% CI: 0.53-0.61]) and in hospice (RRR: 0.67 [95% CI: 0.64-0.71], RRR: 0.49 [95% CI: 0.43-0.55]) when compared to the hospital. Similar disparities were noted for American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) decedents. These disparities persisted even upon stratifying by the number of listed causes of death, a proxy for severity of illness. Time trend analysis indicated that increases in deaths in hospice over time occurred at a slower rate for AIAN and Asian decedents relative to White decedents. INTERPRETATION: 2 in 5 patients with oesophageal cancer die at home, with an increasing proportion dying at home and in hospice-in line with general patient preferences. However, location of death disparities have largely persisted over time among racial and ethnic minority groups. Our findings suggest the importance of improving access to advance care planning and delivering tailored, person-centred interventions. FUNDING: None.",0
Mapping European Association of Urology Guideline Practice Across Europe: An Audit of Androgen Deprivation Therapy Use Before Prostate Cancer Surgery in 6598 Cases in 187 Hospitals Across 31 European Countries.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-practice gaps exist in urology. We previously surveyed European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for strong recommendations underpinned by high-certainty evidence that impact patient experience for which practice variations were suspected. The recommendation ""Do not offer neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) before surgery for patients with prostate cancer"" was prioritised for further investigation. ADT before surgery is neither clinically effective nor cost effective and has serious side effects. The first step in improving implementation problems is to understand their extent. A clear picture of practice regarding ADT before surgery across Europe is not available. OBJECTIVE: To assess current ADT use before prostate cancer surgery in Europe. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an observational cross-sectional study. We retrospectively audited recent ADT practices in a multicentre international setting. We used nonprobability purposive sampling, aiming for breadth in terms of low- versus high-volume, academic, versus community and public versus private centres. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Our primary outcome was adherence to the ADT recommendation. Descriptive statistics and a multilevel model were used to investigate differences between countries across different factors (volume, centre type, and funding type). Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with low, intermediate, and high risk, and for those with locally advanced prostate cancer. We also collected reasons for nonadherence. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We included 6598 patients with prostate cancer from 187 hospitals in 31 countries from January 1, 2017 to May 1, 2020. Overall, nonadherence was 2%, (range 0-32%). Most of the variability was found in the high-risk subgroup, for which nonadherence was 4% (range 0-43%). Reasons for nonadherence included attempts to improve oncological outcomes or preoperative tumour parameters; attempts to control the cancer because of long waiting lists; and patient preference (changing one's mind from radiotherapy to surgery after neoadjuvant ADT had commenced or feeling that the side effects were intolerable). Although we purposively sampled for variety within countries (public/private, academic/community, high/low-volume), a selection bias toward centres with awareness of guidelines is possible, so adherence rates may be overestimated. CONCLUSIONS: EAU guidelines recommend against ADT use before prostate cancer surgery, yet some guideline-discordant ADT use remains at the cost of patient experience and an additional payer and provider burden. Strategies towards discontinuation of inappropriate preoperative ADT use should be pursued. PATIENT SUMMARY: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is sometimes used in men with prostate cancer who will not benefit from it. ADT causes side effects such as weight gain and emotional changes and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Guidelines strongly recommend that men opting for surgery should not receive ADT, but it is unclear how well the guidance is followed. We asked urologists across Europe how patients in their institutions were treated over the past few years. Most do not use ADT before surgery, but this still happens in some places. More research is needed to help doctors to stop using ADT in patients who will not benefit from it.",0
Respiratory Management of Patients With Neuromuscular Weakness: An American College of Chest Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline and Expert Panel Report.,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory failure is a significant concern in neuromuscular diseases (NMDs). This CHEST guideline examines the literature on the respiratory management of patients with NMD to provide evidence-based recommendations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An expert panel conducted a systematic review addressing the respiratory management of NMD and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence and formulating and grading recommendations. A modified Delphi technique was used to reach a consensus on the recommendations. RESULTS: Based on 128 studies, the panel generated 15 graded recommendations, one good practice statement, and one consensus-based statement. INTERPRETATION: Evidence of best practices for respiratory management in NMD is limited and is based primarily on observational data in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The panel found that pulmonary function testing every 6 months may be beneficial and may be used to initiate noninvasive ventilation (NIV) when clinically indicated. An individualized approach to NIV settings may benefit patients with chronic respiratory failure and sleep-disordered breathing related to NMD. When resources allow, polysomnography or overnight oximetry can help to guide the initiation of NIV. The panel provided guidelines for mouthpiece ventilation, transition to home mechanical ventilation, salivary secretion management, and airway clearance therapies. The guideline panel emphasizes that NMD pathologic characteristics represent a diverse group of disorders with differing rates of decline in lung function. The clinician's role is to add evaluation at the bedside to shared decision-making with patients and families, including respect for patient preferences and treatment goals, considerations of quality of life, and appropriate use of available resources in decision-making.",0
"Dissemination and implementation of clinical practice guidelines: a longitudinal, mixed-methods evaluation of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care's knowledge translation efforts.","BACKGROUND: The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (task force) develops evidence-based preventive health care guidelines and knowledge translation (KT) tools to facilitate guideline dissemination and implementation. We aimed to determine practitioners' awareness of task force guidelines and KT tools and explore barriers and facilitators to their use. METHODS: The task force's KT team completed annual evaluations using surveys and interviews with primary care providers in Canada from 2014 to 2020, to assess practitioners' awareness and determinants of use of task force guidelines and tools. We transcribed interviews verbatim and double-coded them using a framework analysis approach. RESULTS: A total of 1284 primary care practitioners completed surveys and 183 participated in interviews. On average, 79.9% of participants were aware of the task force's 7 cancer screening guidelines, 36.2% were aware of the other 6 screening guidelines and 18.6% were aware of the 3 lifestyle or prevention guidelines. Participants identified 13 barriers and 7 facilitators to guideline and KT tool implementation; these were consistent over time. Participants identified strategies at the public and patient, provider and health systems levels to improve uptake of guidelines. INTERPRETATION: Canadian primary care practitioners were more aware of task force cancer screening guidelines than its other preventive health guidelines. Over the 6-year period, participants consistently reported barriers to guideline uptake, including misalignment with patient preferences and other provincial or specialty guideline organizations. Further evaluations will assess tailored strategies to address the barriers identified.",0
"Patterns in the provision of government-subsidised hormonal postpartum contraception in Queensland, Australia between 2012 and 2018: a population-based cohort study.","BACKGROUND: Short birth intervals and unintended pregnancy are associated with poorer maternal and infant outcomes. There is a risk of pregnancy during the immediate postpartum period unless contraception is initiated. This retrospective cohort study aimed to capture the current patterns of hormonal contraceptive provision within 12 months postpartum in a high-income country. METHODS: We used a linked administrative dataset comprising all women who gave birth in Queensland, Australia between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2018 (n=339 265 pregnancies). We described our cohort by whether they were provided with government-subsidised hormonal contraception within 12 months postpartum. The associations between hormonal postpartum contraceptive provision and demographic and clinical characteristics were examined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression and presented in terms of crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: A majority of women (60.2%) were not provided with government-subsidised hormonal postpartum contraception within 12 months postpartum. Women who were younger (<25 years), were overweight or obese, smoked, were born in Australia, were non-Indigenous, gave birth in a public hospital, or were in the lowest socioeconomic status group were more likely to be provided with postpartum contraception after adjusting for other covariates, compared with their counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to increase the provision and uptake of contraception in the immediate postpartum period are needed to prevent short birth intervals and unintended pregnancy and ensure women's fertility intentions are enacted. Ongoing research is needed to examine the factors influencing women's access to contraceptive services and, further, the types of contraception provided.",0
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), one of the most common causes of liver disease, is an increasingly common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several demographic, clinical, and genetic factors contribute to HCC risk in NAFLD patients, which may inform risk stratification scores. Proven efficacious approaches to primary prevention approach in patients with non-viral liver disease remain an area of need. Semi-annual surveillance is associated with improved early tumor detection and reduced HCC-related mortality; however, patients with NAFLD have several challenges to effective surveillance, including under-recognition of at-risk patients, low surveillance utilization in clinical practice, and lower sensitivity of current tools for early-stage HCC detection. Treatment decisions are best made in a multidisciplinary fashion and are informed by several factors including tumor burden, liver dysfunction, performance status, and patient preferences. Although patients with NAFLD often have larger tumor burden and increased comorbidities compared to counterparts, they can achieve similar post-treatment survival with careful patient selection. Therefore, surgical therapies continue to provide a curative treatment option for patients diagnosed at an early stage. Although there has been debate about the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with NAFLD, current data are insufficient to change treatment selection based on liver disease etiology.",0
Prioritizing Treatment Goals of People Diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder in the US: Best-Worst Scaling Results.,"PURPOSE: Bipolar I disorder (BP-I) is associated with significant disease burden, but evidence on treatment goals in people diagnosed with BP-I is scarce. This study sought to quantify treatment goals related to the pharmacological management of BP-I in adults in the US and to identify if subgroups of people with similar treatment goals exist. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A best-worst scaling (BWS) of treatment goals was developed based on available literature and input from experts and patients and was distributed as part of a survey between August and September 2021. Survey participants were adults with a self-reported diagnosis of BP-I who were recruited via an online panel in the US. Participants were asked to prioritize the importance of 16 treatment goals using BWS. BWS scores were computed using multinomial logistic regression, with the scores across all goals summing to 100 for each participant. Subgroups of people with similar preferences were identified using latent class analysis. RESULTS: The most important treatment goals for people diagnosed with BP-I (N=255) were ""being less impulsive, angry, or irritable"" (score: 9.73), or being ""able to feel pleasure or happiness"" (score: 9.54). Goals related to reducing the incidence of various potential adverse events of medication (scores: ≤4.51) or ""reducing dependence on others"" (score: 3.04) were less important. Two subgroups were identified. One subgroup (n=111) prioritized symptom-focused goals, considering ""reducing frequency of mania, depression, and mixed episodes"" and ""being less impulsive, angry or irritable"" the most important (scores: 12.46 and 11.85, respectively). The other subgroup (n=144) placed significantly more importance on social functioning-focused goals, including beginning or maintaining a relationship with a partner/significant other, and with family and/or friends (scores: 8.45 and 7.70, respectively). CONCLUSION: People diagnosed with BP-I prioritized emotional improvements. Subgroups of people with BP-I prioritized either symptom-focused or social functioning-focused treatment goals.",1
Infliximab vs adalimumab: Points to consider when selecting anti-tumor necrosis factor agents in pediatric patients with Crohn's disease.,"Biologic agents with various mechanisms against Crohn's disease (CD) have been released and are widely used in clinical practice. However, two anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents, infliximab (IFX) and adalimumab (ADL), are the only biologic agents approved by the Food and Drug Administration for pediatric CD currently. Therefore, in pediatric CD, the choice of biologic agents should be made more carefully to achieve the therapeutic goal. There are currently no head-to-head trials of biologic agents in pediatric or adult CD. There is a lack of accumulated data for pediatric CD, which requires the extrapolation of adult data for the positioning of biologics in pediatric CD. From a pharmacokinetic point of view, IFX is more advantageous than ADL when the inflammatory burden is high, and ADL is expected to be advantageous over IFX in sustaining remission in the maintenance phase. Additionally, we reviewed the safety profile, immunogenicity, preference, and compliance between IFX and ADL and provide practical insights into the choice of anti-TNF therapy in pediatric CD. Careful evaluation of clinical indications and disease behavior is essential when prescribing anti-TNF agents. In addition, factors such as the efficacy of induction and maintenance of remission, safety profile, immunogenicity, patient preference, and compliance play an important role in evaluating and selecting treatment options.",0
"Comprehensive, Evidence-Based, Consensus Guidelines for Prescription of Opioids for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP).","BACKGROUND: Opioid prescribing in the United States is decreasing, however, the opioid epidemic is continuing at an uncontrollable rate. Available data show a significant number of opioid deaths, primarily associated with illicit fentanyl use. It is interesting to also note that the data show no clear correlation between opioid prescribing (either number of prescriptions or morphine milligram equivalent [MME] per capita), opioid hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, the data suggest that the 2016 guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have resulted in notable problems including increased hospitalizations and mental health disorders due to the lack of appropriate opioid prescribing as well as inaptly rapid tapering or weaning processes. Consequently, when examined in light of other policies and complications caused by COVID-19, a fourth wave of the opioid epidemic has been emerging. OBJECTIVES: In light of this, we herein seek to provide guidance for the prescription of opioids for the management of chronic non-cancer pain. These clinical practice guidelines are based upon a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological evidence and have been developed by a panel of multidisciplinary experts assessing the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations and offer a clear explanation of logical relationships between various care options and health outcomes. METHODS: The methods utilized included the development of objectives and key questions for the various facets of opioid prescribing practice. Also utilized were employment of trustworthy standards, and appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest(s). The literature pertaining to opioid use, abuse, effectiveness, and adverse consequences was reviewed. The recommendations were developed after the appropriate review of text and questions by a panel of multidisciplinary subject matter experts, who tabulated comments, incorporated changes, and developed focal responses to questions posed. The multidisciplinary panel finalized 20 guideline recommendations for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Summary of the results showed over 90% agreement for the final 20 recommendations with strong consensus. The consensus guidelines included 4 sections specific to opioid therapy with 1) ten recommendations particular to initial steps of opioid therapy; 2) five recommendations for assessment of effectiveness of opioid therapy; 3) three recommendations regarding monitoring adherence and side effects; and 4) two general, final phase recommendations. LIMITATIONS: There is a continued paucity of literature of long-term opioid therapy addressing chronic non-cancer pain. Further, significant biases exist in the preparation of guidelines, which has led to highly variable rules and regulations across various states. CONCLUSION: These guidelines were developed based upon a comprehensive review of the literature, consensus among expert panelists, and in alignment with patient preferences, and shared decision-making so as to improve the long-term pain relief and function in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. Consequently, it was concluded - and herein recommended - that chronic opioid therapy should be provided in low doses with appropriate adherence monitoring and understanding of adverse events only to those patients with a proven medical necessity, and who exhibit stable improvement in both pain relief and activities of daily function, either independently or in conjunction with other modalities of treatments.",0
Patients' and informal caregivers' perspectives on self-management interventions for type 2 diabetes mellitus outcomes: a mixed-methods overview of 14 years of reviews.,"BACKGROUND: Self-management interventions (SMIs) are core components of high-quality care in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to identify and summarise the scientific evidence exploring the perspectives of patients with T2DM and their informal caregivers on outcomes of SMIs, and the key themes to enhance T2DM patient-centred care. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods overview of reviews. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, up to June 2021 for systematic reviews (SRs) exploring the perspectives of adults with T2DM and their informal caregivers, regarding self-management. Two reviewers conducted independently study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. We estimated the degree of overlap across SRs. We performed a qualitative analysis using a thematic synthesis approach. RESULTS: We identified 54 SRs, corresponding to 939 studies, with a slight overlap. Most SRs (47/54, 87%) were considered high quality. We developed summaries for 22 outcomes and identified six overarching themes: (1) diabetic identity; (2) accessing healthcare; (3) experience of care; (4) engagement with self-management; (5) outcomes awareness; and (6) challenges adhering to self-management. We found important variability in how patients with T2DM and their informal caregivers value critical outcomes influenced by the disease progression and several contextual factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings represent what matters most to patients with T2DM and their informal caregivers regarding outcomes of SMIs. Our results can facilitate the development and evaluation of SMIs, and guide decision-making in diabetes care, including the formulation of decisions and recommendations.",0
Phase III Randomized Non-Inferiority Study of OSS Versus PEG + Electrolyte Colonoscopy Preparation in Adolescents.,"OBJECTIVES: Many protocols and preparations are used for bowel cleansing before pediatric colonoscopy but few are based on scientific evidence. We evaluated efficacy, safety, tolerability, and patient preference of oral sulfate solution (OSS) at 75% of the adult dose versus polyethylene glycol (PEG)-electrolyte solution in adolescents presenting for diagnostic colonoscopy. METHODS: Phase III, randomized, evaluator-blinded, non-inferiority study of OSS and PEG in adolescents aged 12-17 years. OSS and PEG were administered in 2 doses on the day before colonoscopy. Primary endpoint included proportion of patients with successful overall preparation (4-point scale). Secondary endpoints included overall and segmental bowel cleansing (Boston Bowel Preparation Scale; BBPS), completed colonoscopies, duration of examination, time to cecal intubation, proportion of nasogastric tubes (NGTs), adverse events (AEs) and acceptability. RESULTS: Successful cleansing was achieved in 71.4% and 79.0% of patients receiving OSS and PEG, respectively [adjusted difference -7.61 (95% confidence interval, CI, -18.45 to 3.24); P = 0.0907]. Segmental BBPS score for the left and transverse colon were similar between treatment groups, but better for the right colon with PEG than OSS [2.2 (95% CI, 2.0-2.4) and 1.9 (95% CI, 1.7-2.1), respectively; P = 0.0015]. Significantly fewer OSS patients needed NGT placement to ingest the whole solution [9/125 (7.2%)] than PEG patients [36/116 (31.0%); P < 0.0001]. Treatment acceptability was significantly higher with OSS than PEG ( P < 0.0001). Duration of examination, completed colonoscopies, and time to cecal intubation were similar between preparations. Gastrointestinal AEs including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and distension were similar in both groups but more patients receiving PEG had AEs assessed as incapacitating. CONCLUSIONS: Non-inferiority of OSS to PEG was not demonstrated, but OSS was associated with a lower requirement for NGT, better acceptability, and less frequent severe AEs than with PEG.",0
Patient preferences for pilonidal sinus treatments: a discrete choice experiment survey.,"BACKGROUND: A range of treatments are available for pilonidal sinus disease (PSD), each of which has a different risk/benefit profile. The aim of this study was to collect patient views on which interventions they would rather avoid and which outcomes they most value for PSD. METHOD: We conducted an online survey using the discrete choice experiment (DCE) method. DCE task involved participants choosing the best treatment option when presented with a set of competing hypothetical treatment profiles. Participants with symptomatic PSD, referred for elective surgery were recruited from 33 NHS trusts between 2020 and 2022. Collected DCE data were analysed using regression analyses. RESULTS: One hundred and eleven participants completed the survey. In the overall group, low risk of infection/persistence was the most important characteristic when making a treatment decision (attribute importance score of 70%), followed by treatments with shorter recovery time with an attribute importance score of 30%. The results demonstrated that patients are willing to accept trade-offs between treatment recovery time and risk of infection/persistence. Patients above 30 years old are willing to accept a higher chance of treatment failure in exchange for rapid treatment recovery (risk tolerance between 22.35 - 34.67 percentage points). Conversely, patients in the younger age groups, were risk averse, and were only willing to accept a small risk 1.51-2.15 in exchange for a treatment with faster recovery time. All patient groups appear to the reject the excision and leave open technique due to the need for protracted nursing care. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the need for shared decision making when it comes to surgery for PSD.",1
Research recruitment and consent methods in a pandemic: a qualitative study of COVID-19 patients' perspectives.,"BACKGROUND: Virtual data collection methods and consent procedures adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic enabled continued research activities, but also introduced concerns about equity, inclusivity, representation, and privacy. Recent studies have explored these issues from institutional and researcher perspectives, but there is a need to explore patient perspectives and preferences. This study aims to explore COVID-19 patients' perspectives about research recruitment and consent for research studies about COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory qualitative focus group and interview study among British Columbian adults who self-identified as having had COVID-19. We recruited participants through personal contacts, social media, and REACH BC, an online platform that connects researchers and patients in British Columbia. We analyzed transcripts inductively and developed thematic summaries of each coding element. RESULTS: Of the 22 individuals recruited, 16 attended a focus group or interview. We found that autonomy and the feasibility of participation, attitudes toward research about COVID-19, and privacy concerns are key factors that influence participants' willingness to participate in research. We also found that participants preferred remote and virtual approaches for contact, consent, and delivery of research on COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who had COVID-19 are motivated to participate in research studies and value autonomy in their decision to participate, but researchers must be sensitive and considerate toward patient preferences and concerns, particularly as researchers adopt virtual recruitment and data collection methods. Such awareness may increase research participation and engagement.",0
Pretrichial Brow Lift.,"Patients commonly present with chief complaints of ""droopy eyes"" or similar phrases, but ""droopy eyes"" often mean different things. In many cases, the anatomical issue in question is upper eyelid dermatochalasis. Sometimes, there may also be pseudoherniated fat in the upper eyelid or even lacrimal gland ptosis. Blepharoptosis commonly occurs with age as well, but what patients frequently overlook is the contribution of brow ptosis to the appearance of aging in the periorbital area and to upper visual field deficits. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the surgeon to evaluate the periorbital area thoroughly and to identify which patients are candidates for brow lifting, which may or may not be performed in conjunction with upper eyelid surgery, and then further to determine the optimal approach for brow lifting in the individual patient. In this article, we discuss the pretrichial brow lift approach, its benefits, and its limitations. Since the first description of surgical brow lifting by Passot in 1919, myriad techniques have evolved to improve results. The traditional coronal approach was the first of the modern approaches developed in 1926 and was followed shortly thereafter by trichophytic and pretrichial variants. Direct, midforehead, temporal, endoscopic, and transblepharoplasty approaches followed over the ensuing 70 years. As technology in facial plastic surgery has advanced and the focus has shifted towards minimally invasive procedures, endoscopic and transblepharoplasty techniques have gained popularity over open approaches. However, the coronal incision and its variants are still commonly employed in the following situations: Revision brow lifting after minimally invasive surgery that did not produce the desired result. Advancing the frontal hairline while simultaneously performing a brow lift for aging face indications. Advancing the frontal hairline while providing access for frontal cranioplasty in gender affirmation surgery for transgender females. Accessing the frontal sinus, naso-orbito-ethmoid (NOE) region, brain, or anterior skull base for post-traumatic reconstruction or oncologic resection. Accessing the frontal pericranium for the development of an osteoplastic flap. The choice of approach between coronal and pretrichial/trichophytic depends on whether any adjustment to the frontal hairline is necessary. A traditional coronal approach across the vertex of the scalp will elevate the hairline commensurately with the width of the scalp strip excised. Pretrichial/trichophytic approaches tend not to elevate the hairline and may even be used to lower it, if necessary. The choice between pretrichial and trichophytic approaches is generally based on surgeon and patient preference. The pretrichial approach places the incision directly anterior to the hairline, whereas the trichophytic approach runs a few millimeters posterior to the hairline in order to hide the scar. In some cases, such as for hairline adjustment, the incision may run partially anterior to the hairline and partially within it.",0
Patient Preferences for Investigating Cancer-Related Symptoms in Australian General Practice: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Striking the right balance between early cancer diagnosis and the risk of excessive testing for low-risk symptoms is of paramount importance. Patient-centred care must also consider patient preferences for testing. AIM: To investigate diagnostic testing preferences of the Australian public for symptoms associated with oesophagogastric (OG), bowel, or lung cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: One of three discrete choice experiments (DCEs) related to either OG, bowel, or lung cancer were administered to a nationally representative sample of Australians aged 40 and above. METHODS: Each DCE comprised three scenarios with symptom positive predictive values (PPVs) for undiagnosed cancer ranging from 1% to 3%. The numerical risk was concealed from participants. DCE attributes encompassed the testing strategy, GP familiarity, test and result waiting times, travel duration, and test cost. Preferences were estimated using conditional and mixed logit models. RESULTS: A total of 3013 individuals participated in one of three DCEs: OG (n=1004), Bowel (n=1006), and Lung (n=1003). Preferences were chiefly driven by waiting time, test cost followed by the test type. There was preference for more invasive tests. When confronted with symptoms carrying an extremely low risk (symptom PPV of 1% or less), participants were more inclined to abstain from testing. CONCLUSIONS: Access-related factors, particularly waiting times and testing costs, emerged as the most pivotal elements influencing preferences, underscoring the substantial impact of these systemic factors on patient choices regarding investigations.",1
Preference for primary care in Chinese homebound patients.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the preference for primary healthcare (PHC) and investigate associated factors among homebound residents in both rural and urban areas of China. It provides valuable insights to facilitate the rational allocation of healthcare resources and promote the utilization of PHC. METHODS: In this nationally representative cross-sectional study, we utilized the most recent data (2020) from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). Participants were recruited from 25 provincial-level administrative regions in both rural and urban areas of China. Homebound patients were asked to provide details about their individual characteristics, variables related to family caregiving, and preferences for PHC. Multivariable logistic models were used to analyze potential factors associated with preference for PHC. Estimates of association were reported as odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The study found that 58.43% of rural patients reported a preference for PHC, while 42.78% of urban patients favored PHC. Compared to rural participants who did not received inpatient care in the past year, those who received inpatient care in the past year had 67% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR:0.33, 95% CI:0.19-0.59); Compared to rural participants who did not received family caregiving when ill, those who received family caregiving when ill had 59% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.41, 95% CI:0.21-0.77). Correspondingly, Compared to urban participants who did not received inpatient care in the past year, those who had received inpatient care in the past year had 75% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.10-0.56); Compared to urban participants who did not received family caregiving when ill, those who received family caregiving when ill had 73% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.11-0.63); Compared to urban participants who with agricultural Hukou, those with Non-agricultural Hukou had 61% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.39, 95% CI:0.18-0.83); Compared to urban participants living in the eastern part of mainland China, those living in the central part of China had 188% higher odds of choosing PHC (OR: 2.88, 95% CI: 1.14-7.29). CONCLUSION: Policymakers should focus on tailoring PHC to vulnerable populations and prioritizing family-based public health strategies for enhancing homebound patients' perceptions of PHC. Furthermore, further study is needed on whether the Hukou registration system affects the barriers that homebound patients experience in choosing healthcare providers.",0

Pharmacists' perspectives on recommending herbal medicines for acute infections: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Community pharmacists have an essential role in antimicrobial stewardship by providing self-care advice for self-limiting infections. AIM: To explore community pharmacists' perceptions and experiences of advising patients on management of acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and urinary tract infections (UTIs), and to explore issues regarding use of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, including herbal medicines. DESIGN & SETTING: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with community pharmacists in England. METHOD: Qualitative interviews with community pharmacists were carried out face to face and by telephone between November 2019 and March 2020. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews, recorded and transcribed. A reflexive thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: In total, 18 community pharmacists were interviewed. Three main themes were identified. Theme 1 was self-management recommendations. Community pharmacists considered patients' preferences when recommending self-management strategies. Some believed that conventional OTC medications had quicker and stronger effects, while others preferred herbal OTCs as a more natural approach, particularly for less severe symptoms. Theme 2 was factors influencing pharmacists' recommendations for acute infections. This included pharmacists' perceptions of patient preferences, nature or severity of illness, research evidence, training, commercial pressures, and patient concerns about medication cost. Theme 3 was pharmacist-patient communication. Pharmacists sometimes experienced challenges with language barriers and patients' expectations of receiving antibiotics. Pharmacists emphasised the importance of being trusted by their patients. There was widespread acceptance of their role in self-management advice for acute illness and interest in the role of herbal medicines, but pharmacists did not feel confident in recommending these. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists are central to the management of self-limiting infections. There is a need to educate the public about appropriate use of antibiotics and provide training and support for pharmacists on self-management strategies including herbal medicine.",0
Exercise Therapy for Knee and Hip Osteoarthritis: Is There An Ideal Prescription?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Exercise therapy is the first line treatment for patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) but is consistently underutilized. In this review, we aim to provide health care professionals with an overview of the latest evidence in the areas of exercise therapy for OA, which can serve as a guide for incorporating the ideal exercise therapy prescription in the overall management plan for their patients with OA. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence continues to be produced supporting the use of exercise therapy for all patients with knee or hip OA. Ample evidence exists suggesting exercise therapy is a safe form of treatment, for both joint structures and the patient overall. Several systematic reviews show that exercise therapy is likely to improve patient outcomes, regardless of disease severity or comorbidities. However, no single type of exercise therapy is superior to others. SUMMARY: Health care practitioners and patients should be encouraged to incorporate exercise therapy into treatment plans and can be assured of the safety profile and likelihood of improvement in important patient outcomes. Since no single exercise therapy program shows vastly superior benefit, patient preference and contextual factors should be central to the shared decision-making process when selecting and individualising appropriate exercise therapy prescriptions.",0
Elevated end-of-life spending: A new measure of potentially wasteful health care spending at the end of life.,"OBJECTIVE: To construct a new measure of end-of-life (EoL) spending-the elevated EoL spending-and examine its associations with measures of quality of care and patient and physician preferences in comparison with the commonly used total Medicare EoL spending measures. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING: Medicare claims data for a 20% random sample of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients, from the health care quality data for 2015-2016, from the Hospital Compare and the Medicare Geographic Variation public use file, and survey data about patient and physician preferences. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed the elevated EoL spending measure as the differential monthly spending between decedents and survivors with the same one-year mortality risk, where the risk was predicted using machine learning models. We then examined the associations of the hospital referral region (HRR)-level elevated EoL spending with various health care quality measures and with the survey-elicited patient and provider preferences. We also examined analogous associations for monthly total EoL spending on decedents. DATA EXTRACTION METHODS: Medicare FFS patients who were continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A & B in 2015 and were alive as of January 1, 2016. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found a large variation in the elevated EoL spending across HRRs in the United States. There was no evidence of an association between HRR-level elevated EoL spending and established health care quality measures, including those specific to EoL care, whereas total EoL spending was positively associated with certain quality of care measures. We also found no evidence that elevated EoL spending was associated with patient preferences for EoL care. However, elevated EoL spending was positively and significantly associated with physician preferences for treatment intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that elevated EoL spending captures different resource use from conventional measures of EoL spending and may be more valuable in identifying potentially wasteful spending.",0
Using a discrete choice experiment to elicit patients' preferences and willingness-to-pay for knee osteoarthritis treatments in Thailand.,"Osteoarthritis is the most common type of joint disease among elderly patients around the world. In response to the need for patient-centered care, patients' and physicians' preferences for knee osteoarthritis treatments have been studied in multiple countries, but not in Thailand. The objective of this study was to investigate Thai patients' preferences and their willingness to pay (WTP) for knee osteoarthritis treatments by using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Six knee osteoarthritis treatment attributes, including pain relief, delayed disease progression, gastrointestinal side effects, kidney side effects, cardiovascular side effects, and cost, were used to develop a paper-based, DCE questionnaire survey. Patients with knee osteoarthritis, who were at least 18 years old and who provided written informed consent, were recruited from the orthopedic department in a tertiary care hospital in Thailand via convenience sampling. The conditional logit model was used to determine patients' preferences and WTP. The Institutional Review Board at Chulalongkorn University approved this study before it started. A total of 232 patients were collected and analyzed in this study. Patients preferred treatments with a higher efficacy (pain relief and delayed disease progression), a lower probability of side effects (gastrointestinal, kidney, and cardiovascular side effects), and a lower cost. Regarding efficacy and side effects, the patients weighted the importance of a 1% change in cardiovascular side effects (- 0.08) more heavily than 1% changes in kidney (- 0.07) and gastrointestinal (- 0.02) side effects, delayed disease progression (0.02), and pain relief (0.01). Patients were willing to pay 29.56 Thai Baht (THB) and 41.84 THB per month for every 1% increase in pain relief and delayed disease progression, respectively. Conversely, patients were willing to pay 52.04 THB, 145.18 THB and 164.23 THB per month for every 1% decrease in gastrointestinal, kidney, and cardiovascular side effects, respectively. In conclusion, pain relief, delayed disease progression, gastrointestinal side effects, kidney side effects, cardiovascular side effects, and the cost of treatment were significant factors among patients undergoing knee osteoarthritis treatment. Additionally, patients had a higher WTP for delayed disease progression than pain relief and a higher WTP for a reduced probability of cardiovascular side effects than gastrointestinal and kidney side effects. These findings could be used to support treatment decisions for knee osteoarthritis patients in Thailand.",1
"Association of Race, Ethnicity, Insurance, and Language and Rate of Breast-Conserving Therapy Among Women With Nonmetastatic Breast Cancer at an Urban, Safety-Net Hospital.","INTRODUCTION: Breast-conserving therapy (BCT), specifically breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and adjuvant radiation, provides an equivalent alternative to mastectomy for eligible patients. However, previous studies have shown that BCT is underused in the United States, particularly among marginalized demographic groups. In this study, we examine the association between race, ethnicity, insurance, and language and rate of BCS among patients treated at an academic, safety-net hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 520 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer diagnosed and treated at an academic, safety-net hospital (2009-2014). We assessed eligibility for BCT and then differences in the rate of BCT among eligible patients by race, ethnicity, insurance, and language. Reasons for not undergoing BCT were documented. RESULTS: Median age was 60 y; 55.9% were non-White, 31.9% were non-English-speaking, 15.6% were Hispanic, and 47.4% were Medicaid/uninsured. Three hundred seventy one (86.3%) underwent BCS; within this group, 324 (87.3%) completed adjuvant radiation. Among patients undergoing mastectomy, 30 patients (36.7%) were eligible for BCT; within this group, reasons for mastectomy included patient preference (n = 28) and to avoid possible re-excision or adjuvant radiation in patients with significant comorbidities (n = 2). Eligibility for BCT varied by ethnicity (Hispanic [100%], Non-Hispanic [92%], P = 0.02), but not race, language, or insurance. Among eligible patients, rate of BCS varied by age (<50 y [84.9%], ≥50 y [92.9%], P = 0.01) and ethnicity (Hispanic [98.5%], Non-Hispanic [91.3%], P = 0.04), but not race, language, or insurance. CONCLUSIONS: At our safety-net hospital, the rate of BCS among eligible patients did not vary by race, language, or insurance. Excluding two highly comorbid patients, all patients who underwent mastectomy despite being eligible for BCT were counseled regarding BCS and expressed a preference for mastectomy. Further research is needed to understand the value of BCT in the treatment of breast cancer, to ensure informed decision-making, address potential misconceptions regarding BCT, and advance equitable care for all patients.",0
American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Practice Guideline: Pharmacological Management of Chronic Idiopathic Constipation.,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is a common disorder associated with significant impairment in quality of life. This clinical practice guideline, jointly developed by the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology, aims to inform clinicians and patients by providing evidence-based practice recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of CIC in adults. METHODS: The American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that conducted systematic reviews of the following agents: fiber, osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol, magnesium oxide, lactulose), stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, senna), secretagogues (lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide), and serotonin type 4 agonist (prucalopride). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to assess the certainty of evidence for each intervention. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop clinical recommendations based on the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 10 recommendations for the pharmacological management of CIC in adults. Based on available evidence, the panel made strong recommendations for the use of polyethylene glycol, sodium picosulfate, linaclotide, plecanatide, and prucalopride for CIC in adults. Conditional recommendations were made for the use of fiber, lactulose, senna, magnesium oxide, and lubiprostone. DISCUSSION: This document provides a comprehensive outline of the various over-the-counter and prescription pharmacological agents available for the treatment of CIC. The guidelines are meant to provide a framework for approaching the management of CIC; clinical providers should engage in shared decision making based on patient preferences as well as medication cost and availability. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted to help guide future research opportunities and enhance the care of patients with chronic constipation.",0
Patient Perspectives on the Burden and Prevention of Diabetes-Related Foot Disease.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to understand patient perspectives about the impact and prevention of diabetes-related foot disease (DFD). METHODS: An online survey was distributed to patients with a history of DFD during 2020. The survey was designed alongside clinical specialists and DFD patients and utilized the health belief model. It asked about the impact of DFD on health, perceptions on preventive strategies, perceived need for additional support, and patient preferences for telehealth in DFD management. Quantitative data were summarized descriptively and compared between groups. Open-text responses were analyzed using conceptual content analysis. RESULTS: Of 80 participants with a history of DFD, foot ulcers were the complication most often experienced, with over two-thirds having been admitted to hospital for a DFD-related issue and over one-third having a DFD-related amputation. Participants had ranging perceptions on the effect of DFD on health, from minimal to crippling. Those with previous severe DFD complications leading to hospital admission found a lack of mobility and independence the consequences of most concern. Using offloading footwear was perceived as very important for preventing DFD complications, although the use of offloading footwear was low, with participants citing issues relating to cost, comfort, appearance, and access to footwear as barriers to better adherence. Perceptions on telehealth were mixed, with many participants not having access to or being comfortable with the use of digital technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DFD require additional supports for effective prevention, including offloading footwear.",0
"Who Gets to Determine Whether Home Is ""Unsafe"" at the End of Life?","BACKGROUND: At the end of life, some patients wish to be discharged directly home from the hospital, but health care teams may consider this unsafe, raising concerns for capacity and risk. However, defining risk is subjective and impacted by values, preferences, and clinical status. Accommodating patient preferences in discharge destinations can promote autonomy, dignity, and quality of life at the end of life. OBSERVATIONS: We developed a risk assessment framework to help clinicians objectively identify risk factors and protective factors and develop a comprehensive discharge plan. We applied this framework to a veteran nearing the end of life and he was able to successfully return home from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Approaching end-of-life discharges with a framework can inform discharge planning and lessen the risk of adverse events. Importantly, this framework can help clinicians communicate better and partner with patients and their loved ones in prioritizing patient values and preferences.",0
"Keeping It ""Current"": A Review of Treatment Options for the Management of Supraventricular Tachycardia.","OBJECTIVE: To review treatment options and updates that exist for the management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). DATA SOURCES: A literature search of PubMed was performed including articles from 1974 to June 2023 using the terms: arrhythmias, adenosine, verapamil, diltiazem, esmolol, propranolol, metoprolol, beta-blockers, amiodarone, PSVT, synchronized cardioversion, methylxanthines, dipyridamole, pediatrics, heart transplant, and pregnancy. Primary literature and guidelines were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were considered if they were available in English and conducted in humans. DATA SYNTHESIS: PSVT is a subset of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that presents as a rapid, regular tachycardia with an abrupt onset and termination. Due to frequent emergency department (ED) visits annually with symptoms of PSVT, appropriate and efficient management of these patients is vital. This review provides an overview of the pathophysiology of PSVT, while also describing the literature behind nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of PSVT. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review describes new literature regarding the improved success of the modified Valsalva maneuver as a nonpharmacologic therapy in PSVT. In addition, it describes a new technique in administration of adenosine that has improved outcomes, defines dose adjustments needed for drug interactions with adenosine, compares the utilization of nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with adenosine, and provides management recommendations for patients in special populations. CONCLUSIONS: With high annual rates of ED visits for SVT, providers should be aware of the data behind management and modifications of therapy based on patient-specific factors (ie, patient preference, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, drug interactions, and special populations).",0
Patient motivators to use opioids for acute pain after emergency care.,"INTRODUCTION: Patients are stakeholders in their own pain management. Factors motivating individuals to seek or use opioids therapeutically for treatment of acute pain are not well characterized but could be targeted to reduce incident iatrogenic opioid use disorder (OUD). Emergency departments (EDs) commonly encounter patients in acute pain for whom decisions regarding opioid therapy are required. Decision-making is necessarily challenged in episodic, unscheduled care settings given time pressure, limited information, and lack of pre-existing patient provider relationship. Patients may decline to take prescribed opioids or conversely seek opioids from other providers or non-medical sources. METHODS: Using a framework analysis approach, we qualitatively analyzed transcripts from 29 patients after discharge from an ED visit for acute pain at a large, urban, academic hospital in the midwestern United States to describe motivating factors influencing patient decisions regarding opioid use for acute pain. A semi-structured interview guide framed participant discussion in either a focus group or interview transcribed and analyzed with conventional content analysis. RESULTS: Four major themes emerged from our analysis including a) pain management literacy, b) control preferences, c) risk tolerance, and d) cues to action. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest targets for future intervention development and a framework to guide the engagement of patients as stakeholders in their own acute pain management.",0
miRNAs as cornerstones in chronic lymphocytic leukemia pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance- An emphasis on the interaction of signaling pathways.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) accounts for the vast majority of cases of leukemia. Patients of advanced age are more likely to develop the condition, which has a highly varied clinical course. Consideration of illness features and preceding treatment sequence, as well as patient preferences and comorbidities, is necessary for selecting the appropriate treatment for the appropriate patient. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity to detect CLL early, monitor CLL patients, select the treatment responders, and reduce ineffective treatment, unwanted side effects, and unnecessary expenses. In both homeostasis and illness, microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) play a vital role as master regulators of gene expression and, by extension, protein expression. MiRNAs typically reduce the stability of mRNAs, including those encoding genes involved in tumorigenesis processes as cell cycle regulation, inflammation, stress response, angiogenesis, differentiation, apoptosis, and invasion. Due to their unique properties, miRNAs are rapidly being exploited as accurate biomarkers for illness detection, and medicines based on miRNA targets are finding widespread application in clinical practice. Accordingly, the current review serves as a quick primer on CLL and the biogenesis of miRNAs. In addition to providing a brief overview of the miRNAs whose function in the progression of CLL has been established by recent in vitro or in vivo research through articulating the influence of these miRNAs on a wide variety of cellular functions, including increased proliferative potential; support for angiogenesis; cell cycle aberration; evasion of apoptosis; promotion of metastasis; and reduced sensitivity to specific treatments.",0
Impact of patient choice and hospital competition on patient outcomes after rectal cancer surgery: A national population-based study.,"BACKGROUND: The objective of the current national cohort study was to analyze the correlation between choice and competition on outcomes after cancer surgery in rectal cancer. METHODS: The analysis included all men who underwent rectal cancer surgery in the English National Health Service between March 2015 and April 2019 (n = 13,996). Multilevel logistic regression was used to assess the effect of a rectal cancer surgery center being located in a competitive environment (based on the number of centers within a threshold distance) and being a successful competitor (based on the ability to attract patients from other hospitals) on eight patient-level outcomes: 30- and 90-day emergency readmissions, 30-day re-operation rates, 90-day postoperative mortality, length of stay >14 days, circumferential resection margin status, rates of primary procedure with a permanent stoma, and rates of persistent stoma 18 months after anterior resection. RESULTS: With adjustment for patient characteristics, patients who underwent surgery in centers located in a stronger competitive environment were less likely to have an abdominoperineal excision or a Hartman's procedure (odds ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.97, p = .04). Additionally, individuals who received treatment at hospitals that were successful competitors had a lower risk of a 90-day readmission following rectal cancer surgery (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.97, p = .03) and were less likely to have a persistent stoma at 18 months after anterior resection (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.93, p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals located in areas of high competition are associated with better patient outcomes and improved processes of care for rectal cancer surgery.",0
Individualized Net Benefit estimation and meta-analysis using generalized pairwise comparisons in N-of-1 trials.,"BACKGROUND: The Net Benefit (Δ) is a measure of the benefit-risk balance in clinical trials, based on generalized pairwise comparisons (GPC) using several prioritized outcomes and thresholds of clinical relevance. We extended Δ to N-of-1 trials, with a focus on patient-level and population-level Δ. METHODS: We developed a Δ estimator at the individual level as an extension of the stratum-specific Δ, and at the population-level as an extension of the stratified Δ. We performed a simulation study mimicking PROFIL, a series of 38 N-of-1 trials testing sildenafil in Raynaud's phenomenon, to assess the power for such an analysis with realistic data. We then reanalyzed PROFIL using GPC. This reanalysis was finally interpreted in the context of the main analysis of PROFIL which used Bayesian individual probabilities of efficacy. RESULTS: Simulations under the null showed good size of the test for both individual and population levels. The test lacked power when being simulated from the true PROFIL data, even when increasing the number of repetitions up to 140 days per patient. PROFIL individual-level estimated Δ were well correlated with the probabilities of efficacy from the Bayesian analysis while showing similarly wide confidence intervals. Population-level estimated Δ was not significantly different from zero, consistently with the previous Bayesian analysis. CONCLUSION: GPC can be used to estimate individual Δ which can then be aggregated in a meta-analytic way in N-of-1 trials. GPC ability to easily incorporate patient preferences allow for more personalized treatment evaluation, while needing much less computing time than Bayesian modeling.",0
Patient and caregiver preferences for haemophilia treatments: A discrete-choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: An evolving haemophilia treatment landscape provides new possibilities for previously unattainable lifestyles. AIM: We sought to understand how people with haemophilia (PwH) and their caregivers value the potential benefits of novel prophylactic treatments. We conducted a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) to quantify preferences for features of haemophilia treatments among adults and caregivers of children with haemophilia. A best-worst scaling (BWS) exercise measured the perceived burden of treatment administration features. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was administered to male adults (≥18 years) and caregivers of male children (≤17 years) living with haemophilia in the United States. Respondents evaluated eight pairs of hypothetical haemophilia treatment profiles defined by six attributes in the DCE and 15 features in the BWS. RESULTS: In the DCE, both adults with haemophilia (n = 151) and caregivers (n = 151) prioritised avoiding the risk of developing inhibitor/ anti-drug antibodies and treatments that allowed for a more active life. They placed a lower priority on reducing the number of spontaneous bleeding episodes, route and frequency of administration, and avoiding the risk of hospitalisation due to adverse events. The BWS documented the burdensomeness of IV infusions and medications that require mixing and refrigeration. CONCLUSION: PwH and caregivers prefer treatments that enable a more active lifestyle with a lower risk of inhibitor development. Both groups valued the ability to lead an active life over reducing spontaneous bleeding, with caregivers placing the most weight on this attribute. As new treatments expand possibilities, healthcare professionals and PwH should continue to share decision-making, incorporating clinical judgment and individual preferences.",1
Improving Hands-Free Speech Rehabilitation in Laryngectomized Patients with a Moldable Adhesive.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the product performance of a new moldable peristomal adhesive with corresponding heating pad designed to facilitate and improve automatic speaking valve (ASV) fixation for hands-free speech in laryngectomized patients. METHODS: Twenty laryngectomized patients, all regular adhesive users with prior ASV experience, were included. Study-specific questionnaires were used for data collection at baseline and after two weeks of moldable adhesive use. The primary outcome parameters were adhesive lifetime during hands-free speech, use and duration of hands-free speech, and patient preference. Additional outcome parameters were satisfaction, comfort, fit, and usability. RESULTS: The moldable adhesive enabled ASV fixation adequate for hands-free speech in the majority of participants. Overall, the moldable adhesive significantly increased adhesive lifetime and duration of hands-free speech compared to participants' baseline adhesives (p < 0.05), regardless of stoma depth, skin irritation, or regular use of hands-free speech at baseline. The participants who preferred the moldable adhesive (55% of participants) experienced a significant increase in the adhesive lifetime (median of 24 h, range 8-144 h) and improved comfort, fit, and ease of speech. CONCLUSION: The moldable adhesive's lifetime and functional aspects, including the ease of use and custom fit, are encouraging outcomes and enable more laryngectomized patients to use hands-free speech more regularly. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 133:2965-2970, 2023.",0
Barriers to Optimal Clinician Guideline Adherence in the Management of Markedly Elevated Blood Pressure: A Qualitative Content Analysis of Electronic Health Records.,"IMPORTANCE: Hypertension poses a significant public health challenge. Despite clinical practice guidelines for hypertension management, clinician adherence to these guidelines remains suboptimal. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a taxonomy of suboptimal adherence scenarios for severe hypertension and identify barriers to guideline adherence. DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative content analysis using electronic health records (EHRs) of Yale New Haven Health System who had at least two consecutive visits between January 1, 2013, and October 31, 2018. SETTING: This was a thematic analysis of EHR data to generate a real-world taxonomy of scenarios of suboptimal clinician guideline adherence in the management of severe hypertension. PARTICIPANTS: We identified patients with markedly elevated blood pressure ([BP]; defined as at least 2 consecutive readings of BP ≥160/100 mmHg) and no prescription for antihypertensive medication within a 90-day of the 2(nd) BP elevation (n=4,828). We randomly selected 100 records from the group of all eligible patients for qualitative analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The scenarios and influencing factors contributing to clinician non-adherence to the guidelines for hypertension management. RESULTS: Thematic saturation was reached after analyzing 100 patient records. Three content domains emerged: clinician-related scenarios (neglect and diffusion of responsibility), patient-related scenarios (patient non-adherence and patient preference), and clinical complexity-related scenarios (diagnostic uncertainty, maintenance of current intervention and competing medical priorities). Through a metareview of literature, we identified several plausible influencing factors, including a lack of protocols and processes that clearly define the roles within the institution to implement guidelines, infrastructure limitations, and clinicians' lack of autonomy and authority, excessive workload, time constraints, clinician belief that intervention was not part of their role, or perception that guidelines restrict clinical judgment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study illuminates reasons for suboptimal adherence to guidelines for managing markedly elevated BP. The taxonomy of suboptimal adherence scenarios, derived from real-world EHR data, is pragmatic and provides a basis for developing targeted interventions to improve clinician guideline adherence and patient outcomes.",0

The Relative Importance of Factors That Applicants Weigh When Ranking Adult Reconstruction Fellowships as Well as Their Perspectives on Robotic-Assisted Arthroplasty.,"BACKGROUND: Orthopedic Surgery Fellowship programs offer highly specialized training that varies based on the training environment and surgical experience. Additionally, for Adult Reconstruction programs, robotic-assisted surgery exposure has been a widely discussed topic. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative value of various factors to Adult Hip and Knee Fellowship applicants, and their perceptions of robotic-assisted arthroplasty. METHODS: We surveyed 780 applicants who applied to our fellowship to matriculate in 2020 to 2024. We received 158 responses (20.3% response rate). We assessed factors concerning people and perceptions, logistics, salary and benefits, program reputation and curriculum, and surgical experience. Additionally, we surveyed fellows' attitudes toward using robotic surgery and its impact on patient outcomes. RESULTS: The highest-rated factors were Level of Hands-On Operative Experience (4.83), Revision Hip Volume (4.72), Revision Knee Volume (4.71), Multiple Surgical Exposures to the Hip (4.59), and Clinical Case Variety (4.59). Respondents who were postfellowship matriculation placed significantly more value on Exposure to Multiple Attendings with Surgical Diversity (P = .01), and Anterior Hip Volume (P = .04), and less value on Geographic Location (P = .04) and Patient-Specific Instrumentation (P = .02) than prematriculates. Overall, 65% of applicants plan to or currently use robotics, 7.6% do not, and 27.2% said ""Maybe"". Those who plan to or currently use robotics most cited procedure fidelity, patient-preference, and marketability as reasons to use robotics. CONCLUSIONS: Hands-on surgical experience and revision volume were the most important factors for fellowship applicants. Applicants placed lower importance on robotics exposure and their perspectives on robotics in their future practice were highly variable. Our results will inform fellowship programs and future applicants what previous applicants have valued in their training to help guide fellowship program structure, resource management, as well as recruitment.",0
"Getting to know our patients and what matters: exploring the elicitation of patient values, preferences, and circumstances in neurological rehabilitation.","PURPOSE: Patient values, preferences, and circumstances are critical to decision-making in both patient-centred and evidence-based practice models of healthcare. Despite the established importance of integrating these patient attributes, the ways they are elicited in rehabilitation remain unclear. This study aimed to explore how health professionals elicit and share patients' 'values', 'preferences', and 'circumstances', and what they understand by the terms. METHODS: This exploratory qualitative descriptive study used interviews with 13 clinicians from interprofessional teams in inpatient neurological rehabilitation. Data were analysed using a general inductive approach. RESULTS: Participants understood 'values' to mean what is important and meaningful; 'preferences' as likes/dislikes and choices; and 'circumstances' as the social, physical, and environmental context surrounding the person. Formal and informal strategies were used to gather information directly from patients or indirectly from other sources. The processes of eliciting and communicating this information were influenced by relationships and relied on contributions from many people. Elicitation involved a flexible approach tailored to the individual and considering each unique context. CONCLUSION: The strategies used and the approach used to implement these strategies were both essential to eliciting patient values, preferences, and circumstances in neurological rehabilitation. These findings offer insights into the practices of interprofessional rehabilitation clinicians. Implications for rehabilitationEliciting patient values, preferences, and circumstances involves a combination of strategies and approaches that are applied gradually throughout the continuum of rehabilitation.These processes are flexible, and strategies should be tailored to individual patients/families and phases of rehabilitation.Clinicians should be attentive to informal opportunities to gather valuable information throughout rehabilitation.Establishing positive relationships and using effective communication is foundational to these processes.",0
Preference of young adults for COVID-19 vaccination in the United Kingdom: a discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine preferences for COVID-19 vaccinations in the young adult population in the United Kingdom (UK). METHOD: A discrete choice experiment survey was conducted in UK young adults. Participants were asked to choose between two hypothetical vaccines the one they preferred the most. Vaccines were defined by five attributes (effectiveness, risk of side effects, duration of protection, number of doses, confidence in available evidence), identified following a systematic literature review and qualitative interviews with 13 young adults. A random parameters logit model, a latent class model, and subgroup analyses were used to identify preferences. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-nine respondents were included (70% women, mean age 23 years). All five attributes significantly influenced respondents' vaccination decisions. Respondents valued higher effectiveness, lower risk of side effects, longer protection duration, and a smaller number of doses. Based on the range of levels of each attribute, vaccine effectiveness was the most important attribute (relative importance 34%), followed by risk of side effects (32%), and duration of vaccine protection (22%). CONCLUSIONS: The five investigated vaccine attributes appear to play an important role in young adults' decision-making process. Results of this study may help health authorities designing appropriate strategies in future vaccines campaigns in the younger UK population.",1
Seizure Medications.,"The mainstay treatment strategy for seizures is medication management. However, much like the prescription of any other pharmaceutical agent, a clinician must balance efficacy with adverse events, and provide consideration for cost, drug interactions, patient preference, and availability. This activity outlines the indications, mechanisms of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of various seizure medications, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating indicated disorders as part of the interprofessional team with seizure medications, with a basis on the current knowledge for optimal utilization.",0
Acne characteristics in Latin American patients and the potential role of trifarotene.,"BACKGROUND: Individualization of treatment based on acne type and severity, location, disease burden, and patient preference is required to maximize efficacy, safety, and adherence to therapy. Latin American populations have unique attributes that must be considered as part of this process to improve clinical success and achieve patient goals. Acne is more common among patients with darker skin phototypes, in whom it is often associated with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring-the most important acne sequelae-potentially due to more frequent and more severe underlying inflammatory processes in this population. DISCUSSION: These data argue for an early and proactive approach to managing acne in these patients with agents that target the inflammatory processes that underlie acne and its sequelae. As a class, retinoids offer a spectrum of activity that may be useful in addressing the unique needs of Latin American populations. CONCLUSION: Trifarotene, a novel, selective retinoid, has been evaluated in relevant patient populations.",0
Experiences of and recommendations on clinical trial design in Alzheimer's disease from the participant's point of view: a mixed-methods study in two clinical trial centers in the Netherlands.,"INTRODUCTION: In the context of the development of pharmaceutical interventions, expectations and experiences of participants are essential. Their insights may be particularly helpful to address the challenges of recruiting and retaining participants for Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials. We examined clinical trial participants' experiences to optimize trial design in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHOD: In this mixed-methods study, we included adults who participated in sponsor-initiated AD trials at Brain Research Center, a clinical trial organization in the Netherlands. Participants (N = 71, age 69 ± 6.5, 54%F, 19 cognitively normal (CN), 19 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 33 AD dementia) first completed an online survey. Diagnostic group differences were investigated using chi-square tests or one-way ANOVAs. Next, a subsample (N = 12; 8 = CN, 4 = MCI) participated in focus groups to gain in-depth insight into their opinions on optimizing trial design from a participants' point of view. Audio recordings from focus group interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed by thematic content analysis by two independent researchers. RESULTS: Most reported motives for enrolment included ""to benefit future generations"" (89%), followed by ""for science"" (66%) and ""better monitoring"" (42%). Frequent suggestions for increasing willingness to participate included a smaller chance to receive placebo (n = 38, 54%), shorter travel times (n = 27, 38%), and sharing individual results of different assessments (n = 57, 80%), as well as receiving trial results (n = 52, 73). Highest visual analogue burden scores (0-100) were found for the lumbar puncture (M = 47.2, SD = 38.2) and cognitive assessments (M = 27.2, SD = 25.7). Results did not differ between diagnostic groups, nor between patient and caregiver participants (all p-values>.05). Two additional themes emerged from the focus groups: ""trial design,"" such as follow-up visit(s) after participating, and ""trial center,"" including the relevance of a professional and empathic staff. CONCLUSION: Relevant factors include expectation management and careful planning of high-burden assessments, provision of individual feedback, and prioritizing professionalism and empathy throughout conduct of the trial. Our findings provide insight into participants' priorities to increase willingness to participate and can be used to optimize trial success.",0
Patient and Public Acceptance of Digital Technologies in Health Care: Protocol for a Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Strokes pose a particular challenge to the health care system. Although stroke-related mortality has declined in recent decades, the absolute number of new strokes (incidence), stroke deaths, and survivors of stroke has increased. With the increasing need of neurorehabilitation and the decreasing number of professionals, innovations are needed to ensure adequate care. Digital technologies are increasingly used to meet patients' unfilled needs during their patient journey. Patients must adhere to unfamiliar digital technologies to engage in health interventions. Therefore, the acceptance of the benefits and burdens of digital technologies in health interventions is a key factor in implementing these innovations. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the development of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to weigh criteria that impact patient and public acceptance. Secondary study objectives are a benefit-burden assessment (estimation of the maximum acceptable burden of technical features and therapy-related characteristics for the patient or individual, eg, no human contact), overall comparison (assessment of the relative importance of attributes for comparing digital technologies), and adherence (identification of key attributes that influence patient adherence). The exploratory objectives include heterogeneity assessment and subgroup analysis. The methodological aims are to investigate the use of DCE. METHODS: To obtain information on the criteria impacting acceptance, a DCE will be conducted including 7 attributes based on formative qualitative research. Patients with stroke (experimental group) and the general population (control group) are surveyed. The final instrument includes 6 best-best choice tasks in partial design. The experimental design is a fractional-factorial efficient Bayesian design (D-error). A conditional logit regression model and mixed logistic regression models will be used for analysis. To consider the heterogeneity of subgroups, a latent class analysis and an analysis of heteroscedasticity will be performed. RESULTS: The literature review, qualitative preliminary study, survey development, and pretesting were completed. Data collection and analysis will be completed in the last quarter of 2023. CONCLUSIONS: Our results will inform decision makers about patients' and publics' acceptance of digital technologies used in innovative interventions. The patient preference information will improve decisions regarding the development, adoption, and pricing of innovative interventions. The behavioral changes in the choice of digital intervention alternatives are observable and can therefore be statistically analyzed. They can be translated into preferences, which define the value. This study will investigate the influences on the acceptance of digital interventions and thus support decisions and future research.

Co-creation of the Global Patient Experience Data Navigator: a multi-stakeholder initiative to ensure the patient voice is represented in health decision-making.,"BACKGROUND: Putting patients' needs and priorities at the forefront of healthcare initiatives and medical product development is critical to achieve outcomes that matter most to patients. This relies on the integration of early, meaningful patient engagement (PE) to learn what is important to patients, and collection of representative patient experience data (PXD). The increased number of PE/PXD efforts across global regulatory, health technology assessment, and healthcare systems is an important step forward to deliver improved health outcomes for patients. However, these initiatives are fragmented and lack integration, which is necessary to maximize efforts and reduce burden on patients. To overcome these challenges, the Global Patient Experience Data Navigator has been co-created by Patient Focused Medicines Development to provide practical resources that can facilitate and optimize PXD generation, collection, analysis, and dissemination for patient benefit and aims to be applicable across all therapeutic areas for all stakeholders. METHODS: Co-creation of the Navigator took place through an iterative process of validation and formalization driven by a diverse, multi-stakeholder working group with individuals who have varying knowledge/experience in PE/PXD. RESULTS: A series of workshops took place to conduct a gap analysis, develop a taxonomy model, and integrate existing frameworks. The collective insights led to the development of the Navigator consisting of four specific tools in the form of downloadable templates, which can be used to: (1) prioritize outcomes that matter most to patients and their caregivers; (2) select appropriate measurement methods for these outcomes; (3) identify when and why PXD is used throughout the product development cycle for each stakeholder; (4) identify when and why PXD is used throughout the healthcare process for each stakeholder. A public consultation was carried out to collect user feedback before the Navigator was made publicly available in December 2022. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, the Global Patient Experience Data Navigator is the only publicly available toolkit developed with a multi-stakeholder and disease-agnostic approach providing taxonomically grouped resources to optimize the collection and collation of PXD for patient benefit. Future work will aim to further engage patients by adding a PE dimension to the Navigator.",0
Preferences for Monitoring Comprehensive Heart Failure Care: A Latent Class Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To measure preference heterogeneity for monitoring systems among patients with a chronic heart failure. METHODS: A best-worst scaling experiment (BWS case 3) was conducted among patients with chronic heart failure to assess preferences for hypothetical monitoring care scenarios. These were characterized by the attributes mobility, risk of death, risk of hospitalization, type and frequency of monitoring, risk of medical device, and system-relevant complications. A latent class analysis (LCA) was used to analyze and interpret the data. In addition, a market simulator was used to examine which treatment configurations participants in the latent classes preferred. RESULTS: Data from 278 respondents were analyzed. The LCA identified four heterogeneous classes. For class 1, the most decisive factor was mobility with a longer distance covered being most important. Class 2 respondents directed their attention toward attribute ""monitoring,"" with a preferred monitoring frequency of nine times per year. The attribute risk of hospitalization was most important for respondents of class 3, closely followed by risk of death. For class 4, however, risk of death was most important. A market simulation showed that, even with high frequency of monitoring, most classes preferred therapy with high improvement in mobility, mortality, and hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Using LCA, variations in preferences among different groups of patients with chronic heart failure were examined. This allows treatment alternatives to be adapted to individual needs of patients and patient groups. The findings of the study enhance clinical and allocative decision-making while elevating the quality of clinical data interpretation.",1
The Role of Web-Based Adaptive Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis Technology in Eliciting Patients' Preferences for Osteoarthritis Treatment.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of using adaptive choice-based conjoint (ACBC) analysis to elicit patients' preferences for pharmacological treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), patients' satisfaction with completing the ACBC questionnaire, and factors associated with questionnaire completion time. METHODS: Adult patients aged 18 years and older with a medical diagnosis of OA, experiencing joint pain in the past 12 months, and living in the Northeast of England participated in the study. The participants completed a web-based ACBC questionnaire about their preferences regarding pharmaceutical treatment for OA using a touchscreen laptop independently, and accordingly, the questionnaire completion time was measured. Moreover, the participants completed a pen-and-paper feedback form about their experience in completing the ACBC questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty participants aged 40 years and older, 65% females, 75% had knee OA, and suffering from OA for more than 5 years participated in the study. About 60% of participants reported completing a computerized questionnaire in the past. About 85% of participants believed that the ACBC task helped them in making decisions regarding their OA medications, and 95% agreed or strongly agreed that they would be happy to complete a similar ACBC questionnaire in the future. The average questionnaire completion time was 16 min (range 10-24 min). The main factors associated with longer questionnaire completion time were older age, never using a computer in the past, and no previous experience in completing a questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: The ACBC analysis is a feasible and efficient method to elicit patients' preferences for pharmacological treatment of OA, which could be used in clinical settings to facilitate shared decision-making and patient-centered care. The ACBC questionnaire completion consumes a significantly longer time for elderly participants, who never used a computer, and never completed any questionnaire previously. Therefore, the contribution of patients and public involvement (PPI) group in the development of the ACBC questionnaire could facilitate participants' understanding and satisfaction with the task. Future research including patients with different chronic conditions may provide more useful information about the efficiency of ACBC analysis in eliciting patients' preferences for osteoarthritis treatment.",1
Assessing Patients' Preferences for Preventive Dental Care: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"Background It is crucial to recognize patients' behavioral responses to improve oral healthcare delivery. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) is typically used to measure service user preferences. The purpose of this study was to examine the preferences of the Saudi population regarding primary dental care using a DCE. Materials and methods An online DCE survey was distributed among adults aged 18 years and older living in Saudi Arabia. An orthogonal design was used to reduce the number of combinations while maintaining the main effects that reflect patient preferences. Respondents were presented with a reduced set of 10 cards (tasks), and each of the cards had two concepts (offers). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the sample characteristics. The coefficients were calculated based on discrete choice results on the Qualtrics platform. Results A total of 532 participants completed the survey. Among patients seeking a preventive dental visit, the ability to get an appointment was rated the most important influence on their decision with a relative importance of 41%, followed by the dental care provider (29%) and the dental clinic in relation to the sector and the fees (20%). The least important attribute was the waiting time in minutes, with a relative importance of 10%. Conclusion The study findings revealed that patients make trade-offs when deciding to receive primary dental care. Policymakers can use the study's findings to inform their decisions concerning dental clinic services. The study results suggest that it is possible to improve access to primary dental care by improving the accessibility of appointments.",1
Safety in Teletriage by Nurses and Physicians in the United States and Israel: Narrative Review and Qualitative Study.,"BACKGROUND: The safety of telemedicine in general and telephone triage (teletriage) safety in particular have been a focus of concern since the 1970s. Today, telehealth, now subsuming teletriage, has a basic structure and process intended to promote safety. However, inadequate telehealth systems may also compromise patient safety. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated rapid but uneven telehealth growth, both technologically and professionally. Within 5-10 years, the field will likely be more technologically advanced; however, these advances may still outpace professional standards. The need for an evidence-based system is crucial and urgent. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore ways that developed teletriage systems produce safe outcomes by examining key system components and questioning long-held assumptions. METHODS: We examined safety by performing a narrative review of the literature using key terms concerning patient safety in teletriage. In addition, we conducted system analysis of 2 typical formal systems, physician led and nurse led, in Israel and the United States, respectively, and evaluated those systems' respective approaches to safety. Additionally, we conducted in-depth interviews with representative physicians and 1 nurse using a qualitative approach. RESULTS: The review of literature indicated that research on various aspects of telehealth and teletriage safety is still sparse and of variable quality, producing conflicting and inconsistent results. Researchers, possibly unfamiliar with this complicated field, use an array of poorly defined terms and appear to design studies based on unfounded assumptions. The interviews with health care professionals demonstrated several challenges encountered during teletriage, mainly making diagnosis from a distance, treating unfamiliar patients, a stressful atmosphere, working alone, and technological difficulties. However, they reported using several measures that help them make accurate diagnoses and reasonable decisions, thus keeping patient safety, such as using their expertise and intuition, using structured protocols, and considering nonmedical factors and patient preferences (shared decision-making). CONCLUSIONS: Remote encounters about acute, worrisome symptoms are time sensitive, requiring decision-making under conditions of uncertainty and urgency. Patient safety and safe professional practice are extremely important in the field of teletriage, which has a high potential for error. This underregulated subspecialty lacks adequate development and substantive research on system safety. Research may commingle terminology and widely different, ill-defined groups of decision makers with wide variation in decision-making skills, clinical training, experience, and job qualifications, thereby confounding results. The rapid pace of telehealth's technological growth creates urgency in identifying safe systems to guide developers and clinicians about needed improvements.",0
Advance care planning-family carer psychological distress and involvement in decision making: the ACTION trial.,"OBJECTIVES: Facilitated advance care planning (ACP) helps family carers' to be aware of patient preferences. It can improve family carers' involvement in decision making and their overall experiences at the end of life, as well as, reduce psychological stress. We investigated the effects of the ACTION Respecting Choices (RC) ACP intervention on the family carers' involvement in decision making in the last 3 months of the patients' life and on the family carers' psychological distress after 3 months of bereavement. METHODS: Over six European countries, a sample of 162 bereaved family carers returned a bereavement questionnaire. Involvement in decision making was measured with a single item of the Views of Informal Carers-Evaluation of Services Short Form questionnaire. Psychological distress was measured with the Impact of Event Scale (IES). RESULTS: No significant effect was found on family carers involvement in decision making in the last 3 months of the patients' life (95% CI 0.449 to 4.097). However, the probability of involvement in decision making was slightly higher in the intervention arm of the study (89.6% vs 86.7%; OR=1.357). Overall, no statistical difference was found between intervention and control group regarding the IES (M=34.1 (1.7) vs 31.8 (1.5); (95% CI -2.2 to 6.8)). CONCLUSION: The ACTION RC ACP intervention showed no significant effect on family carers' involvement in decision making or on subsequent psychological distress. More research is needed about (1) how family carers can be actively involved in ACP-conversations and (2) how to prepare family carers on their role in decision making.

The effect of virtual reality glasses on dental anxiety during scaling and root planing in patients with periodontitis: A randomized controlled clinical trial.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of virtual reality distraction (VRD) on dental anxiety during scaling and root planing (SRP) in periodontitis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled split-mouth study included 60 patients who scored 9 or above on the dental anxiety scale (DAS) and required SRP in at least two quadrants with at least five teeth and two sites with a probing depth of ≥4 mm. Randomly chosen quadrants were treated using virtual reality glasses, and other quadrants were treated without glasses at the same visit. During VRD, a video of nature scenes was projected onto the screen in front of the patient's eyes. DAS and a visual analogue scale about patient feelings were applied at the end of the procedure. RESULTS: With VRD, the scale value of pain and discomfort level (VASP) was significantly reduced (p = 0.01, d = 0.57). Starting treatment without glasses significantly decreased VASP in both control and test sides (p = 0.00, d = 0.85; p = 0.00, d = 0.80, respectively) and increased the sensation of immersion and realism (p = 0.03, d = 0.45; p = 0.02, d = 0.46, respectively). Intraoperative and postoperative DAS values were significantly lower in patients who started treatment without VRD (p = 0.04, d = 0.34; p = 0.02, d = 0.44, respectively). Of the patients, 63.3% preferred VRD in the subsequent treatment. While patient preference did not correlate with sex, it correlated with age (r = -0.48, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The VRD and initiating SRP procedure with VRD affected the pain and discomfort level in anxious periodontitis patients. In addition, the anxiety level was also affected by starting the procedure with glasses.",0
Meeting the Needs of Patient Preferences in Imaging.,"Healthcare continues to transition toward a patient-centered paradigm, where patients are active in medical decisions. Fully embracing this new paradigm means updating how clinical guidelines are formulated, accounting for patient preferences for medical care. Recently, several societies have incorporated patient preference evidence in their updated clinical practice guidelines, and patients in their expert panels. To fully transition to a patient-centered-paradigm, imaging organizations should rethink the formulation of clinical guidelines, accounting for patient preference evidence.",0
Viewpoint: Nurses educating patients about drugs.,"Educating patients about the drugs they take is essential for them to take them safely and effectively. This education is now commonly given by nurses as part of the huge expansion in the nurse specialist role. However, training for this role has not kept pace with practice. Nurses have expressed variable confidence in this role and expressed a wish for more formal training. Current practice often puts the information rather than the patient at the centre of the consultation with the nurse dominating the conversation. Cues to address the patient agenda are commonly missed. An animated patient who interrupts is probably not having their educational needs met. Education of the professionals around how to perform this task in an optimal way is necessary and should result in better efficacy and safety of the drugs. This could be achieved by incorporating features of Shared Decision Making and the Calgary-Cambridge consultation techniques into training and the consultation. Personalisation by attention to patient preferences, language and health literacy is essential.",0
Should Antihypertensive Medications Be Routinely Administered in the Nighttime Instead of Daytime?,"The optimal timing for administering antihypertensive medications remains a topic of debate. This review examines the effectiveness of nighttime vs daytime administration of antihypertensive medications in controlling blood pressure (BP). The MAPEC and Hygia trials suggest that nighttime dosing achieves better BP control and significantly lowers cardiovascular events. However, concerns about methodology and generalizability have been raised. In contrast, the HARMONY and TIME trials found no significant difference in BP control nor cardiovascular outcomes between daytime and nighttime dosing. Current research suggests that the timing of antihypertensive medication administration may not be a crucial factor. Therefore, the decision about the timing of antihypertensive medications administration should be individualized, taking into account patient preference and clinical context, in order to promote consistent compliance.",0
A Preference-Based Value Assessment of the Fear of COVID-19 Contagion.,"PURPOSE: To assess the preference-based value of the fear of COVID-19 contagion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a web-based, cross-sectional discrete choice experiment among 544 US adults. We used a Bayesian efficient design to generate choice sets. Each choice set comprised two hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine options characterized by seven attributes: chance of COVID-19 infection, chance of having severe symptoms from COVID-19 infection, vaccine protection duration, chance of mild to moderate adverse events from vaccination, chance of serious adverse events from vaccination, chance of future exposure to COVID-19 after vaccination, and out-of-pocket cost. We used mixed logit (ML) and latent class (LC) models to analyze data. Furthermore, we calculated the willingness-to-pay for eliminating the chance of future exposure to COVID-19, shedding light on the value attributed to the fear of contagion. RESULTS: The ML model demonstrated all attributes, including the chance of future exposure to COVID-19, were statistically significant. The participants were willing to pay approximately $13,046 to eliminate the chance of future exposure to COVID-19 or their fear of contagion when COVID-19 was still pandemic. The LC model unveiled two participant classes with distinct preference weights for the chance of future exposure to COVID-19 and out-of-pocket cost attributes. Nevertheless, the chance of future exposure to COVID-19 exposure held a significant degree of importance in both classes. CONCLUSION: The chance of future exposure to COVID-19 exposure or fear of contagion was a significant element in the value assessment of COVID-19 vaccines. Further studies should be conducted to verify the value of fear of contagion and include it in the value assessment of healthcare technologies for infectious diseases.",1
The Ratings Game: Demographic and Practice Factors Affecting Yelp Ratings of Plastic Surgeons.,"BACKGROUND: Review platforms such as Yelp are increasingly used by patients establishing care and may contain substantial information regarding patient preferences and potential biases. The authors' aims were to (1) analyze patient satisfaction through identifying factors associated with positive and negative patient reviews for plastic surgery providers across the United States, and (2) investigate the association between overall rating and different physician and practice factors based on gender and race. METHODS: Reviews of plastic surgery provider practices from cities across seven different regions within the United States were obtained from Yelp. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed. Chi-square tests were used to determine whether race or sex was associated with overall rating (of five stars) and qualitative themes. RESULTS: A total of 5210 reviews met inclusion criteria; 80.3% received a five-star rating and 13.5% received a one-star rating. Positive Yelp reviews and higher ratings were associated with positive comments regarding surgical and injectable outcomes, physical examination, communication, competency/knowledge base, temperament, scheduling, and staff interactions. When the following factors were mentioned negatively, the practice was more likely to receive a lower rating: temperament, communication, cost consciousness, surgical and injectable outcomes, physical examination, billing/insurance, scheduling, interactions with staff, and wait times. No association was identified in terms of overall physician rating based on sex or race; however, there were differences noted in distribution of positive and negative themes. CONCLUSIONS: Patient reviews on Yelp indicate that several physician and practice factors influence patient satisfaction. The themes reported in this study may be used by plastic surgery providers to identify areas for practice improvement to enhance the overall patient experience.",0
Neck Rejuvenation.,"A common complaint of patients presenting for facial cosmetic evaluation is the appearance of aging in the neck. Specifically, vertical lines visible at the medial borders of the platysma muscles - known as platysmal bands - accumulation of fat in the submental area, and effacement of the cervicomental angle are frequently mentioned. Multiple options with varying degrees of invasiveness are available to address these concerns, such as neck lift with or without platysmaplasty, submental liposuction, deoxycholic acid injection, cryotherapy, botulinum toxin injection, and skin resurfacing, among others. Determining the appropriate treatment modality will depend on patient preference and goals, budget, general health, and underlying anatomy. Frequently, these procedures will be combined with other interventions, like face lifting and blepharoplasty, or dermal filler injections. Surgeons will often need to pair with allied healthcare personnel, such as injection nurses and aestheticians, in order to maximize patients' results and satisfaction.",0
Dietetic advocacy for long-term use of exclusive enteral nutrition resulted in high-risk surgical avoidance for complicated fibrotic Crohn's disease - A case report.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Surgery is often the only therapeutic option for the management of fibrotic Crohn's disease (FCD). Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN), a nutritionally complete liquid formula, is an effective, safe, short-term treatment for Crohn's Disease. No cases were found internationally of adults with FCD on long-term EEN. We report on clinical outcomes and self-reported quality of life (QoL) after longer-term EEN provision in a patient with complex FCD. METHODS: ""Billie"", a 54-year-old female, was admitted with ileal FCD diagnosed in 1985. Previous treatments were unsuccessful, including multiple bowel resections. Billie was chronically bedbound with pain and depression. CDAI (Crohn's disease activity index) score was 640 (<150) with ∼3-20 liquid stools/day, and recurrent partial bowel obstructions. Radiological findings were so severe surgeons reluctantly considered surgery but ""one more resection will result in short bowel syndrome"". Billie trialled EEN given her QoL was ""non-existent"". Unable to tolerate the taste, EEN was administered via nasogastric tube. After two months, EEN was administered ongoing via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy given patient preference and dietetic advocacy. RESULTS: After eight weeks on EEN, Billie's pain predominantly resolved, with bowel motions of ∼1-2/day, and nil bowel obstructions. Twelve months after EEN commencement, Billie's CDAI was 52, with 'no indication for surgical intervention' and was self-reporting that ""life is good"". After 18 months, Billie remains asymptomatic, and in clinical remission. CONCLUSION: This unique case is a wonderful example of dietetic advocacy and showcases the positive impact long-term EEN may have on surgical avoidance, clinical outcomes and self-reported QoL.",0
Patient and researcher stakeholder preferences for use of electronic health record data: a qualitative study to guide the design and development of a platform to honor patient preferences.,"OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study aimed to understand patient and researcher perspectives regarding consent and data-sharing preferences for research and a patient-centered system to manage consent and data-sharing preferences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted focus groups with patient and researcher participants recruited from three academic health centers via snowball sampling. Discussions focused on perspectives on the use of electronic health record (EHR) data for research. Themes were identified through consensus coding, starting from an exploratory framework. RESULTS: We held two focus groups with patients (n = 12 patients) and two with researchers (n = 8 researchers). We identified two patient themes (1-2), one theme common to patients and researchers (3), and two researcher themes (4-5). Themes included (1) motivations for sharing EHR data, (2) perspectives on the importance of data-sharing transparency, (3) individual control of personal EHR data sharing, (4) how EHR data benefits research, and (5) challenges researchers face using EHR data. DISCUSSION: Patients expressed a tension between the benefits of their data being used in studies to benefit themselves/others and avoiding risk by limiting data access. Patients resolved this tension by acknowledging they would often share their data but wanted greater transparency on its use. Researchers expressed concern about incorporating bias into datasets if patients opted out. CONCLUSIONS: A research consent and data-sharing platform must consider two competing goals: empowering patients to have more control over their data and maintaining the integrity of secondary data sources. Health systems and researchers should increase trust-building efforts with patients to engender trust in data access and use.",0
Contemporary surgical and procedural management of benign prostatic hyperplasia.,"Interventions for benign prostatic hyperplasia have evolved from transurethral resection of the prostate and simple prostatectomy to a myriad of office-based and operating-room procedures. The contemporary approach involves matching the right procedure to the right patient, choosing on the basis of prostate characteristics, patient preference, and urologist expertise. This review details currently available and guideline-backed surgical and procedural treatments.",0
Lifetime Management of Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis in the Era of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.,"Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular disease. Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) using mechanical valves has been the preferred treatment for younger patients, but bioprosthetic valves are gaining favour to avoid anticoagulation with warfarin. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was approved in recent years for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis in intermediate- and low-risk patients as an alternative to SAVR. The longer life expectancy of these groups of patients might exceed the durability of the TAVR or SAVR bioprosthetic valves. Therefore, many patients need 2 or even 3 interventions during their lifetime. Because it has important implications on the feasibility of subsequent procedures, the decision between opting for SAVR or TAVR as the primary procedure requires thorough consideration by the heart team, incorporating patient preferences, clinical indicators, and anatomic aspects. If TAVR is favoured initially, selecting the valve type and determining the implantation level should be conducted, aiming for positive outcomes in the index intervention and keeping in mind the potential for subsequent TAVR-in-TAVR procedures. When SAVR is selected as the primary procedure, the operator must make choices regarding the valve type and the potential need for aortic root enlargement, with the intention of facilitating future valve-in-valve interventions. This narrative review examines the existing evidence concerning the lifelong management of severe aortic stenosis, delving into available treatment strategies, particularly emphasising the initial procedure's selection and its impact on subsequent interventions.",0
The Impact of Substantial Improvements in HbA1c and Weight Loss on the Medication Preferences of People with Type 2 Diabetes.,"PURPOSE: To quantify the preferences of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) for treatment attributes of a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) versus an injectable GLP-1 RA medication profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Injection-naive people taking oral medications for T2D in the US and UK completed a web survey including a discrete choice experiment to quantify patients' preferences for five treatment attributes: delivery system, frequency of nausea, frequency of hypoglycemia, HbA1c reduction, and weight reduction. Attributes and levels were based on head-to-head clinical trial data of tirzepatide 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg versus semaglutide 1mg. Preference data were analyzed separately by country using multinomial mixed logit (MXL) models. MXL parameters were used to estimate the predicted preference for each tirzepatide dose versus semaglutide 1mg. Direct preferences for each dose of tirzepatide versus semaglutide 1mg were elicited. RESULTS: Participants (N=620) in the US (N=301) and UK (N=319) were 50.8% and 50.5% female with mean ages of 60.7 years and 58.9 years, respectively. The order and magnitude of relative attribute importance (RAI) scores differed between countries. HbA1c reduction (26.3%) had the greatest impact on US participants' preferences, and hypoglycemia (32.8%) did among UK participants. Attribute-level marginal utility results indicated preferences for greater HbA1c improvements, the single-use pre-filled pen, lower hypoglycemia, greater weight reductions, and lower frequency of nausea. Assuming the availability of only tirzepatide or semaglutide 1mg, the predicted preference for tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15mg) in the US is 95.6% (vs 4.4% for semaglutide 1mg) and in the UK was 86.3% (vs 13.7% for semaglutide 1mg). CONCLUSION: HbA1c reduction, frequency of hypoglycemia, and weight reduction are key drivers of preferences among people with T2D when considering medication options. Overall, people with T2D are likely to prefer the tirzepatide over the semaglutide 1mg medication profiles.",1
Exploring women's strong preference for women surgeons in breast healthcare.,"BACKGROUND: This study challenges the prevalent belief that surgical roles demand masculine traits, potentially limiting women's suitability for such positions. Contrary to this stereotype, we explored the hypothesis that in sensitive surgical procedures, where communal traits are valued, women patients might favor women surgeons. Two experimental studies investigated women's preferences for a man versus a woman surgeon in a breast exam and breast surgery. METHODS: In two studies we experimentally tested women's preferences for a man versus a woman surgeon for a breast exam (a noninvasive and non-complicated procedure), and breast surgery (an invasive and more complicated procedure). Study 2 delved into factors influencing these preferences, including patients' age, stereotypical perceptions of women surgeons as communal/warm, past negative experiences with men and women doctors, and previous body-related trauma. RESULTS: Women consistently preferred a woman surgeon for both procedures and expressed increased willingness to wait for an appointment with a woman surgeon. However, this preference was less pronounced for surgery than for an exam. Study 2 identified the stereotypical perception of women surgeons as communal/warm as the strongest predictor for this preference, along with previous negative experiences with men doctors and age. CONCLUSIONS: While some gender bias persists, this study underscores a notable preference for women surgeons in intimate medical services like breast exams or surgery. This preference holds practical implications for healthcare providers encouraging women's preventive checkups and offers insights for women medical students making residency choices.",0
Defining Need Amid Exponential Change: Conceptual Challenges in Workforce Planning for Clinical Genetic Services.,"Rapid growth in the volume of referrals to clinical genetics services in many countries during the past 15 years makes workforce planning a critical policy tool in ensuring that the capacity of the clinical genetics workforce is large enough to meet current and future needs. This article explores the distinctive challenges of workforce planning in clinical genetics and provides recommendations for addressing these challenges using a needs-based planning approach. Specifically, at least 3 features complicate efforts to estimate the need for clinical genetic services: the difficulty in linking many clinical genetic services to concrete health outcomes; the rapidly changing nature of genetic medicine, which creates intrinsic uncertainty about the appropriate level of service; and the heightened relevance of patient preferences in this context. Our recommendations call for needs-based planning studies to include an explicit definition of necessary care, to be flexible in considering nonhealth benefits, to err on the side of including services currently funded by health systems even when evidence about outcomes is limited, and to use scenario analysis and expert input to explore the impact of uncertainty about patients' preferences and future technologies on estimates of workforce requirements.",0
Patient and General Population Preferences Regarding the Benefits and Harms of Treatment for Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Patient preferences for treatment outcomes are important to guide decision-making in clinical practice, but little is known about the preferences of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient preferences regarding the attributed benefits and harms of systemic treatments for mHSPC and preference heterogeneity between individuals and specific subgroups. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted an online discrete choice experiment (DCE) preference survey among 77 patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) and 311 men from the general population in Switzerland between November 2021 and August 2022. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We evaluated preferences and preference heterogeneity related to survival benefits and treatment-related adverse effects using mixed multinomial logit models and estimated the maximum survival time participants were willing to trade to avert specific adverse effects. We further assessed characteristics associated with different preference patterns via subgroup and latent class analyses. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Patients with mPC showed an overall stronger preference for survival benefits in comparison to men from the general population (p = 0.004), with substantial preference heterogeneity between individuals within the two samples (both p < 0.001). There was no evidence of differences in preferences for men aged 45-65 yr versus ≥65 yr, patients with mPC in different disease stages or with different adverse effect experiences, or general population participants with and without experiences with cancer. Latent class analyses suggested the presence of two groups strongly preferring either survival or the absence of adverse effects, with no specific characteristic clearly associated with belonging to either group. Potential biases due to participant selection, cognitive burden, and hypothetical choice scenarios may limit the study results. CONCLUSIONS: Given the relevant heterogeneity in participant preferences regarding the benefits and harms of treatment for mHSPC, patient preferences should be explicitly discussed during decision-making in clinical practice and reflected in clinical practice guidelines and regulatory assessment regarding treatment for mHSPC. PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined the preferences (values and perceptions) of patients and men from the general population regarding the benefits and harms of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. There were large differences between men in how they balanced the expected survival benefits and potential adverse effects. While some men strongly valued survival, others more strongly valued the absence of adverse effects. Therefore, it is important to discuss patient preferences in clinical practice.",1
Patients' Preference for Participation in Medical Decision-Making: Secondary Analysis of the BEDSIDE-OUTSIDE Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Patients may prefer different levels of involvement in decision-making regarding their medical care which may influence their medical knowledge. OBJECTIVE: We investigated associations of patients' decisional control preference (DCP) with their medical knowledge, ward round performance measures (e.g., duration, occurrence of sensitive topics), and perceived quality of care measures (e.g., trust in the healthcare team, satisfaction with hospital stay). DESIGN: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled multicenter trial conducted between 2017 and 2019 at 3 Swiss teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients that were hospitalized for inpatient care. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was patients' subjective average knowledge of their medical care (rated on a visual analog scale from 0 to 100). We classified patients as active, collaborative, and passive according to the Control Preference Scale. Data collection was performed before, during, and after the ward round. KEY RESULTS: Among the 761 included patients, those with a passive DCP had a similar subjective average (mean ± SD) knowledge (81.3 ± 19.4 points) compared to patients with a collaborative DCP (78.7 ± 20.3 points) and active DCP (81.3 ± 21.5 points), p = 0.25. Regarding patients' trust in physicians and nurses, we found that patients with an active vs. passive DCP reported significantly less trust in physicians (adjusted difference, - 5.08 [95% CI, - 8.69 to - 1.48 points], p = 0.006) and in nurses (adjusted difference, - 3.41 [95% CI, - 6.51 to - 0.31 points], p = 0.031). Also, patients with an active vs. passive DCP were significantly less satisfied with their hospital stay (adjusted difference, - 7.17 [95% CI, - 11.01 to - 3.34 points], p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with active DCP have lower trust in the healthcare team and lower overall satisfaction despite similar perceived medical knowledge. The knowledge of a patient's DCP may help to individualize patient-centered care. A personalized approach may improve the patient-physician relationship and increase patients' satisfaction with medical care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03210987).",0
Immunotherapy in oncology and the kidneys: a clinical review of the evaluation and management of kidney immune-related adverse events.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are now widely used in the treatment of many cancers, and currently represent the standard of care for multiple malignancies. These agents enhance the T cell immune response to target cancer tissues, and have demonstrated considerable benefits for cancer outcomes. However, despite these improved outcomes, there are important kidney immune-related adverse events (iRAEs) associated with ICI. Acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis remains the most frequent kidney iRAE, however glomerular lesions and electrolytes disturbances are increasingly being recognized and reported. In this review, we summarize clinical features and identify risk factors for kidney iRAEs, and discuss the current understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms. We highlight the evidence basis for guideline-recommended management of ICI-related kidney injury as well as gaps in current knowledge. We advocate for judicious use of kidney biopsy to identify ICI-associated kidney injury, and early use of corticosteroid treatment where appropriate. Selected patients may also be candidates for re-challenge with ICI therapy after a kidney iRAE, in view of current data on recurrent rates of kidney injury. Risk of benefits of re-challenge must be considered on an individual considering patient preferences and prognosis. Lastly, we review current knowledge of ICI use in the setting of patients with end-stage kidney disease, including kidney transplant recipients and those receiving dialysis, which suggest that these patients should not be summarily excluded from the potential benefits of these cancer therapies.",0
"Understanding rural-urban differences in veterans' internet access, use and patient preferences for telemedicine.","BACKGROUND: The expansion of telemedicine (e.g., telephone or video) in the Veterans Health Administration (VA) raises concerns for health care disparities between rural and urban veterans. Factors impeding telemedicine use (e.g., broadband, digital literacy, age) disproportionally affect rural veterans. PURPOSE: To examine veteran-reported broadband access, internet use, familiarity with, and preferences for telemedicine stratified by residential rurality. METHODS: Three hundred fifty veterans with a VA primary care visit in March 2022 completed a 30-min computer-assisted telephone interview. The sampling design stratified veterans by residential rurality (i.e., rural or urban) and how primary care was delivered (i.e., in-person or by video). Counts and weighted percentages are reported. FINDINGS: After accounting for survey weights, 96.2% of respondents had in-home internet access and 89.5% reported functional connection speeds. However, rural- compared to urban-residing veterans were less likely to experience a telemedicine visit in the past year (74.1% vs. 85.2%; p = 0.02). When comparing telemedicine to in-person visits, rural versus urban-residing veterans rated them not as good (45.3% vs. 36.8%), just as good (51.1% vs. 53.1%), or better (3.5% vs. 10.0%) (p = 0.05). To make telemedicine visits easier, veterans, regardless of where they lived, recommended technology training (46.4%), help accessing the internet (26.1%), or provision of an internet-enabled device (25.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Though rural-residing veterans were less likely to experience a telemedicine visit, the same actionable facilitators to improve telemedicine access were reported regardless of residential rurality. Importantly, technology training was most often recommended. Policy makers, patient advocates, and other stakeholders should consider novel initiatives to provide training resources.",0
Contextual community epinephrine prescribing: Is more always better?,"OBJECTIVE: Prompt administration of epinephrine is first-line management of anaphylaxis. Although severe anaphylaxis may require more than 1 epinephrine dose, multiple epinephrine device packs may not be necessary for all patients at risk for allergic reactions. DATA SOURCES: A narrative review was used to describe key considerations to contextualize community epinephrine prescribing. RESULTS: Anaphylaxis has a lifetime prevalence of 1.6% to 5.1%. Meeting diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis is not required for epinephrine treatment of a severe allergic reaction. A ""1-2-3"" approach to anaphylaxis treatment is important to clearly relay central management steps: promptly administer a first dose of intramuscular epinephrine with proper positioning, and activate emergency medical services if immediate symptom resolution does not occur; consider a second dose of intramuscular epinephrine with consideration of oxygen administration and intravenous fluid if initial epinephrine response is not adequate; and consider a third intramuscular epinephrine dose together with consideration of intravenous fluid support and oxygen for continued lack of appropriate response. Although multiple epinephrine doses may be required to treat severe anaphylaxis, 90% of anaphylaxis cases do not require more than 1 epinephrine dose. A universal requirement for multiple epinephrine devices in patients without a history of anaphylaxis is not cost-effective. Patients without a history of anaphylaxis may be managed without multiple device prescriptions within a patient-preference sensitive paradigm of care. CONCLUSION: Anaphylaxis prevention involves appropriate education to avoid allergen triggers, recognize symptoms of an allergic reaction, rapidly access and administer intramuscular epinephrine, and appropriately activate emergency medical services when needed. For patients with previous anaphylaxis, particularly those who have required more than 1 dose of epinephrine to treat an allergic reaction, possessing multiple epinephrine devices is an important part of managing community anaphylaxis risk.",0
How do patients value features of biological medicine in rheumatoid arthritis? A discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to quantify the preference of the patients regarding biological DMARDs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients' preferences were assessed using a discrete choice experiment. Eighteen different surveys describing eight attributes were designed using experimental design methods. Each survey presented eight choice tasks with two options for patients to choose one. A conditional logit model was used to calculate relative importance and willingness to pay. Subgroup analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of the patients' characteristic on their preferences. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included in the study. All attributes had significant effects on the patients' choices. The most important feature was the ability to preserve physical function. The least important feature was the route of administration. Surprisingly, the out-of-pocket cost was one of the last priorities for respondents. According to the relative importance calculations, 80% of the patients' preferences can be obtained by clinical attributes. Based on subgroup analysis, the most important patient characteristic that affected their choices was the monthly out-of-pocket history. CONCLUSIONS: Different features of treatment had different effects on the patients' preferences. Quantification of the impact of each attribute not only revealed their relative importance but also determined the trade-off rate among them.",1
Oncoplastic Techniques and Tricks to Have in Your Toolbox.,"Oncoplastic breast reconstruction seeks to address partial mastectomy defects in the setting of breast-conserving surgery to achieve superior aesthetic outcomes with comparable oncologic safety compared with traditional breast conservation surgery. As such, oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery has grown in popularity in recent years. Several techniques have been used to displace the volume with the remaining breast tissue or replace it with local soft-tissue options, with decision-making guided by patient and tumor characteristics, additional treatment requirements, patient preference, and available tissue resources. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of considerations in oncoplastic breast reconstruction with a focus on techniques and tips to achieve optimal outcomes.",0
Mailing abortion pills does not delay care: A cohort study comparing mailed to in-person dispensing of abortion medications in the United States.,"OBJECTIVE: Given the substantial barriers to abortion access in the United States, many clinics now mail patients abortion medications. We examined whether dispensing the medications by mail prolonged time to medication use. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed data from no-test medication abortions with medication provided either by mail or in a clinic from 11 United States clinics from February 2020 to January 2021. We examined mean number of days from patients' first contact with the clinic to mifepristone ingestion, its two-component intervals (first contact to medication dispensing and dispensing to mifepristone ingestion), and pregnancy duration at mifepristone ingestion. We used Poisson regression to compare mean outcomes across three dispensing methods: in-person, mailed from the clinic, and mailed from a mail-order pharmacy. RESULTS: Among the 2600 records, patients took mifepristone on average at 49 days of gestation (95% CI, 47-51) and 7 days (95% CI, 4-10) after first contact. Mean time from first contact to mifepristone ingestion was 6 days when medications were dispensed in-person and 9 days when mailed (p = 0.38). While time from first contact to dispensing was similar across methods (6 days in-person, 5 days mailed, p = 0.77), more time elapsed from dispensing to mifepristone ingestion when medications were mailed (4 days from clinic, 5 days from mail-order pharmacy) versus dispensed in-person (0.3 days, p < 0.001). Time to mifepristone ingestion was shorter with higher pregnancy duration. Pregnancy duration at ingestion was similar across methods (48 days in-person, 50 days mailed). CONCLUSIONS: Mailing medications did not significantly prolong time from patients' first contact with the clinic to mifepristone ingestion or increase pregnancy duration at mifepristone ingestion. IMPLICATIONS: Abortion providers should offer a range of medication abortion dispensing options, prioritizing patient preference.",0
Ordering Eyeglasses Using 3D Head Scan Technology versus Established Online and Storefront Clinic Methods.,"SIGNIFICANCE: This study investigates how a new smartphone scanning technology compares with established online and storefront vendors in providing remote measurement and adjustment of prescription eyeglasses. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate a new technology for ordering prescription eyeglasses online. METHODS: Thirty participants with 2.00 to 2.75 D of presbyopia (aged 49 to 74 years) were asked to order eyeglasses with progressive addition lenses from four vendors: one online vendor using a new head scan technology (Topology, San Francisco, CA), two established Web site-based vendors (vendors A and B), and one storefront vendor: Université de Montréal's Vision Clinic (UMVC). The resulting measurements were compared with those of opticians. Participant-reported preferences on visual and physical comfort of eyeglasses were collected after 15-minute trials of eyeglasses from each vendor. RESULTS: Pupillary half-distance measured with Topology matched optician measurements, but online vendors A and B diverged (mean difference, - 0.80 mm [ Z = -2.79; P = .005]). Topology and vendor B segment addition heights were similar to optician measurements, but vendor A diverged (mean, -1.40 mm [ Z = -2.58; P = .01]). The personalization parameter values obtained with Topology were different from optician measurements for pantoscopic angle (-5.30° [ Z = -4.12; P < .001]) and face wrap angle (+1.25° [ Z = -2.94; P = .003]). The UMVC eyeglasses scored best for adjustment (8.71/10 [ Z = -5.53; P < .001]), with Topology coming second (7.23/10). Topology scores were equivalent to UMVC scores for all eight items of patient-reported preferences (nonparametric Friedman analysis of variance, P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Basic lens centration measurements obtained with Topology compare well with those of opticians, but some aspects of the methodology for measuring personalization parameters could be improved. In comparison with two established online vendors, resulting measurements with Topology are more consistent. Initial wearer satisfaction with Topology eyeglasses was also better.",0
Study protocol for a cross-sectional online survey investigating patient preferences and experiences of waiting for elective cardiac surgery.,"INTRODUCTION: Being on a waiting list for elective (planned) cardiac surgery can be physically and psychologically challenging for patients. Research suggests that stress associated with waiting for surgery is dependent on different individual and contextual factors. However, most data on patients' experiences of waiting for surgery and preferences for waiting list management derives from non-cardiac clinical populations. The aim of the current study is to explore patients' experiences of being on a waiting list for elective cardiac surgery, and their views on how the waiting experience could be improved in the future. This work will inform the patient management strategy during the waiting period for surgery across the four major hospitals in London directly involved in this study, and potentially beyond by transferring learning to other services. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a mixed-methods study that will collect quantitative and qualitative data using a cross-sectional online survey. Patients who are on waiting lists for elective surgery across four major cardiac surgery departments in London hospitals, and are at least 18 years old, will be invited by their healthcare team via text message or letter to complete the survey. The target sample size of non-randomly selected participants will be 268. Bivariable and multivariable regression models will be used to assess associations between survey items measuring the impact of the cardiac condition on specific life domains (eg, daily activities, social and family relationships, hobbies, sexual life), anxiety and depression symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 and survey items evaluating experiences of health services. Data on experience and preferences for improvements to the waiting experience will be analysed with qualitative content analysis using an inductive approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was reviewed and granted ethical approval by the East of England-East Cambridge Research Ethics Committee. Findings from this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, a research website and social media and with an online event engaging patients, members of the public, healthcare professionals and other relevant stakeholders. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMB: NCT05996640.",0
Effectiveness of digital care platform CMyLife for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia: results of a patient-preference trial.,"BACKGROUND: Two most important factors determining treatment success in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are adequate medication compliance and molecular monitoring albeit still being suboptimal. The CMyLife platform is an eHealth innovation, co-created with and for CML patients, aiming to improve their care, leading to an increased quality of life and the opportunity of hospital-free care. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effectiveness of CMyLife in terms of information provision, patient empowerment, medication compliance, molecular monitoring, and quality of life. METHODS: Effectiveness of CMyLife was explored using a patient-preference trial. Upon completion of the baseline questionnaire, participants actively used (intervention group) or did not actively use (questionnaire group) the CMyLife platform for at least 6 months, after which they completed the post-intervention questionnaire. Scores between the intervention group and the questionnaire group were compared with regard to the within-subject change between baseline and post-measurement using Generalized Estimating Equation models. RESULTS: At baseline, 33 patients were enrolled in the questionnaire group and 75 in the intervention group. Online health information knowledge improved significantly when actively using CMyLife and patients felt more empowered. No significant improvements were found regarding medication compliance and molecular monitoring, which were already outstanding. Self-reported effectiveness showed that patients experienced that using CMyLife improved their medication compliance and helped them to oversee their molecular monitoring. Patients using CMyLife reported more symptoms but were better able to manage these. CONCLUSIONS: Since hospital-free care has shown to be feasible in time of the COVID-19 pandemic, eHealth-based innovations such as CMyLife could be a solution to maintain the quality of care and make current oncological health care services more sustainable.

When should electronic medical records reminders for cancer screening stop?-Results from a national physician survey.,"BACKGROUND: Many older adults are screened for breast and colorectal cancers beyond guideline recommended thresholds. Electronic medical record (EMR) reminders are commonly used to prompt cancer screening. Behavioral economics theory suggests that changing the default settings for these reminders can be effective to reduce over-screening. We examined physician perspectives about acceptable thresholds for stopping EMR cancer screening reminders. METHODS: In a national survey of 1200 primary care physicians (PCP) and 600 gynecologists randomly selected from the AMA Masterfile, we asked physicians to choose whether EMR reminders for cancer screening should stop based on a list of criteria that included age, life expectancy, specific serious illnesses, and functional limitations. Physicians could choose multiple responses. PCPs were randomized to questions about breast or colorectal cancer screening. RESULTS: A total of 592 physicians participated (adjusted response rate 54.1%). 54.6% chose age and 71.8% chose life expectancy as criteria for stopping EMR reminders; only 30.6% chose functional limitations. Regarding age thresholds, 52.4% chose ages ≤75, 42.0% chose a threshold between 75 and 85, 5.6% would not stop reminders even at age 85. Regarding life expectancy thresholds, 32.0% chose ≥10 years, 53.1% chose a threshold between 5 and 9 years, 14.9% would not stop reminders even when life expectancy is <5 years. CONCLUSIONS: We found that many physicians would continue EMR reminders for cancer screening even in light of older age, limited life expectancy, and functional limitations. This may reflect reluctance to stop cancer screening and/or reluctance to stop EMR reminders so that physicians can retain control to decide for individual patients, for example, to assess patient preference and ability to tolerate treatment. There was consensus for stopping EMR reminders at ages 85+ and <5-year life expectancy. Interventions that seek to reduce over-screening by suppressing EMR reminders may be important for these groups but may have limited physician buy-in outside these thresholds.",0
Using Discrete Choice Experiments to Quantify Patient Preferences.,"Discrete choice experiments are a robust technique for quantifying preferences. With this method, respondents are presented with a series of hypothetical comparisons described by attributes with varying levels. The aggregated choices from respondents can be used to infer the relative importance of the described attributes and acceptable trade-offs between attributes. The data generated from discrete choice experiments can aid surgeons in aligning patient values with treatment decisions and support the design of research that is responsive to patient preferences. This article summarizes the application of discrete choice experiments to orthopaedics. We share best practices for designing discrete choice experiments and options for reporting study results. Finally, we suggest opportunities for this method within our field.",1
Barriers and enablers to deprescribing of older adults and their caregivers: a systematic review and meta-synthesis.,"PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to identify the barriers and enablers to deprescribing from the viewpoint of community-dwelling older adults and their caregivers. METHODS: This meta-synthesis included a systematic review of the literature and an inductive thematic synthesis. Medline and EMBASE were searched for studies that qualitatively explored the perspectives of older adults or their caregivers on deprescribing. Studies had to use qualitative methodologies and include community-dwelling adults (or their caregivers) aged 60 years or older who were taking one or more chronic medications. The quality of studies was assessed using the CASP tool. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in the meta-synthesis. All studies included older adults, and 3 included caregivers or companions. Four barriers were identified: favorable perceptions of medications, fear of medication discontinuation, the complexity of the healthcare system and discouragement from healthcare professionals; and seven enablers were identified: medication safety concerns, patient autonomy and confidence, education, follow-up, deprescribing strategies, relationships with physicians, and patient-perceived benefits of deprescribing. CONCLUSION: Multiple barriers and enablers to deprescribing exist within the older adult population. Health system complexity and direct discouragement from healthcare providers were barriers uniquely identified in the older adult population. This population would benefit from interventions to increase their medication literacy, confidence, and autonomy in the deprescribing journey.",0
Rivaroxaban versus Apixaban for Treatment of Cancer-Associated Venous Thromboembolism in Patients at Lower Risk of Bleeding.,"This retrospective study, utilizing U.S. electronic health record (EHR) data from January 2013 to December 2020, sought to assess whether rivaroxaban and apixaban had similar effectiveness and safety in the treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with a cancer type not associated with a high risk of bleeding. We included adults diagnosed with active cancer, excluding esophageal, gastric, unresected colorectal, bladder, noncerebral central nervous system cancers and leukemia, who experienced VTE and received a therapeutic VTE dose of rivaroxaban or apixaban on day 7 post-VTE, and were active in the EHR ≥12 months prior to the VTE. Primary outcome was the composite of recurrent VTE or any bleed resulting in hospitalization at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included recurrent VTE, any bleed resulting in hospitalization, any critical organ bleed, and composites of these outcomes at 3 and 6 months. Inverse probability of treatment-weighted Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We included 1,344 apixaban and 1,093 rivaroxaban patients. At 3 months, rivaroxaban was found to have similar hazard to apixaban for developing recurrent VTE or any bleed resulting in hospitalization (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.60-1.27). No differences were observed between cohorts for this outcome at 6 months (HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.71-1.40) or for any other outcome at 3 or 6 months. In conclusion, patients receiving rivaroxaban or apixaban showed similar risks of the composite of recurrent VTE or any bleed resulting in hospitalization in patients with cancer-associated VTE. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT05461807. Key Points Rivaroxaban and apixaban have similar effectiveness and safety for treatment of cancer-associated VTE through 6 months.Clinicians should therefore consider patient preference and adherence when choosing the optimal anticoagulant.",0
Clinical decision-making in older patients with cancer: a cross-sectional single-centre study to assess the impact of clinical judgement and patient preferences.,"OBJECTIVE: The heterogeneity in the population of older patients with cancer makes clinical decision-making difficult. We investigated the agreement between the G8 score and clinical judgment in frailty assessments, determined the impact of a life-expectancy calculator, and explored patient and caregiver preferences towards the treatment goal. METHODS: Patients aged ≥75 years in need of new oncological treatment were prospectively enrolled between June 2020 and February 2021. Frailty was estimated by the oncologist and caregiver and compared to the G8 estimation. We examined whether the oncologist changed the fit/frail estimation based on life expectancy calculated using the ePrognosis tool. The main treatment goals, either longevity or quality of life (QoL), from the patient's and caregiver's perspective were noted and compared. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were included in the analysis. Comparison of the oncologist's and the caregiver's frailty estimation with the G8 assessment showed agreement and a Kappa coefficient of 58.3% (0.231) and 60% (0.255), respectively. The ePrognosis score and the odds of change in the frailty estimation by the oncologist showed no correlation. Regarding preferences, 28 (57.1%) and 17 (34.7%) patients and eighteen (47.3%) and seventeen (44.7%) caregivers chose longevity and QoL, respectively. The observed agreement and Kappa coefficient were 78.8% and 0.578. CONCLUSION: Compared to the G8 assessment, frailty was underestimated by both oncologists and caregivers. Most of the patients chose longevity over QoL, and the preferences between the patient and the caregiver matched in the majority of cases.",0

Patient attitudes and preferences about expanded noninvasive prenatal testing.,"Introduction: Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is typically carried out to screen for common fetal chromosomal anomalies, with the option to screen for a wider range of chromosomal changes (expanded NIPT) becoming increasingly available. However, little is known about pregnant patients' attitudes and preferences regarding expanded NIPT. Methods: To address this gap, we surveyed general-risk patients having first-tier cfDNA screening at a private prenatal clinic on their expectations for expanded NIPT. Patients were asked questions regarding their current pregnancy and previous pregnancy history, their opinions on fetal DNA screenings during pregnancy and incidental findings, information and opinions on financial resources for NIPT, as well as socio-cultural questions to determine patient demographics. Results: Of the 200 survey participants, the majority were educated, self-reported as white, had a higher than average income, and reported no aneuploidy risk factors. When asked what information they would like to receive from cfDNA screening, the vast majority of participants wanted all information available that could have an immediate impact on fetal health (88%) or an immediate impact on infant health from birth (82%). Many participants also wanted information that could have a future impact on the child's health or an immediate or future impact on the pregnant woman's own health. Most participants wanted information about the sex of fetus (86%) and common trisomies (71%), with almost half of participants desiring information about rare autosomal aneuploidies and/or all genetic information that may affect the baby. In addition, participants were found to be comfortable screening for conditions that are well-known, influence care during pregnancy, and are treatable. Finally, while most respondents either had insurance coverage for NIPT or were able to afford NIPT out of pocket, the majority of our participants felt that expanded NIPT should be either free for everyone or for those considered high risk. Discussion: Our findings suggest that with appropriate pre-test counseling, pregnant patients may choose NIPT for an expanding list of conditions.",0
Shifting quality chronic pain treatment measures from processes to outcomes.,"OBJECTIVE: Misapplication of the 2016 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) opioid prescribing guidelines has led to overem-phasis of morphineequivalent daily dose (MEDD) as a ""metric of success"" in chronic noncancer pain (CNCP), resulting in unintentional harms to patients. This article reviews CNCP-related guidelines and patient preferences in order to identify pragmatic, patient-centered metrics to assess treatment response and safety in opioid-treated CNCP. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical (CDC), research (Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials), and implementability-related guidelines (GuideLine Implementability Appraisal), along with relevant patient-identified treatment goals. From these, we summarize a guideline-concordant, patient-centered, implementable set of measures to aid the clinical management of opioid-treated CNCP. RESULTS: We identify metrics across three domains of care: (1) treatment response metrics, which align with the CNCP care goals (pain intensity, pain interference including function and quality of life, and global impression of change); (2) risk assessment (""safety"") metrics, eg, MEDD, benzodiazepine-opioid or naloxone-opioid coprescribing, and severity of mental health disorders, which evaluate the risk-benefit profile of opioid therapy; and (3) adherence (""process"") metrics, which assess clinician/patient adherence to the guideline-recommended opioid therapy monitoring practices, eg, the presence of completed treatment agreement or urine toxicology testing. All metrics should be informed by implementability principles, eg, be decidable, executable, and measurable. CONCLUSIONS: This article summarizes guideline-concordant, patient-centered, implementable metrics for assessing treatment response, safety, and adherence in opioid-treated CNCP. Regardless of which specific treatment guidelines are applied, this approach could help conceptualize and standardize the collection and reporting of CNCP-relevant metrics, compare them across health systems, and optimize care and treatment outcomes in opioid-treated CNCP.",0
Visual performance and patient preference with bilateral implantation of an extended depth of focus or combined implantation of an extended depth of focus/trifocal intraocular lens.,"PURPOSE: Evaluate postoperative visual performance in patients with bilaterally implanted AT LARA or AT LARA/AT LISA tri (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany) intraocular lenses. METHODS: Multicentered, comparative, open-label, retrospective/prospective study. Post-IOL implantation, patients were prospectively enrolled into this study; preoperative patient data were collected retrospectively. Follow-up was at 2-4 and 5-8 months post-surgery. The primary endpoint was binocular best corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA). The study was retrospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT05462067). RESULTS: Seventy-one patients (142 eyes) were enrolled; 67 patients (134 eyes) have 5-8 months data. The mean binocular CDVA at 2-4 months was -0.10 ± 0.06 logMAR in the bilateral AT LARA group (""bilateral"") and -0.11 ± 0.09 logMAR in the combined implantation AT LARA/ AT LISA tri group (""combined implantation""); (P = 0.4856). At 5-8 months, mean binocular CDVA was -0.13 ± 0.06 logMAR in the bilateral group and -0.11 ± 0.09 in the combined implantation group (P = 0.4003). At 5-8 months, more eyes in the bilateral group attained 0.2 logMAR or better binocular uncorrected intermediate VA (UIVA; 67 cm) than those in the combined implantation group (100% vs. 94%, respectively). The bilateral group achieved a mean of 0.24 ± 0.11 logMAR in uncorrected near VA (UCNVA), compared to a mean of 0.16 ± 0.12 logMAR in the combined implantation group at 5-8 months (P = 0.0041). CONCLUSIONS: A combined implantation approach (AT LARA in the distance dominant eye/AT LISA tri in the non-dominant eye) produced similar CDVA outcomes but better UCNVA as bilateral implantation with the AT LARA. UIVA was comparable between groups. No new safety concerns were reported.",0
Co-Design of an Evidence-Based Practice Continuing Education Course for Canadian Naturopathic Doctors.,"Objectives: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is a clinical decision-making process combining the best available scientific evidence with clinician expertise and patient preference. While EBP has been associated with a range of benefits, it is recognized that EBP is used suboptimally by a range of health professionals, including naturopathic doctors (NDs). Canadian NDs have expressed a high level of interest in opportunities to improve their EBP skills; however, barriers exist, including those that apply broadly to health professionals, and those that are unique to the naturopathic profession. The objective of the present project was to co-design an EBP continuing education (CE) course tailored to the needs and preferences of Canadian NDs. Design: These needs were solicited through the use of focus groups. Groups were stratified based on participants' use of evidence at baseline. The focus groups asked NDs about their definition of EBP, and their interest in an EBP course, including preferred content, and method of delivery. The focus group discussions were transcribed, and thematic analysis was completed. Subjects: Twenty-two Canadian NDs participated. Results: Participants reported a high level of understanding of EBP, a high level of interest in participating in an EBP course and provided actionable recommendations about course content and delivery. Some of the themes that emerged were consistent across the groups while others differed by stratification. Conclusions: The findings of this project will inform the development and evaluation of a future CE course.",0
Surgeon preference for treatment allocation in older people facing major gastrointestinal surgery: an application of the discrete choice experiment methodology.,"AIM: Variation in major gastrointestinal surgery rates in the older population suggests heterogeneity in surgical management. A higher prevalence of comorbidities, frailty and cognitive impairments in the older population may account for some variation. The aim of this study was to determine surgeon preference for major surgery versus conservative management in hypothetical patient scenarios based on key attributes. METHOD: A survey was designed according to the discrete choice methodology guided by a separate qualitative study. Questions were designed to test for associations between key attributes (age, comorbidity, urgency of presentation, pathology, functional and cognitive status) and treatment preference for major gastrointestinal surgery versus conservative management. The survey consisting of 18 hypothetical scenarios was disseminated electronically to UK gastrointestinal surgeons. Binomial logistic regression was used to identify associations between the attributes and treatment preference. RESULTS: In total, 103 responses were received after 256 visits to the questionnaire site (response rate 40.2%). Participants answered 1847 out of the 1854 scenarios (99.6%). There was a preference for major surgery in 1112/1847 (60.2%) of all scenarios. Severe comorbidities (OR 0.001, 95% CI 0.000-0.030; P = 0.000), severe cognitive impairment (OR 0.001, 95% CI 0.000-0.033; P = 0.000) and age 85 years and above (OR 0.028, 95% CI 0.005-0.168; P = 0.000) were all significant in the decision not to offer major gastrointestinal surgery. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated variation in surgical treatment preference according to key attributes in hypothetical scenarios. The development of fitness-stratified guidelines may help to reduce variation in surgical practice in the older population.",0
Vaginal dryness: a review of current understanding and management strategies.,"The issue of vaginal dryness in genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and its pervasive impact on women's quality of life is often overlooked. Extensive surveys conducted worldwide reveal limited understanding of vaginal dryness among public and health-care providers. Physician knowledge on menopause medicine varies globally, highlighting the need for standardized training. Effective communication between physicians and patients plays a crucial role in diagnosing and treating GSM symptoms. There are multiple treatment options to improve vaginal lubrication, including hormonal and non-hormonal therapies, along with lifestyle modifications. Tailoring treatments to individual patient preferences is crucial for compliance. Overall, GSM is multifaceted, from the prevalence of vaginal dryness to the nuances of treatment preferences. The urgency of widespread education and awareness of this matter must be underscored to meet the aim of enhancing the well-being and quality of life for women.",0
Patient Preferences for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treatments: A Discrete-Choice Experiment.,"Treatments for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have varying benefit-risk profiles. We elicited 200 US patients' preferences for attributes associated with various first-line systemic treatments for unresectable HCC in a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey. Respondents answered nine DCE questions, each offering a choice between two hypothetical treatment profiles defined by six attributes with varying levels: overall survival (OS), months of maintained daily function, severity of palmar-plantar syndrome, severity of hypertension, risk of digestive-tract bleeding, and mode and frequency of administration. A random-parameters logit model was used to analyze the preference data. Patients regarded an additional 10 months of maintaining daily function without decline to be as important or more important than 10 additional months of OS, on average. Respondents valued avoiding moderate-to-severe palmar-plantar syndrome and hypertension more than extended OS. A respondent would require >10 additional months of OS (the greatest increase presented in the study) on average to offset the increased burden of adverse events. Patients with unresectable HCC prioritize avoiding adverse events that would severely impact their quality of life over mode and frequency of administration or digestive-tract bleeding risk. For some patients with unresectable HCC, maintaining daily functioning is as important or more important than the survival benefit of a treatment.",1
Interprofessional education for shared decision making in drug therapy: a scoping review.,"The current complex scenario of medication use calls for the implementation of interprofessional education (IPE) initiatives focused on shared decision making (SDM) in drug therapy. A scoping review was conducted to collate, summarize, and report the evidence available on IPE teaching and learning approaches in this context, involving pre-licensure healthcare students. Searches were conducted in seven electronic databases, with 21 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. This review examines educational strategies employed for interprofessional SDM as well as characteristics of students, teachers, and tutors involved in IPE interventions. The reviewed studies lack detailed description of the students' decision-making process, and none addresses aspects related to patient preferences as a part of learning outcomes. We identified shortcomings in how IPE interventions are assessed and reported. Only a few of the studies explicitly describe the use of competency-based frameworks proposed by national and international organizations, and less than 60% describe learning outcomes. The absence of experiences focused on interprofessional SDM in drug therapy suggests a gap that needs to be addressed with future studies evaluated in a robust way. We argue that such experiences enable students, as a team, to learn to share decisions with the patient as an effective team member.",0
Effect of standardised surgical assessment and shared decision-making on morbidity and patient satisfaction after breast conserving therapy: A cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: The role of oncoplastic breast conserving therapy (OPBCT) on physical function, morbidity and patient satisfaction has yet to be defined. Additionally, technique selection should be individualised and incorporate patient preference. The study aim was to investigate differences between ""standard"" (sBCT) and oncoplastic breast conservation (OPBCT) in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) when patients have been assessed in a standardised manner and technique selection has been reached through shared decision-making (SDM). METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 215 women treated at a tertiary referral centre. Standardised surgical assessment included breast and lesion volumetry, definition of resection ratio, patient-related risk factors and patient preference. Postoperative morbidity and patient satisfaction were assessed by validated PROs tools (Diseases of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand-DASH and Breast-Q). Patient experience was assessed by semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: There was no difference of the median values between OPBCT and sBCT in postoperative morbidity of the upper extremity (DASH 3.3 vs 5, p = 0.656) or the function of the chest wall (Breast-Q 82 vs 82, p = 0.758). Postoperative satisfaction with breasts did not differ either (Breast-Q 65 vs 61, p = 0.702). On the individual level, women that opted for OPBCT after SDM had improved satisfaction when compared to baseline (+3 vs -1, p = 0.001). Shared decision-making changed patient attitude in 69.8% of patients, leading most often to de-escalation from mastectomy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support that a combination of standardised surgical assessment and SDM allows for tailored treatment and de-escalation of oncoplastic surgery without negatively affecting patient satisfaction and morbidity.",0
Telehealth adoption in cancer clinical trials: An Australian perspective.,"INTRODUCTION: Cancer clinical trials have traditionally occurred in-person. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced adaptions of all aspects of cancer care (including clinical trials) so they can be delivered remotely. We aimed to quantify and qualify current use of telehealth and how it can be further improved and routinely integrated into cancer clinical trials in Australia. METHODS: We used a mixed-method study design, involving surveys of 14 multi-site Collaborative Cancer Clinical Trial Groups members across Australia (n = 98) and qualitative interviews with trial administrators and clinicians (n = 21). RESULTS: The results of our study indicated a strong willingness to use telehealth for certain transactions of clinical trials because it was perceived as a way of increasing efficiency and reach of services. Hybrid models (including telehealth and in-person methods), which considered transaction, cancer type, and patient preferences were most favorable. Additionally, telehealth allowed for greater equity to access and reduced trial burden but interestingly had little effect on increased diversity and recruitment. Factors influencing telehealth service implementation and uptake included communication among trial stakeholders, training, and learning from the experience of others in the clinical trials community. CONCLUSION: Many but not all aspects of clinical trial care are appropriate to be delivered via telehealth. A hybrid approach provides flexibility to trial delivery and may support greater equity of access to trials in the future. Our findings and actionable recommendations support the need for greater planning, training, and guidelines to enable telehealth to be better integrated into clinical trials. Opportunities exist to expand the use of remote patient monitoring to enable more objective data collection from trial participants in the future.",0
Telehealth Complementary and Integrative Health Therapies During COVID-19 at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.,"Background: Complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies, such as in-person acupuncture, chiropractic care, and meditation, are evidence-based nonpharmaceutical treatment options for pain. During COVID-19, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) delivered several CIH therapies virtually. This study explores veterans' utilization, advantages/disadvantages, and delivery issues of yoga, Tai Chi, meditation/mindfulness (self-care), and massage, chiropractic, and acupuncture (practitioner-delivered care), using telephone/video at 18 VA sites during COVID-19. Methods: Use of virtual care was examined quantitatively with VA administrative data for six CIH therapies before and after COVID-19 onset (2019-2021). Advantages/disadvantages and health care delivery issues of these CIH therapies through virtual care were examined qualitatively using interview data (2020-2021). Results: Overall, televisits represented a substantial portion of all CIH self-care therapies delivered by VA in 2020 (53.7%) and 2021 (82.1%), as sites developed virtual group classes using VA secure online video platforms in response to COVID-19. In contrast, a small proportion of all encounters with acupuncturists, chiropractors, and massage therapists was telephone/video encounters in 2020 (17.3%) and in 2021 (5.4%). These were predominantly one-on-one care in the form of education, follow-ups, home exercises, assessments/evaluations, or acupressure. Delivery issues included technical difficulties, lack of access to needed technology, difficulty tracking virtual visits, and capacity restrictions. Advantages included increased access to self-care, increased patient receptivity to engaging in self-care, and flexibility in staffing online group classes. Disadvantages included patient preference, patient safety, and strain on staffing. Conclusion: Despite delivery issues or disadvantages of tele-CIH self-care, veterans' use of teleself-care CIH therapies grew substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
Artificial Intelligence in Health Care-Understanding Patient Information Needs and Designing Comprehensible Transparency: Qualitative Study.,"BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) is as a branch of computer science that uses advanced computational methods such as machine learning (ML), to calculate and/or predict health outcomes and address patient and provider health needs. While these technologies show great promise for improving healthcare, especially in diabetes management, there are usability and safety concerns for both patients and providers about the use of AI/ML in healthcare management. OBJECTIVES: To support and ensure safe use of AI/ML technologies in healthcare, the team worked to better understand: 1) patient information and training needs, 2) the factors that influence patients' perceived value and trust in AI/ML healthcare applications; and 3) on how best to support safe and appropriate use of AI/ML enabled devices and applications among people living with diabetes. METHODS: To understand general patient perspectives and information needs related to the use of AI/ML in healthcare, we conducted a series of focus groups (n=9) and interviews (n=3) with patients (n=40) and interviews with providers (n=6) in Alaska, Idaho, and Virginia. Grounded Theory guided data gathering, synthesis, and analysis. Thematic content and constant comparison analysis were used to identify relevant themes and sub-themes. Inductive approaches were used to link data to key concepts including preferred patient-provider-interactions, patient perceptions of trust, accuracy, value, assurances, and information transparency. RESULTS: Key summary themes and recommendations focused on: 1) patient preferences for AI/ML enabled device and/or application information; 2) patient and provider AI/ML-related device and/or application training needs; 3) factors contributing to patient and provider trust in AI/ML enabled devices and/or application; and 4) AI/ML-related device and/or application functionality and safety considerations. A number of participant (patients and providers) recommendations to improve device functionality to guide information and labeling mandates (e.g., links to online video resources, and access to 24/7 live in-person or virtual emergency support). Other patient recommendations include: 1) access to practice devices; 2) connection to local supports and reputable community resources; 3) simplified display and alert limits. CONCLUSION: Recommendations from both patients and providers could be used by Federal Oversight Agencies to improve utilization of AI/ML monitoring of technology use in diabetes, improving device safety and efficacy.",0
Treatment of Granulomatous Inflammation in Pulmonary Sarcoidosis.,"The management of pulmonary sarcoidosis is a complex interplay of disease characteristics, the impact of medications, and patient preferences. Foremost, it is important to weigh the risk of anti-granulomatous treatment with the benefits of lung preservation and improvement in quality of life. Because of its high spontaneous resolution rate, pulmonary sarcoidosis should only be treated in cases of significant symptoms due to granulomatous inflammation, lung function decline, or substantial inflammation on imaging that can lead to irreversible fibrosis. The longstanding basis of treatment has historically been corticosteroid therapy for the control of granulomatous inflammation. However, several corticosteroid-sparing options have increasing evidence for use in refractory disease, inability to taper steroids to an acceptable dose, or in those with toxicity to corticosteroids. Treatment of sarcoidosis should be individualized for each patient due to the heterogeneity of the clinical course, comorbid conditions, response to therapy, and tolerance of medication side effects.",0

"Discrepancy in responses to the surprise question between hemodialysis nurses and physicians, with focus on patient clinical characteristics: A comparative study.","INTRODUCTION: The surprise question (SQ) ""Would I be surprised if this patient died within the next xx months"" can be used by different professions to foresee the need of serious illness conversations in patients approaching end of life. However, little is known about the different perspectives of nurses and physicians in responses to the SQ and factors influencing their appraisals. The aim was to explore nurses' and physicians' responses to the SQ regarding patients on hemodialysis, and to investigate how these answers were associated with patient clinical characteristics. METHODS: This comparative cross-sectional study included 361 patients for whom 112 nurses and 15 physicians responded to the SQ regarding 6 and 12 months. Patient characteristics, performance status, and comorbidities were obtained. Cohen's kappa was used to analyze the interrater agreement between nurses and physicians in their responses to the SQ and multivariable logistic regression was applied to reveal the independent association to patient clinical characteristics. FINDINGS: Proportions of nurses and physicians responding to the SQ with ""no, not surprised"" was similar regarding 6 and 12 months. However, there was a substantial difference concerning which specific patient the nurses and physicians responded ""no, not surprised"", within 6 (κ = 0.366, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.288-0.474) and 12 months (κ = 0.379, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.281-0.477). There were also differences in the patient clinical characteristics associated with nurses' and physicians' responses to the SQ. DISCUSSION: Nurses and physicians have different perspectives in their appraisal when responding to the SQ for patients on hemodialysis. This may reinforce the need for communication and discussion between nurses and physicians to identify the need of serious illness conversations in patients approaching the end of life, in order to adapt hemodialysis care to patient preferences and needs.",0
The Impact of Video-Based Educational Materials with Voiceovers on Preferences for Glucose Monitoring Technology in Patients with Diabetes: A Randomised Study.,"INTRODUCTION: Ensuring patients have enough information about healthcare choices prior to completing a preference study is necessary to support the validity of the findings. Patients are commonly informed using text-based information with supporting graphics. Video-based information may be more engaging for the general patient population. This study aimed to assess (1) the impact that educating patients using video-based educational materials with a voiceover has on patient preferences compared to traditional text, and (2) whether this impact is consistent between two countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A video-based educational tool was developed to inform patients prior to completing a discrete choice experiment assessing preferences for glucose monitors. Patients with diabetes from the Netherlands and Poland were recruited through an online research panel. Respondents were randomised to receive information in either a text or a video with animations and a voiceover. Data were analysed using a mixed-logit model. RESULTS: N = 981 completed surveys were analysed from the Netherlands (n = 459) and Poland (n = 522). Differences were found between the countries, but no interpretable pattern of differences was found between the two types of educational materials. Patients spent less time in the educational material than would be necessary to fully review all of the content. CONCLUSIONS: Simply providing educational material in a video with animations and voiceovers does not necessarily lead to better engagement from respondents or different preference outcomes in a sample of diabetes patients when compared to text. Increasing engagement with educational materials should be a topic of future research for those conducting patient preference research as no amount of educational material will be helpful if respondents do not access it.",1
Effective Use of Bromelain and Acetylcysteine (BromAc(®)) for Treatment of Perigastric Pseudomyxoma Peritonei: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare clinical condition of progressive peritoneal mucin accumulation. PMP has a reasonable survivability but with a notable risk of tumour recurrence. Standard treatment, including for tumour relapse, aims for a cure with complete cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. In the case of tumour recurrence, surgery becomes progressively complex, and some patients are not suitable for surgery either due to patient preference or morbidity and mortality risk. BromAc(®) is an emerging, novel mucolytic combination therapy composed of bromelain and acetylcysteine which can be administered intratumorally via radiologically guided drains. It represents a minimally invasive treatment for patients who have symptomatic tumour deposits but are not surgical candidates. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 64-year-old male with a background of appendiceal PMP who presented with a gastric outlet obstruction from a perigastric tumour deposit. This was managed with BromAc(®) administration, following which the patient's symptoms resolved. This corresponded with an 80% reduction in the tumour volume radiologically. CONCLUSION: BromAc(®) is an emerging minimally invasive treatment for PMP tumour deposits that may be considered as adjunctive or alternative treatment in patients who are not surgical candidates to reduce tumour burden and improve symptomatology and quality of life.",0
"Effectiveness, reach, uptake, and feasibility of digital health interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.","BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions have shown promising results for the management of type 2 diabetes, but a comparison of the effectiveness and implementation of the different modes is not currently available. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of SMS, smartphone application, and website-based interventions on improving glycaemia in adults with type 2 diabetes and report on their reach, uptake, and feasibility. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo on May 25, 2022, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of digital health interventions in reducing glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) in adults with type 2 diabetes, published in English from Jan 1, 2009. Screening was carried out using Covidence, and data were extracted following Cochrane's guidelines. The primary endpoint assessed was the change in the mean (and 95% CI) plasma concentration of HbA(1c) at 3 months or more. Cochrane risk of bias 2 was used to assess risk of bias. Data on reach, uptake, and feasibility were summarised narratively and data on HbA(1c) reduction were synthesised in a meta-analysis. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria was used to evaluate the level of evidence. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021247845. FINDINGS: Of the 3236 records identified, 56 RCTs from 24 regions (n=11 486 participants), were included in the narrative synthesis, and 26 studies (n=4546 participants) in the meta-analysis. 20 studies used SMS as the primary mode of delivery of the digital health intervention, 25 used smartphone applications, and 11 implemented interventions via websites. Smartphone application interventions reported higher reach compared with SMS and website-based interventions, but website-based interventions reported higher uptake compared with SMS and smartphone application interventions. Effective interventions, in general, included people with greater severity of their condition at baseline (ie, higher HbA(1c)) and administration of a higher dose intensity of the intervention, such as more frequent use of smartphone applications. Overall, digital health intervention group participants had a -0·30 (95% CI -0·42 to -0·19) percentage point greater reduction in HbA(1c), compared with control group participants. The difference in HbA(1c) reduction between groups was statistically significant when interventions were delivered through smartphone applications (-0·42% [-0·63 to -0·20]) and via SMS (-0·37% [-0·57 to -0·17]), but not when delivered via websites (-0·09% [-0·64 to 0·46]). Due to the considerable heterogeneity between included studies, the level of evidence was moderate overall. INTERPRETATION: Smartphone application and SMS interventions, but not website-based interventions, were associated with better glycaemic control. However, the studies' heterogeneity should be recognised. Considering that both smartphone application and SMS interventions are effective for diabetes management, clinicians should consider factors such as reach, uptake, patient preference, and context of the intervention when deciding on the mode of delivery of the intervention. Nine in ten people worldwide own a feature phone and can receive SMS and four in five people have access to a smartphone, with numerous smartphone applications being available for diabetes management. Clinicians should familiarise themselves with this modality of programme delivery and encourage people with type 2 diabetes to use evidence-based applications for improving their self-management of diabetes. Future research needs to describe in detail the mediators and moderators of the effectiveness and implementation of SMS and smartphone application interventions, such as the optimal dose, frequency, timing, user interface, and communication mode to both further improve their effectiveness and to increase their reach, uptake, and feasibility.

"Effectiveness and Safety of Bu Shen Kai Qiao Fang in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: Study Protocol for a Multicenter, Prospective, Real-World Clinical Trial.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common degenerative disease of the nervous system with serious impact on quality of life of patients and their families. With an aging population, AD has become a major public health problem in China and worldwide. However, the physiological and pathological mechanisms of AD have not been fully elucidated, and there is a lack of effective prevention and clinical treatment methods. Many studies have found that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a good therapeutic effect on cognitive function in AD patients. Bu Shen Kai Qiao Fang (BSKQF) is one such Chinese herbal preparation used in the treatment of AD. We designed a protocol for a real-world clinical study of BSKQF combined with Donepezil hydrochloride (DH) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this approach in the treatment of AD patients. METHODS: This is a protocol for a real-world, multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study. The study will recruit 860 AD patients from four hospitals across China. Equal numbers of patients will be treated with BSKQF and DH or with DH only. The criteria for grouping are based primarily on patient preference. Outcome measures include scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MOCA) and will be recorded at baseline, and at one, two and three months after enrollment. The plasma Aβ42 and plasma Tau levels of participating patients will also be measured by ELISA at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. Safety metrics and adverse events (AEs) of participating patients will be monitored and recorded. DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of BSKQF in the treatment of AD. The results will provide reliable evidence for the clinical application of BSKQF in the treatment of AD. STUDY REGISTRATION: Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, NO.

Personalizing prevention: Advances in pharmacotherapy for HIV prevention.,"The HIV epidemic continues to pose a significant burden on the healthcare system. Although the incidence of annual new infections is decreasing, health disparities persist and most new infections remain concentrated into different racial, ethnic, and minority groups. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which involves those at high risk of acquiring HIV to take chronic medications to prevent acquisition of the virus, is key to preventing new HIV infections. The purpose of this article is to review medication therapies for PrEP and examine their role in personalizing PrEP in different patient populations. Additionally, new medications currently under development for PrEP are reviewed, as well as treatment as prevention (TasP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). There are currently four medications available for PrEP: the oral options of co-formulated emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) or emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF); injectable long-acting cabotegravir (CAB-LA); and the vaginal ring dapivirine (DPV-VR). FTC/TAF is not currently indicated for persons at risk for HIV through vaginal sex due to lack of studies, but trials are currently ongoing. DPV-VR is available in Zimbabwe and South Africa and has been endorsed by the World Health Organization but is not currently available in the United States. Several agents are also in development for use in PrEP: the novel long-acting injectable lenacapavir, a first-in-class capsid inhibitor, which has no cross-resistance to any existing HIV drug class; the subdermal implant islatravir, a first-in-class translocation inhibitor; and VRC01, a broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) which has been evaluated in proof-of-concept studies that may lead to the development of more potent bnAbs. Overall, PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV infection in high-risk populations. Identifying optimal PrEP regimens in different patient populations is complex and must consider patient-specific factors and medication cost and access considerations. Lastly, providers should consider individual patient preferences with regard to prevention to improve access, retention in care, and adherence.",0
Mechanical Thrombectomy for Acute and Subacute Blocked Arteries and Veins in the Lower Limbs: A Health Technology Assessment.,"BACKGROUND: A blockage to the blood vessels in the lower extremities may cause pain and discomfort. If left unmanaged, it may lead to amputation or chronic disability, such as in the form of post-thrombotic syndrome. We conducted a health technology assessment of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) devices, which are proposed to remove a blood clot, which may form in the arteries or veins of the lower legs. This evaluation considered blockages in the veins and arteries separately, and included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding MT for lower limb blockages, patient preferences and values, and clinical and health system stakeholders' perspectives. METHOD: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Cochrane tool for randomized controlled trials or the risk of bias among non-randomized studies (RoBANS) tool for nonrandomized studies, and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature search. We did not conduct a primary economic evaluation since the clinical evidence is highly uncertain. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding MT treatment for inpatients with arterial acute limb ischemia and acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower limb in Ontario. To contextualize the potential value of MT, we spoke with people with acute DVT. To understand the barriers and facilitators of accessing MT, we surveyed clinical and health system stakeholders to gain their perspectives. RESULTS: We included 40 studies (3 randomized controlled trials and 37 observational studies) in the clinical evidence review. For patients who experience arterial acute limb ischemia, compared with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) alone, MT has greater technical success and patency and reduced hospital length of stay, but the evidence for these outcomes is uncertain (GRADE: Very low). Mechanical thrombectomy may reduce the volume of thrombolytic medication required and CDT infusion time (a determinant for intensive care unit [ICU] need) in patients experiencing acute DVT, but it is uncertain if this is to a meaningful degree (GRADE: Moderate to Very low). It may also reduce the proportion of people who experience post-thrombotic syndrome and overall hospital length of stay, but it is uncertain (GRADE: Very low).We estimated that publicly funding MT for people with arterial acute limb ischemia in Ontario would lead to an annual cost savings of $0.17 million in year 1 to $0.14 million in year 5, for a total savings of $0.83 million over 5 years. This cost savings was mainly attributed to reduced ICU stays among people who received MT, but the results had considerable uncertainty. For the population with acute DVT, publicly funding MT would lead to an additional cost of $0.77 million in year 1 to $1.44 million in year 5, for a total additional cost of $5.5 million over 5 years.The people with acute DVT with whom we spoke reported that MT was generally seen as a positive option, and those who had undergone the procedure reported positively on its value as a treatment to quickly remove a clot. Accessing treatment for DVT could be a barrier, especially in more remote areas of Ontario.Clinicians using the technology advised that facilitators to accessing the technology included perceived improvements in patient outcomes, resourcing requirements, addressing unmet needs, and avoidance of ICU stay. The main barrier identified was cost. Clinicians who were not using the technology advised that barriers were low case-use volume, along with costs for the equipment and for health human resources. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy may have greater technical success and patency and reduce hospital length of stay for patients experiencing an arterial acute limb ischemia and, for patients with an acute DVT, it may reduce CDT volume and infusion time, the proportion of people who experience post-thrombotic syndrome, and hospital length of stay. Mechanical thrombectomy may reduce the associated ICU costs, but it has higher equipment costs compared with usual care. Publicly funding MT in Ontario for populations with arterial acute limb ischemia may not lead to a substantial budget increase to the province. Publicly funding MT for acute DVT would lead to an additional cost of $5.5 million over 5 years. For people with acute DVT, MT was seen as a potential positive treatment option to remove the clot quickly. Overall, the majority of clinical stakeholders we engaged with (including both those with and without experience with MT) were supportive of the use of the technology.",0
[Geographical access to hemodialysis: an analysis of patient choices].,"INTRODUCTION: Patients do not always go to the facility closest to their home. DESCRIPTION: A study was carried out in Provence-Alpes Côtes d'Azur (PACA) on patients' preferences to mobilize the hemodialysis offer. METHODS: The data were extracted from the REIN Registry. Potential access was compared with actual access. A survey was carried out among a sample of patients travelling an additional distance of more than 25 km. RESULTS: About a quarter of the patients did not travel to the nearest facility. Of these, 16.3% travelled an additional distance of over 25 km. Patients' choices were determined by the relationship of trust with the team that first set up dialysis, followed by their desire to be followed in a multi-purpose facility. DISCUSSION: While distance remained the decisive factor, human factors were cited in the majority of cases to explain the bypass. CONCLUSION: The links between the first team and the next one should be strengthened.",0
Predictors of Informed People's Preferences for Statin Therapy to Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Risk: an Internet Survey Study.,"BACKGROUND: Guidelines suggest clinicians inform patients about their 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; however, little is known about how the risk estimate influences patients' preferences for statin therapy for primary prevention. OBJECTIVE: To define predictors of preference for statin therapy after participants were informed about their individualized benefits and harms. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey in 2020. SETTING: Online US survey panel. PARTICIPANTS: A national sample of 304 respondents aged 40 to 75 who had not previously taken a statin and who knew their cholesterol levels and blood pressure measurements. INTERVENTION: Participants entered their risk factors into a calculator which estimated their 10-year CVD risk. They were then provided with an estimate of their absolute risk reduction with a statin and the chance of side effects from meta-analyses. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: We used a hierarchical model to predict participants' preferences for statin therapy according to their 10-year CVD risk, perceptions of the magnitude of statin benefit (large, medium, small, or almost no benefit), worry about side effects (very worried, somewhat worried, a little worried, not worried at all), and other variables. KEY RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 55 years (SD = 9.9); 50% were female, 44% were non-white, and 16% had a high school degree or less education. After reviewing their benefits and side effects, 45% of the participants reported they probably or definitely wanted to take a statin. In the full hierarchical model, only perceived benefits of taking a statin was a significant independent predictor of wanting a statin (OR 7.3, 95% CI 4.7, 12.2). LIMITATIONS: Participants were from an internet survey panel and making hypothetical decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Participants' perceptions of their benefit from statin therapy predicted wanting to take a statin for primary prevention; neither estimated CVD risk nor worries about statin side effects were independent predictors.",0
Current Health State Affected Patient Preferences More Than Disease Status: A Discrete Choice Experiment in Multiple Myeloma.,"OBJECTIVES: To examine how disease status and current health state influence treatment preferences of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). METHODS: Participants with MM from France, Germany, and the United Kingdom completed a web-based survey that included a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and EQ-5D assessment. The DCE elicited preferences for 8 attributes: increased life expectancy, increased time to relapse, pain, fatigue, risk of infection, administration (route and duration), frequency of administration, and monitoring. Multinomial logit models were used to analyze DCE preference data and to calculate life expectancy trade-offs. RESULTS: Three hundred participants with MM (newly diagnosed, transplant eligible, n = 108; newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible, n = 105; relapsed-refractory, n = 87) completed the survey. The most valued attributes were pain, fatigue, and increased life expectancy. Participants would want an additional 2.7 years of life expectancy (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4-3.1 years) to tolerate extreme pain and an additional 2.0 years of life expectancy (95% CI 1.6-2.3 years) to tolerate constant fatigue. Participants in a better health state (third EQ-5D score quartile [0.897]) required less additional life expectancy than participants with a worse health state (first EQ-5D score quartile [0.662]) to tolerate extreme pain (2.3 years [95% CI 1.9-2.6 years] vs 3.0 years [95% CI 2.6-3.4 years]; P = .007). There was little difference in treatment preferences between newly diagnosed and relapsed-refractory patients for pain, fatigue, and increased life expectancy. CONCLUSIONS: Current health state influenced treatment preferences of patients with MM more than disease status and should be considered when making treatment decisions.",1
Orthodontic Aligners: Current Perspectives for the Modern Orthodontic Office.,"Orthodontic aligners are changing the practice of orthodontics. This system of orthodontic appliances is becoming the mainstay appliance of choice for orthodontic offices in many countries. Patient preferences and lifestyle needs have made this appliance the primary choice when seeking care. In the early days, appliances lacked the efficiency and effectiveness of traditional bracket-wire systems, but modern systems are now able to handle a more comprehensive orthodontic caseload. Current systems provide newer biomechanical strategies and artificial intelligence-driven tooth movements for better outcomes. These improvements now mean that an orthodontist can be better prepared to manage a larger number of orthodontic malocclusions. This paper aims to discuss some of the evolution of orthodontic aligners and to describe to orthodontists the fundamentals of aligner therapy. In addition, it will provide an evidence-based outcome to the existing treatment outcomes in the current literature.",0
Persistent obstructive sleep apnoea in children: treatment options and management considerations.,"Unresolved obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) after an adenotonsillectomy, henceforth referred to as persistent OSA, is increasingly recognised in children (2-18 years). Although associated with obesity, underlying medical complexity, and craniofacial disorders, persistent OSA also occurs in otherwise healthy children. Inadequate treatment of persistent OSA can lead to long-term adverse health outcomes beyond childhood. Positive airway pressure, used as a one-size-fits-all primary management strategy for persistent childhood OSA, is highly efficacious but has unacceptably low adherence rates. A pressing need exists for a broader, more effective management approach for persistent OSA in children. In this Personal View, we discuss the use and the need for evaluation of current and novel therapeutics, the role of shared decision-making models that consider patient preferences, and the importance of considering the social determinants of health in research and clinical practice. A multipronged, comprehensive approach to persistent OSA might achieve better clinical outcomes in childhood and promote health equity for all children.",0
Patient perspectives on risk-reducing salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy for ovarian cancer risk-reduction: A systematic review of the literature.,"OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence suggests the fallopian tube as the site of origin of BRCA1/2-associated high-grade ovarian cancers. Several ongoing trials are evaluating salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy (RRSDO) for ovarian cancer risk reduction and patients are beginning to ask their clinicians about this surgical option. This study sought to systematically review the available literature examining patient preferences regarding RRSDO and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) to provide clinicians with an understanding of patient values, concerns, and priorities surrounding ovarian cancer risk-reducing surgery. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PROSPERO No.: CRD42023400690). We searched key electronic databases to identify studies evaluating acceptance and surgical decision-making regarding RRSO and RRSDO among patients with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. RESULTS: The search yielded 239 results, among which six publications met the systematic review inclusion criteria. Acceptance of RRSDO was evaluated in all studies and ranged from 34% to 71%. Factors positively impacting patients' acceptance of RRSDO included: avoidance of surgical menopause, preservation of fertility, concerns about sexual dysfunction, family history of breast cancer, and avoidance of hormone replacement therapy. Factors limiting this acceptance reported by patients included concerns regarding oncologic safety, surgical timing, and surgical complications. CONCLUSION: To date, few studies have explored patient perspectives surrounding RRSDO. Collectively, the limited data available indicate a high level of acceptance among BRCA1/2 carriers, and provides insight regarding both facilitating and limiting factors associated with patient preferences to better equip clinicians in the counseling and support of their patients.",1
Patient preferences for telehealth services in a large multispecialty practice.,"INTRODUCTION: Telehealth service provision has accelerated during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As the pandemic continues, clinical practices have discovered ways to resume operations. Opportunities exist to understand patient preferences for telehealth clinical services and to tailor offerings to different demographic groups. METHODS: We conducted a survey of patients receiving telehealth services through our outpatient practice to understand the types of healthcare services for which patients report preferences for telehealth. RESULTS: We received 551 survey responses (response rate = 20.8%; 551/2650). More than half of patients indicated being 'very likely' to use telehealth services to refill medication(s) (67.3%), prepare for an upcoming visit (66.1%), review test results (60.3%), or receive education (54.2%). Males had lower odds of preferring telehealth services for reviewing test results (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34-0.94) or mental health issues (OR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.38-0.77). Respondents who received a video visit were significantly more likely than those who received a telephone visit to report preferences for using telehealth for education, care plan discussions, long-term health issues, and mental health. DISCUSSION: Patient preferences for telehealth services vary by services provided and respondent demographics. Experience with telehealth increases the likelihood for future use of these services.",0
Jargon Be Gone - Patient Preference in Doctor Communication.,"While it has been shown that healthcare providers often use medical jargon, less is known about how patients prefer their clinicians communicate. This mixed-methods study aimed to better understand the general public's preference in healthcare communication. A volunteer cohort of 205 adult attendees at the 2021 Minnesota State Fair was presented a survey with two scenarios at a doctor's office sharing the same information: one using medical terminology and one using simpler, jargon-free language. Survey participants were asked which doctor they preferred, to describe each doctor, and to explain why they believe that doctors may use medical terminology. Common descriptive themes for the jargon-using doctor included that this doctor caused confusion, was too technical, and was uncaring, while the doctor who spoke without jargon was perceived as a good communicator, caring/empathetic, and approachable. Respondents perceived a range of reasons why doctors use jargon, from not recognizing they are using words that are not understood to trying to make themselves feel more important. Overall, 91% of survey respondents preferred the doctor who communicated without medical jargon.",0
Managing the challenge of a small aortic annulus in patients with severe aortic stenosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Small aortic annulus (SAA) poses a challenge in the management of patients with severe aortic stenosis requiring aortic valve replacement - both surgical and transcatheter - since it has been associated with worse clinical outcomes. AREAS COVERED: This review aims to comprehensively summarize the available evidence regarding the management of aortic stenosis in patients with SAA and discuss the current controversies as well as future perspectives in this field. EXPERT OPINION: It is paramount to agree in a common definition for diagnosing and properly treating SAA patients, and for that purpose, multidetector computer tomography is essential. The results of recent trials led to the expansion of transcatheter aortic valve replacement among patients of all the surgical-risk spectrum, and the choice of treatment (transcatheter, surgical) should be based on patient comorbidities, anatomical characteristics, and patient preferences.",0
Subcutaneous immunoglobulin for patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: a real-world single centre experience.,"OBJECTIVES: Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are heterogeneous diseases characterized by skeletal muscle inflammation associated with cutaneous, pulmonary, and/or other visceral organ involvement. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been recommended as an adjunct therapy for IIM patients refractory to conventional therapy. However, IVIG has high resource needs and increased risk of adverse reactions. Subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) therapy has been used as an alternative to IVIG in primary immunodeficiencies and neuroinflammatory disorders. We assessed the satisfaction, patient preference and effectiveness in IIM patients transitioned from IVIG to SCIG. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive 20 patients with IIM who were transitioned from IVIG to SCIG therapy for >12 months. Patient preference between IVIG vs SCIG was surveyed using a questionnaire previously used in studies with neuroinflammatory conditions. In addition, disease flares, changes in immunosuppression, cumulative prednisone doses and global disease activity were evaluated using the Myositis Intention to Treat Index (MITAX) 12-months prior to- and post-SCIG initiation. RESULTS: Most patients (78.9%) preferred SCIG over IVIG and preferred home-based therapies to hospital-based therapies. There was no significant difference in global disease activity (MITAX 3.31 vs 3.02) nor in cumulative steroid doses 12-months prior to- or post-SCIG initiation. Three patients experienced disease flares, 5 escalated in immunosuppression, while 4 patients deescalated in immunosuppressive medications. CONCLUSIONS: SCIG is preferred by most patients over IVIG without a substantial increased disease activity or need for additional corticosteroids. Future cost effectiveness studies may provide an additional rationale for utilizing SCIG over IVIG for maintenance therapy for IIM.",0
Implementation of a Standardized Shared Decision-making Bundle to Improve Communication Practices in the Neurocritical Care Unit.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Shared decision-making (SDM) aligns patient preferences with health care team treatment goals. This quality improvement initiative implemented a standardized SDM bundle within a neurocritical care unit (NCCU), where unique demands make existing, provider-driven SDM practices challenging. METHODS: An interprofessional team defined key issues, identified barriers, and created change ideas to drive implementation of an SDM bundle using the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Model for Improvement framework incorporating Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. The SDM bundle included (1) a health care team huddle pre-SDM and post-SDM conversation; (2) a social worker-driven SDM conversation with the patient family, including core standardized communication elements to ensure consistency and quality; and (3) an SDM documentation tool within the electronic medical record to ensure the SDM conversation was accessible to all health care team members. The primary outcome measure was percentage of SDM conversations documented. RESULTS: Documentation of SDM conversations improved by 56%, from 27% to 83% pre/postintervention. Average time to documentation decreased by 4 days, from day 9 preintervention to day 5 postintervention. There was no significant change in NCCU length of stay, nor did palliative care consultation rates increase. Postintervention, SDM team huddle compliance was 94.3%. DISCUSSION: A team-driven, standardized SDM bundle that integrates with health care team workflows enabled SDM conversations to occur earlier and resulted in improved documentation of SDM conversations. Team-driven SDM bundles have the potential to improve communication and promote early alignment with patient family goals, preferences, and values.",0
Patient preferences and comfort for cancer survivorship models of care: results of an online survey.,"PURPOSE: Workforce shortages will impact oncologists' ability to provide both active and survivorship care. While primary care provider (PCP) or survivorship clinic transition has been emphasized, there is little evidence regarding patient comfort. METHODS: We developed an online survey in partnership with patient advocates to assess survivors' comfort with PCP or survivorship clinic care and distributed the survey to online, cancer-specific patient communities from June to August 2020. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 975 surveys were complete. Most respondents were women (91%) and had private insurance (65%). Thirty-six cancer types were reported. Ninety-three percent had a PCP. Twenty-four percent were comfortable seeing a PCP for survivorship care. Higher odds of comfort were seen among respondents who were Black or had stage 0 cancer; female sex was associated with lower odds. Fifty-five percent were comfortable with a survivorship clinic. Higher odds of comfort were seen with lymphoma or ovarian cancer, > 15 years from diagnosis, and non-US government insurance. Lower odds were seen with melanoma, advanced stage, Medicaid insurance, and one late effect. Preference for PCP care was 87% for general health, 32% for recurrence monitoring, and 37% for late effect management. CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of cancer survivors were comfortable with PCP-led survivorship care and about half with a survivorship clinic. Most preferred oncologist care for recurrence monitoring and late-effect management. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Patient preference and comfort should be considered when developing survivorship care models. Future efforts should focus on facilitating patient-centered transitions to non-oncologist care.",0
Dietary Management of Eosinophilic Esophagitis.,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune-mediated food antigen-driven disease characterized by tissue eosinophilia and clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction. Medical and dietary therapies can be offered as treatment options in both pediatric and adult populations. Advances in nutritional research in EoE have produced different levels of dietary restriction, ranging from elimination of a single food group to more extensive restriction such as the two-food elimination diet, four-food elimination diet, or six-food elimination diet. Efficacy and outcomes vary for each level of restriction. The option of using dietary therapy allows clinicians to partner with patients in shared decision-making to balance the right level of food antigen restriction for the desired outcome. Key considerations when choosing dietary therapy hinge on patient preference and resources, food-related quality of life, and the ability to provide nutritional diversity and maintain nutritional parameters. This article highlights these considerations and offers clinical pearls to guide clinicians who wish to incorporate dietary therapy of EoE into their practice.",0
Cervical preparation for second-trimester procedural abortion.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the evidence-informed options for cervical preparation prior to second-trimester dilation and evacuation (D&E). RECENT FINDINGS: As abortion restrictions increase and the number of abortion clinics and providers decreases, pregnant people are facing more barriers to abortion access. Those in need are now often required to travel for second-trimester abortion care, only to be faced with additional restrictions, such as mandatory waiting periods. Cervical preparation is recommended prior to D&E and takes time for effect. Given the increasing time required to obtain an abortion, patients and providers may prefer same-day cervical preparation to decrease the total time required. Options for same-day cervical preparation include misoprostol alone with single or serial doses, and misoprostol combined with osmotic dilators or transcervical balloon (Foley catheter). Same-day preparation may require additional clinical space to accommodate people after initiation of cervical preparation to manage side-effects and timing of the abortion. Overnight options are also used and more frequently later in the second trimester. Overnight options include mifepristone, osmotic dilators, and transcervical balloon and are often combined with same-day misoprostol. Medication alone preparation is well tolerated and effective in the second trimester, with the addition of mechanical methods with advancing gestation. With many options and combinations being safe and effective, providers can be dynamic and alter approach with supply shortages, adjust to different clinical settings, consider patient medical and surgical factors, and accommodate provider and patient preferences. SUMMARY: Multiple pharmacologic and mechanical options have been shown to be safe and effective for cervical preparation prior to D&E. Consideration for multiple factors should influence the method of cervical preparation and methods may vary by patient, provider and setting.",0
"Exploring herbal remedy utilization for wound healing: Patterns, patient preferences, and implications for nursing practice.","PURPOSE: The utilization of herbal remedies for wound healing is a notable aspect of traditional medicine practices. Understanding herbal use among patients yields insights for nursing care enhancement. This study aimed to investigate the utilization of herbal remedies for wound healing among diabetic patients. METHODS: A total of 453 participants were enrolled, with demographic data, including age, sex, occupation, education level, residence, ethnic group, distance from health service, herbal use duration, and wound duration presented. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data, including means, standard deviations, ranges, and percentages. FINDINGS: The average participant age was 55.39 years, with most being non-civil servant workers (60.3%) and having a low education level (67.1%). Indian almond wood (9.7%) and green betel (6.8%) were the most commonly used herbs for wound healing. Family members were the primary source of information (29.1%), and 43.7% obtained herbs from personal gardens. Although 94.2% of participants did not disclose herbal use to health liaisons, 53.4% used herbs specifically for wound healing. Users reported both positive and negative effects on wounds from various herbs, indicating variability in experiences. However, the consistency of herb usage by individual patients was uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified diverse herbal remedies used for wound healing among patients, driven by familial recommendations. Usage pattern diversity and effects signal necessity for researching herb safety and efficacy. Clarifying the impact of consistent herb usage on wound healing is essential for understanding patients' preferences and practices. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: These findings emphasize the importance of open communication between patients and healthcare providers regarding herbal remedy use. Nurses should acknowledge patients' preferences for traditional healing practices while ensuring they receive evidence-based care. Patient-centered herbal strategies enhance nursing practice, fostering holistic wound care. Further research can guide nursing interventions, facilitate informed decision-making, and improve patient outcomes.",0
"Duration of Follow-up and Timing of Discharge from Imaging Follow-up, in Adult Patients with Urolithiasis After Surgical or Medical Intervention: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis from the European Association of Urology Guideline Panel on Urolithiasi","CONTEXT: No algorithm exists for structured follow-up of urolithiasis patients. OBJECTIVE: To provide a discharge time point during follow-up of urolithiasis patients after treatment. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic review of PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, and reference lists according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. Fifty studies were eligible. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: From a pooled analysis of 5467 stone-free patients, we estimated that for a safety margin of 80% for remaining stone free, patients should be followed up using imaging, for at least 2 yr (radiopaque stones) or 3 yr (radiolucent stones) before being discharged. Patients should be discharged after 5 yr of no recurrence with a safety margin of 90%. Regarding residual disease, patients with fragments ≤4 mm could be offered surveillance up to 4 yr since intervention rates range between 17% and 29%, disease progression between 9% and 34%, and spontaneous passage between 21% and 34% at 49 mo. Patients with larger residual fragments should be offered further definitive intervention since intervention rates are high (24-100%). Insufficient data exist for high-risk patients, but the current literature dictates that patients who are adherent to targeted medical treatment seem to experience less stone growth or regrowth of residual fragments, and may be discharged after 36-48 mo of nonprogressive disease on imaging. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that stone-free patients with radiopaque or radiolucent stones should be followed up to 2 or 3 yr, respectively. In patients with residual fragments ≤4 mm, surveillance or intervention can be advised according to patient preferences and characteristics, while for those with larger residual fragments, reintervention should be scheduled. PATIENT SUMMARY: Here, we review the literature regarding follow-up of urolithiasis patients. Patients who have no stones after treatment should be seen up to 2-3 yr, those with large fragments should be reoperated, and those with small fragments could be offered surveillance with imaging.",0
Patient Preferences Regarding Surgical Treatment Methods for Symptomatic Uterine Fibroids.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to rank the factors that are most and least important to patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids when considering surgical treatment options. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a best worst scaling (BWS) preference elicitation approach, participants completed an online survey to rank factors associated with fibroid surgical treatments. Survey content was based on a literature review and included the following factors: symptom relief; surgical complications; repeat treatment; recovery time; cosmetic effects; risk of spreading undiagnosed cancer; sexual outcomes; maintenance of child-bearing; continuation of menses; unpredictable menses; and location of procedure. Participants completed 11 BWS tasks. For each task, we presented participants with a subset of 5 factors from the possible 11, and participants chose the most important and least important factor. Participants' responses were analyzed using conditional logistic regression to determine the relative importance of factors. Patient priorities were further explored via age and race. RESULTS: 285 respondents with symptomatic uterine fibroids (69 physician-confirmed and 216 self-reported) who had not undergone prior surgical treatment completed the survey. Respondents were enrolled from two clinical sites (clinical site cohort) and an online consumer panel (panel cohort). Both cohorts identified symptom relief, cancer risk, repeat treatment and complications as the most important factors in selecting surgical treatment options and location of procedure, return to normal activities after surgery, and cosmetic effects like presence of a scar after the surgical treatment as the least important factors. Of note, younger women (≤ 40) placed greater importance on the ability to have children after the procedure. CONCLUSION: Information regarding the factors most and least important to patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids might inform development and regulatory evaluation of new technologies and procedures. Study results may be useful in efforts to develop a set of outcomes to include in future fibroids clinical studies.",1
Preoperative Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging: An Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario) Clinical Practice Guideline.,"BACKGROUND: The use of preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after the diagnosis of breast cancer by mammography and/or ultrasound is inconsistent. METHODS: After conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing preoperative breast MRI versus no MRI, we reconvened to prepare a clinical practice guideline on this topic. RESULTS: Based on the evidence that MRI improved recurrence, decreased the rates of reoperations (re-excisions or conversion mastectomy), and increased detection of synchronous contralateral breast cancer, we recommend that preoperative breast MRI should be considered on a case-by-case basis in patients diagnosed with breast cancer for whom additional information about disease extent could influence treatment. Based on stronger evidence, preoperative breast MRI is recommended in patients diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma for whom additional information about disease extent could influence treatment. For both recommendations, the decision to proceed with MRI would be conditional on shared decision-making between care providers and the patient, taking into account the benefits and risks of MRI as well as patient preferences. Based on the opinion of the Working Group, preoperative breast MRI is also recommended in the following more specific situations: (a) to aid in surgical planning of breast conserving surgery in patients with suspected or known multicentric or multifocal disease; (b) to identify additional lesions in patients with dense breasts; (c) to determine the presence of pectoralis major muscle/chest wall invasion in patients with posteriorly located tumours or when invasion of the pectoralis major muscle or chest wall is suspected; (d) to aid in surgical planning for skin/nipple-sparing mastectomies, autologous reconstruction, oncoplastic surgery, and breast conserving surgery with suspected nipple/areolar involvement; and (e) in patients with familial/hereditary breast cancer but who have not had recent breast MRI as part of screening or diagnosis.",0
"A Randomized, Prospective, Observer-Masked Study Comparing Dropless Treatment Regimen Using Intracanalicular Dexamethasone Insert, Intracameral Ketorolac, and Intracameral Moxifloxacin versus Conventional Topical Therapy to Control Postoperative Pain and ","PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical efficacy and patient preference for a dropless treatment regimen compared to conventional topical therapy in patients undergoing cataract surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective, contralateral eye study, patients with bilateral cataract were randomized to receive either intracanalicular dexamethasone insert, intracameral phenylephrine 1%/ketorolac 0.3%, and intracameral moxifloxacin (50 µg) (study group) or topical moxifloxacin 0.5%, ketorolac 0.5%, and prednisolone acetate 1.0% QID (control group). The second eye underwent cataract surgery 2 weeks later and was treated with the opposite treatment. All patients were evaluated at Days 1, 7, 14, 28, and 3 months. The primary outcome measure was postoperative ocular pain. Secondary outcomes included summed ocular inflammation score (SOIS; the sum of the mean anterior chamber cells and anterior flare score), the patient preference for medication protocol between the two eyes, and patient out-of-pocket cost of medications. Safety outcome measures included CDVA, intraocular pressure, central retinal thickness (CRT), and the incidence of reported AEs. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with no pain was similar in both groups at all postoperative visits (p>0.05). No statistically significant difference in SOIS score was observed between the two groups at any visit. A strong majority of the patients (94.7%) preferred the study eye's dropless regimen over the control eye's conventional topical therapy regimen. No statistically significant difference in mean intraocular pressure (IOP) was observed at any postoperative visit, except at Week 1. The mean CDVA was also similar in both groups at all postoperative visits (p>0.05). The postoperative mean CRT was comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION: A dropless treatment regimen is as effective as topical eyedrop administration. A higher proportion of patients who underwent bilateral cataract surgery preferred the dropless treatment regimen over the patient-administered eye drop regimen.",0
Designing Clinical MRI for Enhanced Workflow and Value.,"MRI is an expensive and traditionally time-intensive modality in imaging. With the paradigm shift toward value-based healthcare, radiology departments must examine the entire MRI process cycle to identify opportunities to optimize efficiency and enhance value for patients. Digital tools such as ""frictionless scheduling"" prioritize patient preference and convenience, thereby delivering patient-centered care. Recent advances in conventional and deep learning-based accelerated image reconstruction methods have reduced image acquisition time to such a degree that so-called nongradient time now constitutes a major percentage of total room time. For this reason, architectural design strategies that reconfigure patient preparation processes and decrease the turnaround time between scans can substantially impact overall throughput while also improving patient comfort and privacy. Real-time informatics tools that provide an enterprise-wide overview of MRI workflow and Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS)-integrated instant messaging can complement these efforts by offering transparent, situational data and facilitating communication between radiology team members. Finally, long-term investment in training, recruiting, and retaining a highly skilled technologist workforce is essential for building a pipeline and team of technologists committed to excellence. Here, we highlight various opportunities for optimizing MRI workflow and enhancing value by offering many of our own on-the-ground experiences and conclude by anticipating some of the future directions for process improvement and innovation in clinical MR imaging.

Patient Portal Privacy: Perspectives of Adolescents and Emerging Adults Living with HIV and the Parental/Guardian Role in Supporting Their Care.,"BACKGROUND: Increasing the percentage of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), including youth, who are virally suppressed to 95% is an overall goal of the ending the HIV epidemic initiative. While patient portals have become ubiquitous, questions remain about how best to operationalize parental/guardian access to youth's patient portals in alignment with optimizing HIV care outcomes and patient preferences. This qualitative study focuses on understanding perspectives among youth with HIV (YHIV) about parental access to patient portals. METHODS: Eligible participants were YHIV aged 13 to 25 years receiving care at an urban academic hospital. Semistructured individual/paired interviews were conducted between May 2022 and March 2023. Participants were asked to discuss thoughts on parental access to patient portals, and roles parents/guardians have in supporting their HIV care. Semistructured interviews were conducted with adolescent and emerging adult health care workers (HCWs) to gain perspectives on YHIV emergent themes. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim, and we conducted thematic analysis using an inductive approach to identify codes and themes. RESULTS: Sixteen YHIV and four HCWs participated in interviews. Parental roles in coordinating HIV care ranged from supporting YHIV needs for transportation, acquiring, and taking medications, to not having any role at all. Participants shared heterogeneous perspectives about their openness to share patient portal access with their parents/guardians. Perspectives were not strictly congruent along lines of participant age or parental roles in helping youth to manage HIV care. Sharing passwords emerged both as a pathway that YHIV grant access to their accounts and a source of confusion for clinicians when parents/guardians send messages using their child's account. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest HCWs should initiate conversations with YHIV patients to determine preferences for parental/guardian access to their patient portal, educate on proxy access, and explain the extent of medical information that is shared with proxy accounts, regardless of age and perceived parental involvement in HIV care.",0
Determining patient preferences in the treatment of medication-refractory overactive bladder.,"INTRODUCTION: Overactive bladder (OAB) is often suboptimally addressed by behavioral or pharmacological treatments. Less than 15% of patients choose to pursue advanced OAB therapy (sacral nerve stimulation [SNS], percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation [PTNS], and bladder onabotulinum toxin type-A [BTX-A]). We seek to better understand which factors are most important to patients when choosing a third-line therapy. METHODS/MATERIALS: We developed a conjoint analysis survey that included five attributes of the third-line options for OAB (SNS, PTNS, and BTX-A). We administered the survey to new patients with urinary incontinence at two institutions. A hierarchical Bayes random effects regression analysis was used to determine the relative importance of the attributes. A choice simulator was used to model which third-line treatment options patients preferred. We followed patients to see if they pursued their predicted treatment. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients completed the study of whom 89% were women. There was representation from all age groups. The most important attributes of decision-making were the frequency of future procedures, the risk of catheterization, and the need for a device. On market simulation, SNS was the preferred treatment option (47%), followed by PTNS (29%) and BTX-A (14%). Only 10% of patients did not find any treatment option acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent follow-up, risk of catheterization, and the need for a device were the most important attributes when making a decision on third-line OAB therapy. On market simulation, SNS is the preferred treatment for all age groups though the ultimate choice in third-line therapy may be affected by external factors.",1
Preferences for COVID-19 Vaccination in People With Chronic Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases.,"OBJECTIVE: To understand how people with chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) trade off the benefits and risks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine options. METHODS: We conducted an online discrete-choice experiment in people with IMIDs to quantify the relative importance (RI) of attributes relevant to COVID-19 vaccination. Participants were recruited between May and August 2021 through patient groups and clinics in Canada, and completed 10 choices where they selected 1 of 2 hypothetical vaccine options or no vaccine. The RI of each attribute was estimated and heterogeneity was explored through latent class analysis. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 551 people (89% female, mean age 46 yrs) with a range of IMIDs (inflammatory bowel disease [48%], rheumatoid arthritis [38%], systemic lupus erythematosus [16%]). Most had received 1 (94%) or 2 (64%) COVID-19 vaccinations. Across the ranges of levels considered, vaccine effectiveness was most important (RI = 66%), followed by disease flare (21%), rare but serious risks (9%), and number/timing of injections (4%). Patients would accept a risk of disease flare requiring a treatment change of ≤ 8.8% for a vaccine with a small absolute increase in effectiveness (10%). Of the 3 latent classes, the group with the greatest aversion to disease flare were more likely to be male and have lower incomes, but this group still valued effectiveness higher than other attributes. CONCLUSION: Patients perceived the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination to outweigh rare serious risks and disease flare. This supports COVID-19 vaccine strategies that maximize effectiveness, while recognizing the heterogeneity in preferences that exists.",1
Quantifying preferences for urea cycle disorder treatments using a discrete choice experiment.,"AIMS: Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) can cause ammonia accumulation and central nervous system toxicity. Nitrogen-binding medications can be efficacious, but certain attributes may negatively impact adherence. This study sought to quantify the administration-related attributes influencing overall prescription selection and patient adherence. METHODS: A web-based, quantitative survey including discrete choice experiment (DCE) methodology captured responses from health care providers for patients with UCDs. A series of hypothetical treatment profile sets with attributes such as route of administration, taste/odor, preparation instructions, packaging, dose measurement, and weight use restrictions were presented. From 16 sets of 3 hypothetical product profiles, respondents evaluated attributes most preferred for prescription selection or patient adherence. Attributes assumed a higher overall preference if relative importance (RI) scores were >16.67% (the value if all attributes were of equal importance). Preference weight scores were assessed. A nine-point Likert scale assessed respondent attitudes, such as satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 51 respondents completed the survey. Respondents reported dissatisfaction with current treatments (mean [SD] = 5.4 [1.7]). For prescription selection, four attributes achieved RI >16.67%: taste/odor (24%), weight restrictions (21%), preparation instructions (18%), and route of administration (17%). For adherence, three attributes related to administration achieved RI >16.67%: taste/odor (28%), preparation instructions (21%), and route of administration (17%). Preference weights for ""taste/odor masked"" were higher than ""not taste/odor masked"" for prescription selection (mean [SD]; 1.52 [1.10] vs -1.52 [1.10]) and treatment adherence (73.8 [55.2] vs -73.8 [55.2]). LIMITATIONS: This study contained a relatively small sample size. Survey respondent selection, the use of hypothetical product profiles, and exclusion of non-pharmacologic treatment options could have contributed to potential biases. CONCLUSIONS: Among attributes tested, taste/odor was the most important attribute influencing overall preference for both prescribing and patient adherence, with taste/odor masking preferred. Optimizing nitrogen-binding medications through masking taste/odor may support improved patient adherence and outcomes in UCDs.",1
Peer Support in Rheumatic Diseases: A Narrative Literature Review.,"Rheumatic diseases are a group of chronic conditions that are associated with significant morbidity, impaired physical function, psychosocial stress, and cost to the healthcare system. Peer support interventions have been shown to have a positive impact on health outcomes in several chronic conditions, but no review has specifically assessed the impact of peer support on rheumatic conditions. The aim of this narrative literature review was to understand how peer support has been applied in the field of rheumatology, with a specific focus on the impact of observational and randomized studies of direct peer support interventions on various outcome measures across rheumatic conditions. We also examined studies exploring patient attitudes and preferences toward peer support. The majority of studies included focused on peer support in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Generally, patients across the spectrum of rheumatic disease perceive peer support as a useful tool. Peer support interventions, while highly variable, were generally associated with positive impacts on health-related quality of life metrics (both perceived and measured), although these differences were not always statistically significant. Important limitations include variability in study design, selection bias among study participants, and short follow-up periods across most peer support interventions.",0
Management strategies for antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction.,"Antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction is one of the most frequently met adverse effects for individuals suffering from major depressive disorder. When primary prevention by non-pharmacological measures fails, empirical coping strategies might be proposed. In this article, we present a brief overview of pharmacological strategies for antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction, considering antidepressants and conceivable corrective medications. We suggest dividing these strategies into three groups: (1) tapering (dose reduction, therapeutic window or short-term treatment interruption); (2) maintenance (focusing on spontaneous remission); (3) optimizing treatment (substitution for another antidepressant or addition of treatments to correct sexual side effects). Whichever strategy is selected, we encourage the clinician to propose the most adequate therapeutic option for the patient, while considering the efficacy and overall tolerance of the current antidepressant strategy, the affected phase of sexuality and patient preferences and gender. This summary is limited to antidepressant treatments and correctors marketed in France and aimed at a clinician reading to help manage patients suffering from antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.",0
The relevance of fatigue to relapse rate in multiple sclerosis: Applying patient preference data to the OPTIMUM trial.,"BACKGROUND: In the OPTIMUM trial in patients with relapsing MS, treatment differences in annualized relapse rate (ARR, 0.088) and change in fatigue at week 108 (3.57 points, measured using the Fatigue Symptoms and Impacts Questionnaire-Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis, symptom domain (FSIQ-RMS-S)) favored ponesimod over teriflunomide. However, the importance of the fatigue outcome to patients was unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the importance of the OPTIMUM FSIQ-RMS-S results using data from an MS discrete choice experiment (DCE). METHODS: The DCE included components to correlate levels of physical and cognitive fatigue with FSIQ-RMS-S scores. Changes in relapses/year and time to MS progression equivalent to the treatment difference in fatigue in OPTIMUM were determined for similar fatigue levels as mean baseline fatigue in OPTIMUM. RESULTS: DCE participants would accept 0.06 more relapses/year or a 0.15-0.17 year decrease in time to MS progression for a 3.57-point difference in physical fatigue on the FSIQ-RMS-S. To improve cognitive fatigue by 3.57-points on the FSIQ-RMS-S, DCE participants would accept 0.09-0.10 more relapses/year or a 0.24-0.28 year decrease in time to MS progression. CONCLUSION: MS patients would accept 0.06 more relapses/year to change their fatigue by a similar magnitude as the between-treatment difference observed in the OPTIMUM trial.",1
"A care substitution service in the Netherlands: impact on referral, cost, and patient satisfaction.","BACKGROUND: In care substitution services, medical specialists offer brief consultations to provide general practitioners (GPs) with advice on diagnosis, treatment, or hospital referral. When GPs serve as gatekeepers to secondary care, these regional services could reduce pressures on healthcare systems. The aim is to determine the impact of implementing a care substitution service for dermatology, orthopaedics, and cardiology on the hospital referral rate, health care costs, and patient satisfaction. METHODS: A before-after study was used to evaluate hospital referral rates and health care costs during a follow-up period of 1 year. The study population comprised patients with eligible International Classification of Primary Care codes for referral to the care substitution service (only dermatology, orthopaedic, cardiology indications), as pre-defined by GPs and medical specialists. We compared referral rates before and after implementation by χ(2) tests and evaluated patient preference by qualitative analysis. RESULTS: In total, 4,930 patients were included, 2,408 before and 2,522 after implementation. The care substitution service decreased hospital referrals during the follow-up period from 15 to 11%. The referral rate decreased most for dermatology (from 15 to 9%), resulting in a cost reduction of €10.59 per patient, while the other two specialisms experienced smaller reductions in referral rates. Patients reported being satisfied, mainly because of the null cost, improved organisation, improved care, and positive experience of the consultation. CONCLUSIONS: The care substitution service showed promise for specialisms that require fewer hospital facilities, as exemplified by dermatology.",0

National trends in osteoporosis medication use among Medicare beneficiaries with and without Alzheimer's disease/related dementias.,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporotic fractures  are a leading cause of disability and premature death in the elderly. Patients with Alzheimer's and related dementia (ADRD) have high rates of osteoporosis (OP) and substantial risk of osteoporotic fractures. Yet research is sparse on trends and predictors of OP medication use in ADRD. METHODS: Medicare beneficiaries with OP aged ≥ 67 years have Medicare parts A/B/D without HMO from 2016 to 2018. Our outcome was receipt of OP medications in 2018. A multivariable logistic regression assessed association between ADRD and OP drug prescribing, adjusted for age, sex, race, region, Medicare entitlement, dual Medicaid eligibility, chronic conditions, number of provider visits/hospitalizations, and nursing home (NH) resident status. Age/ADRD and NH residency/ADRD interactions were tested. RESULTS: Our sample consisted of 47,871 people with OP and ADRD and 201,840 with OP without ADRD. OP drug use was 38.6% in ADRD patients vs. 52.7% in non-ADRD. After adjustment for demographics, chronic conditions, and previous hospitalizations/physician visits, the OR for OP drug in ADRD vs. non-ADRD was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.83-0.87). NH residents had lower odds for OP medication (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.58-0.64). There were significant interactions between ADRD and age, and between ADRD and NH residency. The OR for OP drug use associated with ADRD was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86-0.90) among community-dwelling elders and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.64-0.69) among NH residents. CONCLUSIONS: ADRD patients received OP drugs at a lower rate than their non-ADRD counterparts. More research is needed on when to prescribe or deprescribe OP drugs in the context of different ADRD severity, patient preferences, remaining life expectancy, and time-to-benefit from OP drugs.",0
The Place of Immune Reconstitution Therapy in the Management of Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis in France: An Expert Consensus.,"The treatment strategy in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) is a complex decision requiring individualization of treatment sequences to maximize clinical outcomes. Current local and international guidelines do not provide specific recommendation on the use of immune reconstitution therapy (IRT) as alternative to continuous immunosuppression in the management of RMS. The objective of the program was to provide consensus-based expert opinion on the optimal use of IRT in the management of RMS. A Delphi method was performed from May 2022 to July 2022. Nineteen clinical assertions were developed by a scientific committee and sent to 14 French clinical experts in MS alongside published literature. Two consecutive reproducible anonymous votes were conducted. Consensus on recommendations was achieved when more than 75% of the respondents agreed or disagreed with the clinical assertions. After the second round, consensus was achieved amongst 16 out of 19 propositions: 13 clinical assertions had a 100% consensus, 3 clinical assertions a consensus above 75% and 3 without consensus. Expert-agreed consensus is provided on topics related to the benefit of the early use of IRT from immunological and clinical perspectives, profiles of patients who may benefit most from the IRT strategy (e.g. patients with family planning, patient preference and lifestyle requirements). These French expert consensuses provide up-to-date relevant guidance on the use of IRT in clinical practice. The current program reflects status of knowledge in 2022 and should be updated in timely manner when further clinical data in IRT become available.",0
Atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation in patients hospitalised for stroke in the REGIONS Care Study.,"AIM: To describe atrial fibrillation (AF) patient characteristics and anticoagulation patterns in stroke patients in Aotearoa. METHODS: Reducing Ethnic and Geographic Inequities to Optimise New Zealand Stroke (REGIONS) Care study is a prospective, nation-wide observational study of consecutive adult stroke patients admitted to hospital between 1 May and 31 October 2018. AF and anticoagulation prescribing, intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and differences by Māori ethnicity and hospital location are described. RESULTS: Of 2,379 patients, 807 (34.3%) had a diagnosis of AF. AF patients were older than non-AF patients (mean 79.9 [SD 11] versus 72.5 [14.2], p<0.0001). AF was diagnosed before stroke in 666 patients (82.5%), of whom 442 (66.4%) were taking an anticoagulant. The most common documented reasons for non-anticoagulation were prior bleeding (20.5%), patient preference (18.1%), frailty, comorbidities/side effects (13.2%) and falls (6.8%). The ICH rate was similar for AF patients on versus not on an anticoagulant (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-1.80). Rates and reasons for oral anticoagulant non-prescribing were similar for Māori, non-Māori, urban and non-urban populations. CONCLUSIONS: Although anticoagulation prescribing in AF has improved, one third of stroke patients with known AF were not taking an anticoagulant prior to admission and the majority did not appear to have an absolute contraindication offering a multidisciplinary opportunity for improvement. There were no significant differences for Māori and non-urban populations in anticoagulant prescribing.",0
Patient preferences and shared decision making for the traditional Chinese medicine treatment of lung cancer: A discrete choice experiment study.,"BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), integrating patient preferences into decision-making process, has been widely used in the multimodality therapy of lung cancer. This study aimed to estimate patient preferences for treatment and shared decision-making (SDM) modes concerning inpatient TCM treatment of lung cancer in Shanghai in order to provide a basis for clinical decision-making process on TCM therapy for lung cancer. METHODS: This study was conducted among patients (n = 347) from nine tertiary hospitals in Shanghai by discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey and Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire-patient version (SDM-Q-9) survey. The DCE was developed with the inclusion of the most relevant attributes at appropriate levels for the TCM treatment of lung cancer. The empirical data analyses of patients were performed using mixed logit models. Additionally, subgroup analysis was conducted. RESULTS: In total, 347 respondents completed the questionnaire. All attributes' coefficients were statistically significant for patients' preferences. Patients showed strong preferences for increasing disease control rate, relieving nausea and vomiting, reducing the risk of side effects, and were concerned about monthly out-of-pocket costs. Subgroup analysis indicated that patients with a lower SDM-Q-9 score and those who were satisfied with medical services emphasized more importance of higher disease control rate. Furthermore, most of the patients (90.20%) self-reported a high willingness to use SDM during the decision-making process. CONCLUSION: In Shanghai, patients mainly preferred SDM and considered disease control rate as the most essential attribute in the TCM treatment of lung cancer. The study findings could underscore the importance of considering patients' preferences and promote SDM.",1
Patient Choice and Motivators: Should Behavioral Economics Inform The Plan of Care?,.,0
Selecting Optimal First-Line Treatment for Microsatellite Stable and Non-Mutated RAS/BRAF Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.,"Standard frontline treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is cytotoxic chemotherapy plus a biologic agent such as an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (cetuximab or panitumumab) or anti-VEGF antibody (bevacizumab). Predictive biomarkers include mismatch repair (MMR) status, and RAS and BRAF mutation status; and important factors in treatment selection include primary tumor location, intent of therapy, and potential toxicity, as well as patient age, comorbidities, and patient preference. To date, single-, double-, or triple-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy all have important roles in appropriately selected patients, with the addition of anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR antibody therapy based on the relevant predictive biomarker. Data indicate that patients with proficient MMR, RAS/BRAF wt mCRC are candidates for an anti-EGFR antibody plus doublet chemotherapy if they have a left-sided primary tumor, or for anti-VEGF (bevacizumab) plus doublet or triplet chemotherapy if they have a right-sided primary tumor. Future studies may provide more predictive biomarkers to further personalize therapy for this heterogeneous disease.",0
Advance Directives.,"Advance directives are legal documents that outline an individual's preferences regarding major medical decisions. These directives specify the healthcare options that an individual desires or rejects, currently and in the future. In addition, advance directives designate one or more individuals who will act as spokespersons on behalf of the patient if they become unable to communicate their preferences. There are variations in advance directive laws from state to state. Several states have implemented specific forms of advance directives, such as Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST), Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST), Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment (MOST), Physician Orders for Scope of Treatment (POST), Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) Order/Clinician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (COLST), Transportable Physician Orders for Patient Preferences (TPOPP), or similar directives have been introduced. These forms condense the essential elements of an advance directive into a medical order format. To maintain brevity, the term ""POLST"" will be applied to encompass all the variations above in the remainder of this article.",0
SEOM-GEMCAD-TTD clinical guidelines for the systemic treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (2022).,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in Spain. Metastatic disease is present in 15-30% of patients at diagnosis and up to 20-50% of those with initially localized disease eventually develop metastases. Recent scientific knowledge acknowledges that this is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous disease. As treatment options increase, prognosis for individuals with metastatic disease has steadily improved over recent decades. Disease management should be discussed among experienced, multidisciplinary teams to select the most appropriate systemic treatment (chemotherapy and targeted agents) and to integrate surgical or ablative procedures, when indicated. Clinical presentation, tumor sidedness, molecular profile, disease extension, comorbidities, and patient preferences are key factors when designing a customized treatment plan. These guidelines seek to provide succinct recommendations for managing metastatic CRC.",0
Using Patient Preferences in Health Technology Assessment: Evaluating Quality-Adjusted Survival Equivalents (QASE) for the Quantification of Non-health Benefits.,"Interest in using patient preference (PP) data alongside traditional economic models in health technology assessment (HTA) is growing, including using PP data to quantify non-health benefits. However, this is limited by a lack of standardised methods. In this article, we describe a method for using discrete choice experiment (DCE) data to estimate the value of non-health benefits in terms of quality-adjusted survival equivalence (QASE), which is consistent with the concept of value prevalent among HTA agencies. We describe how PP data can be used to estimate QASE, assess the ability to test the face-validity of QASE estimates of changes in mode of administration calculated from five published DCE oncology studies and review the methodological and normative considerations associated with using QASE to support HTA. We conclude that QASE may have some methodological advantages over alternative methods, but this requires DCEs to estimate second-order effects between length and quality of life. In addition, empirical work has yet to be undertaken to substantiate this advantage and demonstrate the validity of QASE. Further work is also required to align QASE with normative objectives of HTA agencies. Estimating QASE would also have implications for the conduct of DCEs, including standardising and defining more clear attribute definitions.",1
Validation of the Korean Version of Patient-Centered Care Tool: For Outpatients.,"AIM: The objective of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of the Korean version of the patient-centered care (K-PCC) instrument for outpatients. The study was conducted due to the absence of a measurement tool specifically designed to evaluate patient-centered care for outpatients. DESIGN: This study is a methodological study to verify the validity and reliability of the Korean version of Patient-Centered Care (K-PCC) to measure patient-centeredness for outpatients. METHODS: As a first step for the evaluation of the tool, the content validity was verified by expert panel. Then, a total of 400 outpatients were recruited, and construct validity was verified through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) as the second step for the evaluation of the tool. The convergent and discriminant validity of the tool was verified by calculating the standardized factor loads, construct reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE), and calculating the correlation square between the factors as the third and fourth steps for the evaluation of the tool. And as a fifth step for the evaluation of the tool, criterion validity was evaluated by comparing the correlation with the patient-centeredness measurement tool for inpatients (PEx-inpatient). In estimating reliability, internal consistency reliability coefficients were calculated. RESULTS: The confirmatory factor analysis supported good fit for the Korean patient-centered care instrument (K-PCC), and the eight-factor structure was validated. The scale comprises 21 items across eight factors: patient preferences (4 items), physical comfort (2 items), coordination of care (2 items), continuity and transition (3 items), emotional support (2 items), access to medical care (3 items), information and education (2 items), and family and friends (3 items). The Cronbach's alphas ranging between 0.73 and 0.88. CONCLUSION: The Korean patient-centered primary care instrument is a valid and reliable scale to measure patient-centered care for outpatients in the Korean medical environment.",0
Recent advances and controversial issues in the optimal management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis.,"OBJECTIVE: The optimal management of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (AsxCS) is enduringly controversial. We updated our 2021 Expert Review and Position Statement, focusing on recent advances in the diagnosis and management of patients with AsxCS. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed up to August 1, 2023, using PubMed/PubMed Central, EMBASE and Scopus. The following keywords were used in various combinations: ""asymptomatic carotid stenosis,"" ""carotid endarterectomy"" (CEA), ""carotid artery stenting"" (CAS), and ""transcarotid artery revascularization"" (TCAR). Areas covered included (i) improvements in best medical treatment (BMT) for patients with AsxCS and declining stroke risk, (ii) technological advances in surgical/endovascular skills/techniques and outcomes, (iii) risk factors, clinical/imaging characteristics and risk prediction models for the identification of high-risk AsxCS patient subgroups, and (iv) the association between cognitive dysfunction and AsxCS. RESULTS: BMT is essential for all patients with AsxCS, regardless of whether they will eventually be offered CEA, CAS, or TCAR. Specific patient subgroups at high risk for stroke despite BMT should be considered for a carotid revascularization procedure. These patients include those with severe (≥80%) AsxCS, transcranial Doppler-detected microemboli, plaque echolucency on Duplex ultrasound examination, silent infarcts on brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography scans, decreased cerebrovascular reserve, increased size of juxtaluminal hypoechoic area, AsxCS progression, carotid plaque ulceration, and intraplaque hemorrhage. Treatment of patients with AsxCS should be individualized, taking into consideration individual patient preferences and needs, clinical and imaging characteristics, and cultural, ethnic, and social factors. Solid evidence supporting or refuting an association between AsxCS and cognitive dysfunction is lacking. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal management of patients with AsxCS should include BMT for all individuals and a prophylactic carotid revascularization procedure (CEA, CAS, or TCAR) for some asymptomatic patient subgroups, additionally taking into consideration individual patient needs and preference, clinical and imaging characteristics, social and cultural factors, and the available stroke risk prediction models. Future studies should investigate the association between AsxCS with cognitive function and the role of carotid revascularization procedures in the progression or reversal of cognitive dysfunction.",0
