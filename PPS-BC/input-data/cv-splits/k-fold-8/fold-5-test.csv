Preferences for disease-related information and transitional skills among adolescents with congenital heart disease in the early transitional stage.,"PURPOSE: The transition towards adult-focused healthcare comprises a complex process requiring careful, individualized guidance of adolescents with congenital heart disease (CHD). Detailed data on their preferences regarding disease-related information and acquirable transitional skills are mostly lacking. We examined the preferences of CHD adolescents in the early transition stage. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed with adolescents recruited from a transition program. Two questionnaires assessing needs for information and transitional skills were used. Only questionnaires completed in the early transition stage were included. RESULTS: Forty-nine adolescents participated (mean age 15.9 ± 1.2 years, 43% girls). 59% requested information about their heart and previous and/or future surgeries/interventions, 45% about sports and medication, and a maximum of 27% about psychosocial topics. More girls than boys requested surgical information (76% versus 46%; p = 0.04). Adolescents with severely complex CHD more often requested information about medication than those with moderately complex CHD (63% versus 28%; p = 0.02). Older adolescents were less likely to request surgical information (OR = 0.53; 95%CI [0.26-0.88]; p = 0.03). Up to 83% of the adolescents perceived their skills as insufficient, but less than 14% was interested in acquiring skills.    Conclusion: Adolescents were mainly interested in medical topics, followed by lifestyle information. The informational needs tended to decrease with age. Timely gauging individual needs and delivering information, ideally in the early teens, appear important when providing person-tailored transitional care in CHD. Paradoxically, although the transitional skills were low-perceived, there was limited motivation to improve them. This paradox requires further investigation to better tailor transition interventions.     Clinical trial registration: Not applicable. WHAT IS KNOWN: • Transition towards adult life and care requires careful patient guidance. A person-tailored approach is strongly encouraged. However, details on preferences regarding disease-related information and transitional skills are scarce in adolescents with CHD. WHAT IS NEW: • This study showed that adolescents with CHD in early transition mainly need medical-related information. Their informational needs tend to decrease with age necessitating timely gauging for interest and delivering information. Adolescents report a low need to acquire transitional skills despite low self-esteemed skills levels.",0
Discrete Choice Experiments in Health State Valuation: A Systematic Review of Progress and New Trends.,"BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are increasingly used in health state valuation studies. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review updates the progress and new findings of DCE studies in the health state valuation, covering the period since the review of June 2018 to November 2022. The review reports the methods that are currently being used in DCE studies to value health and study design characteristics, and, for the first time, reviews DCE health state valuation studies published in the Chinese language. METHODS: English language databases PubMed and Cochrane, and Chinese language databases Wanfang and CNKI were searched using the self-developed search terms. Health state valuation or methodology study papers were included if the study used DCE data to generate a value set for a preference-based measure. Key information extracted included DCE study design strategies applied, methods for anchoring the latent coefficient on to a 0-1 QALY scale and data analysis methods. RESULTS: Sixty-five studies were included; one Chinese language publication and 64 English language publications. The number of health state valuation studies using DCE has rapidly increased in recent years and these have been conducted in more countries than prior to 2018. Wide usage of DCE with duration attributes, D-efficient design and models accounting for heterogeneity has continued in recent years. Although more methodological consensus has been found than in studies conducted prior to 2018, this consensus may be driven by valuation studies for common measures with an international protocol (the 'model' valuation research). Valuing long measures with well-being attributes attracted attention and more realistic design strategies (e.g., inconstant time preference, efficient design and implausible states design) were identified. However, more qualitative and quantitative methodology study is still necessary to evaluate the effect of those new methods. CONCLUSIONS: The use of DCEs in health state valuation continues to grow dramatically and the methodology progress makes the method more reliable and pragmatic. However, study design is driven by international protocols and method selection is not always justified. There is no gold standard for DCE design, presentation format or anchoring method. More qualitative and quantitative methodology study is recommended to evaluate the effect of new methods before researchers make methodology decisions.",1
"Aortic valve replacement in non-elderly: the gap between reality, guidelines and evidence.","OBJECTIVES: There are several treatment options for non-elderly adults (18-60 years) in need of aortic valve replacement (AVR): a mechanical or biological substitute, a homograft, the Ross procedure or nowadays even transcatheter aortic valve replacement. This study evaluated the current opinions and practices of cardiac surgeons and cardiologists concerning AVR strategies in this patient group. METHODS: A 43-item online survey was sent out to several scientific organizations, individual cardiac surgeons, cardiologists and residents/fellows worldwide. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two physicians from 33 different countries answered the survey. The UK (24%), Belgium (23%) and North America (22%) are best represented. A mechanical valve is the most frequently used substitute in non-elderly. With increasing patient age, the popularity of a biological valve increases. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement and the Ross procedure are each used in <10% of this cohort. Only 12% of the cardiac surgeons has experience with the Ross surgery. In 23%, the patient seems not to be involved in the decision on the type of valve substitute. CONCLUSIONS: The preferred surgical treatment for non-elderly patients in need of AVR differs widely. To enable a shared decision-making process including patient preferences, there is more need for collaboration between cardiac departments, as well as education and scientific research about patient-centred outcomes of the different AVR techniques.",0
Updated Immunotherapy for Gastric Cancer.,"Gastric cancer treatments are evolving rapidly. For example, immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially those that target PD-1 or PD-L1, have long-term efficacy in a subset of gastric cancer patients, and are currently the first-line therapy. Immunotherapies approved for use in untreated gastric cancer patients include monotherapy and chemotherapy-immunotherapy combinations. Major clinical trials have reported efficacy and safety data suggesting that PD-L1 expression is important for regimen selection, although other biomarkers, clinicopathologic factors, and patient preference might also be relevant in other situations. Currently, several novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies are being assessed, which might refine the current treatment paradigm. In this review, we describe the current treatment regimens for patients with gastric cancer and detail the approach we use for the selection of first-line immunotherapy regimens.",0
Urological Guidelines for Kidney Stones: Overview and Comprehensive Update.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based guidelines are published by urological organisations for various conditions, including urolithiasis. In this paper, we provide guidance on the management of kidney stone disease (KSD) and compare the American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urologists (EAU) guidelines. METHODS: We evaluate and appraise the evidence and grade of recommendation provided by the AUA and EAU guidelines on urolithiasis (both surgical and medical management). RESULTS: Both the AUA and EAU guidelines provide guidance on the type of imaging, treatment options, and medical therapies and advice on specific patient groups, such as in paediatrics and pregnancy. While the guidelines are generally aligned and based on evidence, some subtle differences exist in the recommendations, but both are generally unanimous for the majority of the principles of management. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that the guidelines should undergo regular updates based on recently published material, and while these guidelines provide a framework, treatment plans should still be personalised, respecting patient preferences, surgical expertise, and various other individual factors, to offer the best outcome for kidney stone patients.",0
Prosthesis preferences for those with upper limb loss: Discrete choice study of PULLTY® for use in regulatory decisions.,"INTRODUCTION: The patient's voice in shared decision-making has progressed from physician's office to regulatory decision-making for medical devices with FDA's Patient Preference Initiative. A discrete-choice preference measure for upper limb prosthetic devices was developed to investigate patient's risk/benefit preference choices for regulatory decision making. METHODS: Rapid ethnographic procedures were used to design a discrete-choice measure describing risk and benefits of osseointegration with myoelectric control and test in a pilot preference study in adults with upper limb loss. Primary outcome is utility of each choice based conjoint (CBC) attribute using mixed-effects regression. Utilities with and without video, and between genders were compared. RESULTS: Strongest negative preference was for avoiding infection risk (B = -1.77, p < 0.001) and chance of daily pain (B = -1.22, p, 0.001). Strongest positive preference was for attaining complete independence when cooking dinner (B = 1.62, p < 0.001) and smooth grip patterns at all levels (B = 1.62, B = 1.28, B = 1.26, p < 0.001). Trade-offs showed a 1% increase in risk of serious/treatable infection resulted in a 1.77 decrease in relative preference. There were gender differences, and where video was used, preferences were stronger. CONCLUSIONS: Strongest preferences were for attributes of functionality and independence versus connectedness and sensation but showed willingness to make risk-benefit trade-offs. Findings provide valuable information for regulatory benefit-risk decisions for prosthetic device innovations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is not a clinical trial reporting results of a health care intervention so is not registered.",1
Ablation versus Radiation Segmentectomy for Small Liver Tumors.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a liver malignancy that affects more than a million people worldwide with a complex multifactorial etiology. After the diagnosis of HCC is made, physicians establish management using the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) guidelines revolving around tumor stage, liver function, performance status, and patient preferences. According to recent updates to these guidelines, thermal ablation is the second-best curative option apart from surgical resection for small HCC (< 2 cm). While thermal ablation is standard of care, recent studies have suggested that radiation segmentectomy (RS) has similar outcomes, limited hepatotoxicity, and ultimately a cost-efficient approach. Although there is limited literature on RS, this article compares ablation techniques against radiation segmentectomy for small HCC tumors.",0
Development of a haemophilia A gene therapy shared decision-making tool for clinicians.,"INTRODUCTION: As gene therapies are incorporated into clinical practice, shared decision-making (SDM) is recommended for implementation. AIM: To inform development of a clinician SDM tool for haemophilia A gene therapy. METHODS: Clinicians at US Hemophilia Treatment Centers completed semi-structured interviews about their experience with SDM and provided feedback on a clinician SDM tool prototype. Interviews were transcribed verbatim for coding and thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Ten participants enrolled, eight physicians and two haemophilia nurses. All participants care for adults with haemophilia (1-27 years of experience) and 7 have gene therapy trials open at their institution. Confidence in having a clinical discussion about gene therapy included none (N = 1), slight (N = 3), moderate (N = 5) and high (N = 1). All participants reported familiarity with SDM and agreed that the tool would be useful for their clinical practice. Key themes in participant feedback for the tool were (1) language and presentation; (2) content; and (3) implementation. Participants highlighted the importance of providing unbiased information and having companion tools with patient-centric language. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the need for SDM tools for haemophilia A gene therapy. Key information to include in the tool are safety, efficacy, cost and detailed information on the gene therapy process. Data should be provided in an unbiased format and allow comparison to other treatments. The tool will be evaluated in clinical practice and refined as clinical trial data and real-world experience mature.",0
Literature review and guide for optimal position in implant-based breast reconstruction.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Identification of ideal candidates for prepectoral versus retropectoral implant-based breast reconstruction relies on careful preoperative risk assessment and intraoperative flap evaluation. Few guidelines exist to guide the surgeon's decision-making process when evaluating the preferred plane for implant placement. METHODS: A literature review was performed to develop clinical decision-making algorithms for direct-to-implant (DTI) reconstruction with acellular dermal matrix (ADM) for patients undergoing prophylactic or therapeutic nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) based on patient characteristics, surgical techniques, and outcomes. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: Prepectoral reconstruction is most suitable for patients with small breasts or macromastia with desire for breast reduction, low-grade ptosis, smaller implant sizes, those undergoing PMRT, and for those who aim to mitigate animation deformity and capsular contracture. Retropectoral reconstruction may be recommended for patients with larger breasts with no desire for size change requiring additional prosthesis support, and in patients who aim to reduce likelihood of rippling and need for subsequent fat grafting procedures to address contour abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Careful preoperative and intraoperative assessment of reconstruction options for patients undergoing implant-based breast reconstruction is necessary to mitigate complications and produce superior aesthetic outcomes. Decision algorithms may be used to determine ideal surgical techniques based on patient factors, like radiation history and planning, breast size and ptosis, and patient preferences.",0
Patient-centered care outcomes for patients in the emergency department with a non-English language preference: A scoping review.,"OBJECTIVE: This review highlights what is known about patient-centered care outcomes (PCCOs) for emergency department (ED) patients with non-English language preferences (NELP). METHODS: Four databases were searched and included article were written in English, presented primary evidence, published in a peer-reviewed journal, and reported PCCOs from the perspective of ED patients with NELP. PCCOs were defined using the Institute of Medicine definition, outcomes that evaluate respect and responsiveness to patient preferences, needs and values. Two reviewers assessed all articles, extracted data, and resolved discrepancies. PCCOs were grouped in categories (needs, preferences, and values) based on the definition's domains. RESULTS: Of the 6524 potentially eligible studies, 20 met inclusion criteria. Of these, 16 focused on needs; 4 on preferences and 8 on values. Within patient need, five studies found a large unmet need for language services. Within patient value, three found that language discordance negatively influenced perceptions of care. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies in this review found that not speaking English negatively influenced perceptions of care and highlighted a large unmet need for language services in the ED. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: More work needs to be done to characterize PCCOs in ED patients with NELP and develop interventions to improve care.",0
Engaging psoriasis patients in adherence and outcomes to topical treatments: A summary from the Symposium 'Tailoring topical psoriasis treatments to patients' needs and expectations' of the 30(th) EADV Congress 2021.,"This article is based on a presentation given by authors at the Satellite Symposium titled 'Tailoring topical psoriasis treatments to patients' needs and expectations' held during the 30(th) European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress. During this session, the factors affecting adherence and outcomes to topical treatments were presented, with a particular focus on the patients' point of view. Psoriasis is not just a skin condition. Psoriasis can cause negative psychosocial effects, such as depression and anxiety. The risk of suicidality in patients with psoriasis is higher than in the background population. Psychosocial comorbidities can be prevented by patient involvement in psoriasis management and need to be treated in a multidisciplinary manner. Adherence may be the largest barrier to treatment success with topical therapies. Improvement in several areas of disease management may lead to benefits in treatment adherence and hence clinical benefit. There are several treatment-related factors for non-adherence, such as patient dissatisfaction, side effects, treatment regimen or the drug vehicle. Delivering comprehensive treatment information to the patient will help develop realistic objectives and expectations. Patients need to be involved in the selection of treatment strategies, as psoriasis patients have various preferences for their use of topical treatments. A shared decision-making with the patient has been shown to improve medication adherence and treatment success. Prescribing therapy in line with a patient preference for treatment vehicle and improving the communication between healthcare professionals and patients may be key factors to maximize adherence. The calcipotriol (CAL) and betamethasone dipropionate (BDP) cream, a novel formulation of the CAL/BDP fixed-dose combination based on Poly-Aphron Dispersion (PAD) Technology, is a topical treatment of mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis, including scalp psoriasis, that has high cosmetic acceptance and overall treatment satisfaction.",0
Attributing practice variation by its sources: the case of varicose veins treatments in the Netherlands.,"BACKGROUND: Unwarranted practice variation refers to regional differences in treatments that are not driven by patients' medical needs or preferences. Although it is the subject of numerous studies, most research focuses on variation at the end stage of treatment, i.e. the stage of the treating specialist, disregarding variation stemming from other sources (e.g. patient preferences, general practitioner referral patterns). In the present paper, we introduce a method that allows us to measure regional variation at different stages of the patient journey leading up to treatment. METHODS: A series of logit regressions estimating the probability of (1) initial visit with the physician and (2) treatment correcting for patient needs and patient preferences. Calculating the coefficient of variation (CVU) at each stage of the patient journey. RESULTS: Our findings show large regional variations in the probability of receiving an initial visit, The CVU, or the measure of dispersion, in the regional probability of an initial visit with a specialist was significantly larger (0.87-0.96) than at the point of treatment both conditional (0.14-0.25) and unconditional on an initial visit (0.65-0.74), suggesting that practice variation was present before the patient reached the specialist. CONCLUSIONS: We present a new approach to attribute practice variation to different stages in the patient journey. We demonstrate our method using the clinically-relevant segment of varicose veins treatments. Our findings demonstrate that irrespective of the gatekeeping role of general practitioners (GPs), a large share of practice variation in the treatment of varicose veins is attributable to regional variation in primary care referrals. Contrary to expectation, specialists' decisions meaningfully diminish rather than increase the amount of regional variation.",0
"""Whatever journey you want to take, I'll support you through"": a mixed methods evaluation of a peer worker program in the hospital emergency department.","BACKGROUND: People who are unhoused, use substances (drugs and/or alcohol), and who have mental health conditions experience barriers to care access and are frequently confronted with discrimination and stigma in health care settings. The role of Peer Workers in addressing these gaps in a hospital-based context is not well characterized. The aim of this evaluation was to 1) outline the role of Peer Workers in the care of a marginalized populations in the emergency department; 2) characterize the impact of Peer Workers on patient care, and 3) to describe how being employed as a Peer Worker impacts the Peer. METHODS: Through a concurrent mixed methods evaluation, we explore the role of Peer Workers in the care of marginalized populations in the emergency department at two urban hospitals in Toronto, Ontario Canada. We describe the demographic characteristics of patients (n = 555) and the type of supports provided to patients collected through a survey between February and June 2022. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were completed with Peer Workers (n = 7). Interviews were thematically analyzed using a deductive approach, complemented by an inductive approach to allow new themes to emerge from the data. RESULTS: Support provided to patients primarily consisted of friendly conversations (91.4%), discharge planning (59.6%), tactics to help the patient navigate their emotions/mental wellbeing (57.8%) and sharing their lived experience (50.1%). In over one third (38.9%) of all patient interactions, Peer Workers shared new information about the patient with the health care team (e.g., obtaining patient identification). Five major themes emerged from our interviews with Peer Workers which include: (1) Establishing empathy and building trust between the patient and their care team through self-disclosure; (2) Facilitating a person-centered approach to patient care through trauma-informed listening and accessible language; (3) Support for patient preferences on harm reduction; (4) Peer worker role facilitating self-acceptance and self-defined recovery; and (5) Importance of supports and resources to help Peer Workers navigate the emotional intensity of the emergency department. CONCLUSIONS: The findings add to the literature on Peer Worker programs and how such interventions are designed to best meet the needs of marginalized populations.",0
Defect-Oriented Versus Back Scar-Oriented Flap Design in Breast Reconstruction with Latissimus Dorsi Musculocutaneous Flap: A Patient-Reported Satisfaction Outcome Comparison Using BREAST-Q.,"BACKGROUND: The design of the latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap in breast reconstruction has several options. To date, there have been no reports on the surgical outcomes with flap designed based on the defect shape of the mastectomy site and flap shape of the donor site. To compare patient satisfaction according to the flap design, we designed and conducted independent three sub-studies targeting fifty-three breast reconstruction patients using BREAST-Q(©) scale. METHODS: In study 1, there was no difference in patient satisfaction between the group with the flap designed according to the shape of mastectomy defect (defect-oriented group) that with the flap designed according to patient's wish regardless of defect shape (back scar-oriented group). In study 2, comparing the results based on the shape of the flap, vertically designed flap showed a statistically significant difference in the psychosocial well-being. In study 3, comparing the results based on the shape of the defect, no significant difference was noted. RESULTS: Even though designing a donor flap based on the shape and orientation of the mastectomy defect has no statistical significance in patient satisfaction or quality of life compared with that based on the patient preference in placement of the donor site scar, the group with the vertical donor design showed better psychosocial well-being than the group with other shapes of the donor flap. By considering the advantages and disadvantages of each flap design, enhanced patient satisfaction and durability and natural aesthetic goal can be achieved. This is the first study to compare the differences in results according to the flap design method during breast reconstruction. Patient satisfaction according to the design of the flap was investigated in the form of a questionnaire survey, and the results were displayed. In addition to breast shape, donor scars and complications were also investigated. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Use of the Allium Round Posterior Stent for the Treatment of Recurrent Vesicourethral Anastomosis Stricture.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes of monopolar incision and Allium Round Posterior Stent (RPS) insertion for the treatment of recurrent vesicourethral anastomosis stricture. METHODS: Having a suprapubic catheter and an obstructed pattern with a peak flow rate (PFR) ≤12 mL/s on uroflowmetry were the indications for the surgery. Once the fibrotic vesicourethral anastomosis was incised, RPS was inserted at the level of vesicourethral anastomosis under fluoroscopic guidance. All the stents were removed at postoperative first year. Patients were evaluated 3months after stent removal. Objective cure was defined as no need to further treatments and PFR ≥12 mL/s while subjective cure was defined as having points <4 on Patient Global Impression of Improvements scale. RESULTS: Of the 30 patients with a median age 66 (52-74) enrolled in the study, 18 had a suprapubic catheter, remaining 12 had median PFR 5.2 (2-10) mL/s. Stent migration was noted in two patients, these stents were replaced by new ones. Stone formation was diagnosed in one patient, a pneumatic-lithotripsy was performed. The median follow-up time was 28 (4-60) months following stent removal. Six cases needed further treatment after removal. The median PFR of remaining 24 patients was 20 (16-30) mL/s (P = .001). The objective cure rate was 24/30(80%), the Patient Global Impression of Improvements scores varied from 1 to 2, meaning subjective cure rate was 24/30(80%). For the six failed cases, according to patient preferences a lifetime RPS insertion was planned. CONCLUSION: With its minimally invasive nature, reversibility, and acceptable success and complication rates, incision of anastomosis and insertion of the RPS for a 1-year duration is a promising option for the treatment of recurrent vesicourethral anastomosis stricture.",0
Hospital doctors' and general practitioners' perspectives of outpatient discharge processes in Australia: an interpretive approach.,"BACKGROUND: Unnecessary delays in patient discharge from hospital outpatient clinics have direct consequences for timely access of new patients and the length of outpatient waiting times. The aim of this study was to gain better understanding of hospital doctors' and general practitioners' perspectives of the barriers and facilitators when discharging from hospital outpatients to general practice. METHODS: An interpretative approach incorporating semi-structured interviews with 15 participants enabled both hospital doctors and general practitioners to give their perspectives on hospital outpatient discharge processes. RESULTS: Participants mentioned various system problems hampering discharge from hospital outpatient clinics to general practice, such as limitations of electronic communication tools, workforce and workload challenges, the absence of agreed discharge principles, and lack of benchmark data. Hospital clinicians may keep patients under their care out of a concern about lack of follow-up and an inability to escalate timely hospital care following discharge. Some hospital clinicians may have a personal preference to provide ongoing care in the outpatient setting. Other factors mentioned were insufficient supervision of junior doctors, a patient preference to remain under hospital care, and the ease of scheduling follow-up appointments. An effective handover process requires protected time, a systematic approach, and a supportive clinical environment including user-friendly electronic communication and clinical handover tools. Several system improvements and models of care were suggested, such as agreed discharge processes, co-designed between hospitals and general practice. Recording and sharing outpatient discharge data may assist to inform and motivate hospital clinicians and support the training of junior doctors. General practitioners participating in the study were prepared to provide continuation of care but require timely clinical management plans that can be applied in the community setting. A hospital re-entry pathway providing rapid access to outpatient hospital resources after discharge could act as a safety net and may be an alternative to the standard 12-month review in hospital outpatient clinics. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the barriers to discharge as mentioned in the literature and adds the perspectives of both hospital clinicians and general practitioners. Potential solutions were suggested including co-designed discharge policies, improved electronic communication tools and a rapid hospital review pathway following discharge.",0
Radiation Therapy Can Be Safely Incorporated into Pretransplantation Treatment Regimens for Patients with Multiple Myeloma.,"Primary treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) often involves systemic induction therapy (SIT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Radiation therapy (RT) is sometimes used for palliation; however, many practitioners avoid RT out of concern that future peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection required for ASCT may be compromised. In this study, we retrospectively examined the possible effect of RT on PBPC collection. We reviewed the charts of 732 patients with MM treated with RT at our institution from 1999 to 2017, including patients who received RT prior to PBPC collection for planned ASCT. RT plans (both MM and non-MM RT) were reviewed to estimate the percentage of bone marrow (BM) treated using published estimates of skeletal BM distribution. Statistics were performed using Pearson correlation and the t-test. The 732 MM patients included 485 planned for ASCT; of these, 223 received RT prior to PBPC collection and were included in the final cohort. The median age at PBPC collection was 59 years (range, 33 to 80 years). For SIT, patients received combination regimens including the following agents: bortezomib (142 patients; 64%), lenalidomide (111 patients; 50%), and alkylators (46 patients; 21%). Nine patients (4%) received dexamethasone alone. The median cumulative %BM treated per patient was 6.7 (range .0 to 47.4). The median RT dose was 24 Gy (range, 10.0 to 75.6 Gy). Mobilization was performed using granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone (189 patients; 85%), G-CSF with plerixafor (15 patients; 7%), or chemotherapy (19 patients; 9%). A median of 7.8 × 10(6) CD34(+)/kg PBPCs (range, .5 to 54.8× 10(6) CD34(+)/kg) were collected in a median of 3 (range, 1 to 9) apheresis procedures. One hundred ninety-six patients (99%) collected ≥2.0 × 10(6) CD34(+)/kg PBPCs, and 166 (83%) collected >5.0 × 10(6) CD34(+)/kg PBPCs. The number of PBPCs collected was not associated with %BM treated (P = .15) or RT dose (P = .56). The number of apheresis procedures performed was not associated with %BM treated (P = .54) or RT dose (P = .85). The amount of PBPCs collected did not differ significantly between patients receiving RT to the pelvis/sacrum (P = .20) and those receiving RT to the spine (P = .13). The time to platelet engraftment was longer for patients with higher %BM treated (P = .02). Eleven patients did not undergo a confirmed ASCT, owing to patient preference (3 patients), trial therapy (1 patient), comorbidities (1 patient), election for hospice (1 patient), inadequate collection (4 patients), or inadequate follow-up (1 patient). In our study cohort, RT prior to ASCT did not impair successful ASCT. RT must be carefully planned and delivered to ensure safe incorporation into pre-ASCT treatment regimens.",0
Impact of Telemedicine Modality on Quality Metrics in Diverse Settings: Implementation Science-Informed Retrospective Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: Video-based telemedicine (vs audio only) is less frequently used in diverse, low socioeconomic status settings. Few prior studies have evaluated the impact of telemedicine modality (ie, video vs audio-only visits) on clinical quality metrics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess telemedicine uptake and impact of visit modality (in-person vs video and phone visits) on primary care quality metrics in diverse, low socioeconomic status settings through an implementation science lens. METHODS: Informed by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework, we evaluated telemedicine uptake, assessed targeted primary care quality metrics by visit modality, and described provider-level qualitative feedback on barriers and facilitators to telemedicine implementation. RESULTS: We found marginally better quality metrics (ie, blood pressure and depression screening) for in-person care versus video and phone visits; de-adoption of telemedicine was marked within 2 years in our population. CONCLUSIONS: Following the widespread implementation of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of visit modality on quality outcomes, provider and patient preferences, as well as technological barriers in historically marginalized settings should be considered.",0
Choosing Or Losing In Behavioral Health: A Study Of Patients' Experiences Selecting Telehealth Versus In-Person Care.,"It is not known how the growth of telehealth has affected patients' choice of visit modalities (telehealth versus in person). In 2023 we conducted a mixed-methods study that paired a nationally representative survey of 2,071 adults (including 571 who used behavioral health services) and semistructured interviews with twenty-six people with depression or bipolar disorder. We explored patients' experiences with visit modality selection and their agency in the decision. Approximately one-third of patients receiving therapy or medication visits reported that their clinicians did not offer both modalities. Thirty-two percent reported that they did not typically receive their preferred modality, and 45 percent did not believe that their clinician considered their modality preferences. Qualitative findings revealed that some clinicians did not elicit patients' modality preferences. Perceived lack of choice affected satisfaction and rapport with clinicians and encouraged some people to seek care elsewhere. These findings highlight trade-offs in policies to preserve patient choice and approaches that clinicians can take to identify and accommodate patients' preferences.",0
Preferences for cardiovascular and pulmonary rehabilitation care: A discrete choice experiment among patients in Lebanon.,"OBJECTIVE: Patient preferences are important in designing optimal rehabilitation care. The aim of this study is to assess preferences for rehabilitation care among two groups of respondents. DESIGN: An online discrete choice experiment survey was carried out. SETTING: We use data for Lebanon, a country where rehabilitation care is still underdeveloped. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who have undergone or are currently undergoing rehabilitation treatment (users) and those who have not (yet) used rehabilitation care (non-users). INTERVENTION: Patients were asked to repeatedly choose between two hypothetical rehabilitation care packages with seven different attributes: attitude of the staff, travel time to clinic, out-of-pocket costs, medical equipment, rehabilitation plan, additional lifestyle education session, and support during rehabilitation care. MAIN MEASURES: Preference heterogeneity among patients with different characteristics was investigated using random effect binary logistic regression (software package Stata 15). RESULTS: In total, 126 respondents completed the survey. The most preferred attribute was an informal and friendly attitude of the staff followed by modern medical equipment, additional lifestyle education session via eHealth, and support during the rehabilitation program via phone call or SMS. Respondents were less in favor of going to the rehabilitation clinic and paying additional out-of-pocket costs for the rehabilitation treatment. This rank order was similar between users and non-users. CONCLUSION: Preferences of patients regarding the type of program chosen (eHealth or at clinical-based) need to be included in future rehabilitation programs. Improving patient experience with rehabilitation programs by giving the best care based on a patient-centered approach is essential.",1
A real-world retrospective single-centre study of the cost-effectiveness and long-term outcomes of pegylated interferon for chronic hepatitis B.,"BACKGROUND: Pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) is recommended as first-line therapy for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) but has significant side effects and is rarely used compared to oral nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA). There are limited recent clinical efficacy or economic analysis data comparing approved CHB therapy in North America. METHODS: This retrospective study examined clinical outcomes, off-treatment durability, and cost-effectiveness of Peg-IFN versus NA for CHB. Demographic (age, sex, ethnicity), clinical data (i.e., liver tests, hepatitis B virus DNA, serology, transient elastography) and documented side effects were collected by retrospective chart review of patients followed in the University of Calgary Liver Unit who received Peg-IFN therapy from January 2007 to December 2020. The cost-effectiveness of Peg-IFN versus NA therapy was modelled over a 10-year time horizon. RESULTS: Sixty-eight CHB patients were treated with Peg-IFN (median age 45.65, 74% male, 84% Asian); 50/68 (74%) completed 48 weeks of treatment with a median follow-up of 6.54 years (interquartile range 5.07). At the last known follow-up, 23/68 (34%) have not required NA treatment and one had HBsAg loss; 27 have been started on NA. Predictors of obtaining a sustained virological response included being hepatitis B e antigen-negative at treatment end and a quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen <1000 IU/mL. Economic modelling showed that finite Peg-IFN was not cost-effective versus NA at a 10-year time horizon. CONCLUSIONS: PEG-IFN remains a potential treatment for CHB although there is a significant intolerance/failure rate. Using PEG-IFN based on patient preference is reasonable and optimal patient selection may improve treatment cost-effectiveness.",0
The 2022 Updated European Association of Urology Guidelines on the Use of Adjuvant Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy for Renal Cell Carcinoma.,"In KEYNOTE-564, adjuvant pembrolizumab, a PD-1 antibody, significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) in localised clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) with a high risk of relapse. In 2021, the European Association of Urology RCC Guidelines Panel issued a weak recommendation for adjuvant pembrolizumab for high-risk ccRCC as defined by the trial until final overall survival data and results from other trials were available. Meanwhile, the primary DFS endpoints were not met for adjuvant atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor; IMmotion010), adjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab (CheckMate 914), or perioperative nivolumab (PROSPER). Owing to heterogeneity, a meta-analysis is not recommended. Pembrolizumab remains the only immune checkpoint inhibitor currently recommended in this setting. Overall survival data are immature and biomarkers to predict outcome are lacking. Uncertainty exists and overtreatment is occurring. Treatment decisions should be made with caution and with the involvement of each patient. PATIENT SUMMARY: New results from three trials of immunotherapy after surgery for kidney cancer to reduce the risk of recurrence showed no improvement with these treatments. These results are in contrast to an earlier study that showed that the antibody pembrolizumab did extend the time before kidney cancer recurrence, even though it is not yet clear if overall survival is longer. Thus, we cautiously recommend pembrolizumab as additional treatment in high-risk kidney cancer after surgery, but patient preference should be carefully considered and the risk of overtreatment should be discussed.",0
Representation of women in orthopaedic surgery: perception of barriers among undergraduate medical students in Saudi Arabia.,"BACKGROUND: While female participation has improved in several surgical specialties over time globally, no such increase has been observed in orthopaedic surgery over the past decades. The potential barriers to female participation are likely present from the beginning of medical education. Therefore, this study assessed the apparent lag in equal representation among men and women in orthopaedic surgery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a questionnaire survey to investigate medical students' and interns' perceptions of women participating in orthopaedic surgery, their subspeciality preferences, and barriers preventing them from pursuing an orthopaedic career. The responses were analysed to understand general perceptions, gender-based differences, impact of clinical experiential learning, and exposure to orthopaedic surgery. RESULTS: Approximately 565 medical students (49% females, 51% males) participated in the survey. Only 17% of students (11% females, 23% males) considered orthopaedic surgery as their future career option. While 31% of female and 17% of male students disagreed with the concept of female-appropriate orthopaedic subspecialties, most of the remaining male and female students perceived paediatric orthopaedics as a female-appropriate subspecialty. Concerning equal representation of women, gender bias and lack of a strong physique were the most frequently selected barriers by female and male students, respectively. Patient preference for male orthopaedicians, gender discrimination, social and family commitments, and need for physical strength were all perceived as barriers for women in orthopaedics. Overall, clinical experience and orthopaedic exposure did not significantly improve the likelihood of female students in choosing orthopaedic surgery as a career. CONCLUSIONS: The bias against women in orthopaedic careers is prevalent among medical students early in their academic years. Clinical experience and exposure to orthopaedic surgery should be improved to make a significant impact on female participation in orthopaedic careers. Career building efforts in terms of improved career opportunities, career counselling, flexible working hours, social and family related adjustments and implementation of mentorship/research/fellowship programmes for females are needed to reduce gender discrimination and improve female orthopaedic participation. Furthermore, process improvements may yield greater flexibility for women pursuing the challenging field while accommodating other barriers faced by women in orthopaedic surgery.",0

Listening to music during intranasal (es)ketamine therapy in patients with treatment-resistant depression correlates with better tolerability and reduced anxiety.,"BACKGROUND: Although the effectiveness of (es)ketamine for therapy-resistant depression (TRD) has been established, potential treatment-limiting factors include side effects like dissociation, anxiety, or elevated blood pressure. Music can reduce stress and negative emotions as anxiety. This study aimed to investigate the impact of listening to music during intranasal (es)ketamine administration on both tolerability and efficacy. METHODS: Records of 494 sessions (of 37 patients) with intranasal (es)ketamine administration, each containing data of blood pressure measurements, DSS-IV (dissociation symptoms scale-IV), anxiety and euphoria analogue scale, MADRS (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale) and BDI (Beck's Depression Inventory) were evaluated. RESULTS: The between-group analysis, comparing participants who listened to music with those who did not, revealed significant differences in the administered dose (p-value: 0.003, mean: 131.5 mg with music vs. 116.7 mg without music), scores on the DSS Item 1 (p-value: 0.005, mean: 3 points vs. 2.4 points), levels of anxiety (p-value: <0.001, mean: 0.4 points vs. 1.4 points), and measurements of maximal systolic blood pressure after administration (p-value: 0.017, mean: 137.9 mmHg vs. 140.3 mmHg). Listening to music had no impact on the MARDS-change score between the sessions. LIMITATIONS: Key limitations include a non-randomized naturalistic design and the non-standardized selection of music, which was based on individual patient preferences. CONCLUSION: Listening to music during intranasal (es)ketamine therapy appears to be linked to reduced anxiety and lower blood pressure, stable or increased dissociation levels, and improved tolerance for higher doses. These findings could potentially contribute to the optimization of (es)ketamine therapy, both in terms of treatment efficacy and managing side effects.",0
Materials and manufacturing techniques for occlusal splints: A literature review.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the materials and fabrications methods of occlusal splints with their advantages and shortcomings and to clarify the indications for each. BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) encompass a range of conditions affecting the masticatory system. Occlusal splints are currently recognised as a viable option for the management of TMDs when they are adopted in conjunction with additional approaches varying from conservative procedures (counselling, biofeedback, physical therapy, pharmacotherapy) to irreversible and less conservative ones (occlusal adjustments, orthodontics, arthroscopy and surgery). These splints can vary in design, function and material. The components used to fabricate the splints must withstand occlusal forces, be aesthetically pleasing, comfortable and minimally interfering with function and phonetics. Traditional methods for fabricating splints include sprinkle-on, thermoforming and lost wax techniques. However, with the advancement of CAD/CAM technology, additive (3D printing) and subtractive (milling) manufacturing methods expand the range of possibilities by introducing novel solutions for elaborating splints. METHODS: An electronic search was conducted on PubMed using the following keywords: ""occlusal splint"", ""guard and ""materials"", and ""manufacturing."" Thirteen in vitro publications were screened and they consisted of four clinical studies, nine reviews (three of them were systematic reviews), and five case reports. CONCLUSION: The choice of material is crucial for the success of splint therapy. Factors such as biocompatibility, ease of fabrication, adjustability, cost and patient preference should be considered. Newer materials and techniques are emerging because of advancements in material science and manufacturing techniques. However, it should be noted that most of the evidence is based on in vitro studies with different methodologies, limiting their validity in daily practice.",0
A practical proposal on treatment sequencing of metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours.,"According to the neuroendocrine tumour (NET) characteristics, 3 to 7 different treatment options are available, corresponding to 6 to 5,040 theoretical different sequences. Even though each patient is unique and despite a large heterogeneity in NET characteristics, the present review aims to discuss the main sequences and addresses how one can propose the best sequence to treat metastatic NET (mNET) on a case-by-case basis. Each treatment must be discussed during dedicated multi-disciplinary meetings, and inclusions in clinical trials should be favoured. After a thorough characterization of patients and their mNET, and taking into account the availability of drugs, the first-line treatment should be chosen according to the treatment aim. The latter is determined based on three main topics (efficacy, safety, and patient preferences) that do not necessarily converge and must be defined a priori. At baseline, physicians should design an a priori full therapeutic sequence, which may evolve at each step depending on the response to previous treatment, the occurrence of chronic toxicities, and the patients' perception of the prior treatment. To improve knowledge in terms of effectiveness and risk of cumulative toxicities regarding the different sequences, real-world data using long follow-up durations are necessary; such issues will not be resolved by randomized clinical trials.",0

A Narrative Review of Advancements in Understanding and Treating Varicose Veins.,"Chronic venous disease, with varicose veins as its archetypal manifestation, stands as a pervasive and intricate health quandary, encompassing a vast array of contributing factors. Age, genetics, obesity, pregnancy, and prolonged immobility weave a complex tapestry, underscoring the omnipresence of this ailment. Its societal and economic footprint is undeniably formidable, as diverse classifications underscore its multifaceted character. The intricate interplay of chronic venous disease with diabetes mellitus and neuropathy compounds the challenge, fostering soaring healthcare expenditures and a palpable erosion of quality of life, particularly among women harboring cardiometabolic risk factors. Despite research shedding light on heightened susceptibility within certain demographics, the enigmatic determinants orchestrating the transition from mild to severe chronic venous disease continue to elude us. Varicose veins, marked by the presence of dilated and tortuous subcutaneous vessels, precipitate both physical discomfort and cosmetic concerns, frequently necessitating meticulous clinical evaluation coupled with ultrasound studies to secure a precise diagnosis. Treatment strategies are strategically crafted to ameliorate distressing symptoms, enhance aesthetic concerns, and forestall potential complications. Nevertheless, the prognostication of chronic venous disease remains ensconced in a degree of ambiguity, hinting at the vast terrain yet to be charted in this medical domain. The quest to fathom the intricacies of this condition uncovers an ever-evolving panorama where conservative interventions play an indispensable role in managing mild cases, while interventional procedures like endovenous laser ablation and sclerotherapy step onto the stage for patients grappling with severe symptoms, thus treading the fine line between efficacy and invasiveness. Moreover, a meticulous economic analysis underscores the cost-effectiveness of various therapeutic modalities, thereby bolstering the imperative of a patient-centered approach. As we navigate the labyrinthine complexities of chronic venous disease and varicose vein management, we are inexorably drawn to the pivotal role of customized treatment approaches, as well as the dynamic interplay between scientific progress, patient preferences, and therapeutic innovations in the relentless pursuit of optimized outcomes and an enhanced quality of life.",0
It takes more than a machine: A pilot feasibility study of point-of-care HIV-1 viral load testing at a lower-level health center in rural western Uganda.,"Barriers continue to limit access to viral load (VL) monitoring across sub-Saharan Africa adversely impacting control of the HIV epidemic. The objective of this study was to determine whether the systems and processes required to realize the potential of rapid molecular technology are available at a prototypical lower-level (i.e., level III) health center in rural Uganda. In this open-label pilot study, participants underwent parallel VL testing at both the central laboratory (i.e., standard of care) and on-site using the GeneXpert HIV-1 assay. The primary outcome was the number of VL tests completed each clinic day. Secondary outcomes included the number of days from sample collection to receipt of result at clinic and the number of days from sample collection to patient receipt of the result. From August 2020 to July 2021, we enrolled a total of 242 participants. The median number of daily tests performed on the Xpert platform was 4, (IQR = 2-7). Time from sample collection to result was 51 days (IQR = 45-62) for samples sent to the central laboratory and 0 days (IQR = 0-0.25) for the Xpert assay conducted at the health center. However, few participants elected to receive results by one of the expedited options, which contributed to similar time-to-patient between testing approaches (89 versus 84 days, p = 0.07). Implementation of a rapid, near point-of-care VL assay at a lower-level health center in rural Uganda appears feasible, but interventions to promote rapid clinical response and influence patient preferences about result receipt require further study.

Antidepressants or running therapy: Comparing effects on mental and physical health in patients with depression and anxiety disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Antidepressant medication and running therapy are both effective treatments for patients with depressive and anxiety disorders. However, they may work through different pathophysiological mechanisms and could differ in their impact on physical health. This study examined effects of antidepressants versus running therapy on both mental and physical health. METHODS: According to a partially randomized patient preference design, 141 patients with depression and/or anxiety disorder were randomized or offered preferred 16-week treatment: antidepressant medication (escitalopram or sertraline) or group-based running therapy ≥2 per week. Baseline (T0) and post-treatment assessment at week 16 (T16) included mental (diagnosis status and symptom severity) and physical health indicators (metabolic and immune indicators, heart rate (variability), weight, lung function, hand grip strength, fitness). RESULTS: Of the 141 participants (mean age 38.2 years; 58.2 % female), 45 participants received antidepressant medication and 96 underwent running therapy. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that remission rates at T16 were comparable (antidepressants: 44.8 %; running: 43.3 %; p = .881). However, the groups differed significantly on various changes in physical health: weight (d = 0.57; p = .001), waist circumference (d = 0.44; p = .011), systolic (d = 0.45; p = .011) and diastolic (d = 0.53; p = .002) blood pressure, heart rate (d = 0.36; p = .033) and heart rate variability (d = 0.48; p = .006). LIMITATIONS: A minority of the participants was willing to be randomized; the running therapy was larger due to greater preference for this intervention. CONCLUSIONS: While the interventions had comparable effects on mental health, running therapy outperformed antidepressants on physical health, due to both larger improvements in the running therapy group as well as larger deterioration in the antidepressant group.

Comparing the Long-Term Success Rates of Tooth Preservation and Dental Implants: A Critical Review.,"Implant therapy is considered a predictable, safe, and reliable rehabilitation method for edentulous patients in most clinical scenarios. Thus, there is a growing trend in the indications for implants, which seems attributable not only to their clinical success but also to arguments such as a more ""simplified approach"" based on convenience or the belief that dental implants are as good as natural teeth. Therefore, the objective of this critical literature review of observational studies was to discuss the evidence concerning the long-term survival rates and treatment outcomes, comparing endodontically or periodontally treated teeth with dental implants. Altogether, the evidence suggests that the decision between keeping a tooth or replacing it with an implant should carefully consider the condition of the tooth (e.g., amount of remaining tooth and degree of attachment loss and mobility), systemic disorders, and patient preference. Although observational studies revealed high success rates and long-term survival of dental implants, failures and complications are common. For this reason, attempts should be made to first save maintainable teeth over the long-term, instead of immediately replacing teeth with dental implants.",0
Gaps in Patient-Centered Decision-Making Related to Complex Surgery: A Mixed-Methods Study.,"INTRODUCTION: We sought to understand the perceptions of surgeons around patient preferred roles in decision-making and their approaches to patient-centered decision-making (PCDM). METHODS: A concurrent embedded mixed-methods design was utilized among a cohort of surgeons performing complex surgical procedures. Data were collected through online surveys. Associations between perceptions and PCDM approaches were examined. RESULTS: Among 241 participants, most respondents were male (67.2%) with an average age of 47.6 y (standard deviation = 10.3); roughly half (52.4%) had practiced medicine for 10 or more years. Surgeons most frequently agreed (94.2%) with the statement, ""Patients prefer to make health decisions on their own after seriously considering their physician's opinion."" Conversely, surgeons most frequently disagreed (73.0%) with the statement, ""Patients prefer that their physician make health decisions for them."" Nearly one-third (30.4%) of surgeon qualitative responses (n = 115) indicated that clinical/biological information would help them tailor their approach to PCDM. Only 12.2% of respondents indicated that they assess patient preferences regarding both decision-making and information needs. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons most frequently agree that patients want to make their own health decisions after seriously considering their physicians opinion. A greater focus on what information surgeons should know before treatment decision-making may help optimize patient experience and outcomes related to complex surgical procedures.",0
Patient-centered care in von Willebrand disease: are we there yet?,"INTRODUCTION: Von Willebrand Disease is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. Paradoxically, affected individuals are often misdiagnosed and experience substantial diagnostic delay. There are sex-specific health disparities in VWD rooted in the stigmatization of vaginal bleeding, which leads to symptom dismissal, lack of timely access to care and lower health-related quality of life. AREAS COVERED: Following the core elements of patient-centered care - respect for patient preferences, values, and needs, we describe the current state of VWD care. Challenges of diagnostic delay, serial misrecognition of abnormal bleeding, and symptom dismissal are barriers that disproportionately affect women with VWD. These negative effects are further amplified in individuals living in low- and middle-income countries. We describe the importance of coordinated multidisciplinary care, as well as the need for patient education and empowered self-advocacy. EXPERT OPINION: While tremendous work has been done to improve the diagnosis and management of VWD, timely and high-quality research is urgently needed to address care gaps. Systemic changes such as resource investment, dedicated research funding for novel treatment modalities, and effective knowledge translation strategies to address structural barriers are needed to facilitate effective patient-centered care for VWD.",0
Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy for the Treatment of Primary and Metastatic Brain Tumors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive treatment option for intracranial tumors that are challenging to treat via traditional methods; however, its safety and efficacy are not yet well validated in the literature. The objectives of the study were to assess the available evidence of the indications and adverse events (AEs) of LITT and 1-year progression-free survival and 1-year overall survival in the treatment of primary and secondary brain tumors. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted through the databases PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library until October 2021. Comparative and descriptive studies, except for case reports, were included in the meta-analysis. Separate analyses by tumor type (high-grade gliomas, including World Health Organization grade 4 astrocytomas [which include glioblastomas] as a specific subgroup; low-grade gliomas; and brain metastases) were conducted. Pooled effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were generated via random-effects models. RESULTS: Forty-five studies met the inclusion criteria, yielding 826 patients for meta-analysis. There were 829 lesions in total, of which 361 were classified as high-grade gliomas, 116 as low-grade gliomas, 337 as metastatic brain tumors, and 15 as nonglial tumors. Indications for offering LITT included deep/inaccessible tumor (12 studies), salvage therapy after failed radiosurgery (9), failures of ≥2 treatment options (3), in pediatric patients (4), patient preference (1); indications were nonspecific in 12 studies. Pooled incidence of all (minor or major) procedure-related AEs was 30% (95% CI, 27%-40%) for all tumors. Pooled incidence of neurologic deficits (minor or major) was 16% (12%-22%); postprocedural edema 14% (8%-22%); seizure 6% (4%-9%); hematoma 20% (14%-29%); deep vein thrombosis 19% (11%-30%); hydrocephalus 8% (5%-12%); and wound infection 5% (3%-7%). One-year progression-free survival was 18.6% (11.3%-29.0%) in high-grade gliomas, 16.9% (11.6%-24.0%) among the grade 4 astrocytomas; and 51.2% (36.7%-65.5%) in brain metastases. One-year overall survival was 43.0% (36.0%-50.0%) in high-grade glioma, 45.9% (95% CI, 37.9%-54%) in grade 4 astrocytomas; 93.0% (42.3%-100%) in low-grade gliomas, and 56.3% (47.0%-65.3%) in brain metastases. CONCLUSIONS: New neurologic deficits and postprocedural edema were the most reported AEs after LITT, albeit mostly transient. This meta-analysis provides the best statistical estimates of progression and survival outcomes based on the available information. LITT is generally a safe procedure for selected patients, and future well-designed comparative studies on its outcomes versus the current standard of care should be performed.",0
Perioperative complications following open or endovascular revascularization for chronic limb-threatening ischemia in the BEST-CLI Trial.,"OBJECTIVE: Anticipated perioperative morbidity is an important factor for choosing a revascularization method for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). Our goal was to assess systemic perioperative complications of patients treated with surgical and endovascular revascularization in the Best Endovascular vs Best Surgical Therapy in Patients with CLTI (BEST-CLI) trial. METHODS: BEST-CLI was a prospective randomized trial comparing open (OPEN) and endovascular (ENDO) revascularization strategies for patients with CLTI. Two parallel cohorts were studied: Cohort 1 included patients with adequate single-segment great saphenous vein (SSGSV), whereas Cohort 2 included those without SSGSV. Data were queried for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE-composite myocardial infarction, stroke, death), non-serious (non-SAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) (criteria-death/life-threatening/requiring hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization/significant disability/incapacitation/affecting subject safety in trial) 30 days after the procedure. Per protocol analysis was used (intervention received without crossover), and risk-adjusted analysis was performed. RESULTS: There were 1367 patients (662 OPEN, 705 ENDO) in Cohort 1 and 379 patients (188 OPEN, 191 ENDO) in Cohort 2. Thirty-day mortality in Cohort 1 was 1.5% (OPEN 1.8%; ENDO 1.3%) and in Cohort 2 was 1.3% (2.7% OPEN; 0% ENDO). MACE in Cohort 1 was 4.7% for OPEN vs 3.13% for ENDO (P = .14), and in Cohort 2, was 4.28% for OPEN and 1.05% for ENDO (P = .15). On risk-adjusted analysis, there was no difference in 30-day MACE for OPEN vs ENDO for Cohort 1 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-2.64; P = .16) or Cohort 2 (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 0.48-9.88; P = .31). The incidence of acute renal failure was similar across interventions; in Cohort 1 it was 3.6% for OPEN vs 2.1% for ENDO (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.85-3.12; P = .14), and in Cohort 2, it was 4.2% OPEN vs 1.6% ENDO (HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 0.75-10.8; P = .12). The occurrence of venous thromboembolism was low overall and was similar between groups in Cohort 1 (OPEN 0.9%; ENDO 0.4%) and Cohort 2 (OPEN 0.5%; ENDO 0%). Rates of any non-SAEs in Cohort 1 were 23.4% in OPEN and 17.9% in ENDO (P = .013); in Cohort 2, they were 21.8% for OPEN and 19.9% for ENDO (P = .7). Rates for any SAEs in Cohort 1 were 35.3% for OPEN and 31.6% for ENDO (P = .15); in Cohort 2, they were 25.5% for OPEN and 23.6% for ENDO (P = .72). The most common types of non-SAEs and SAEs were infection, procedural complications, and cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS: In BEST-CLI, patients with CLTI who were deemed suitable candidates for open lower extremity bypass surgery had similar peri-procedural complications following either OPEN or ENDO revascularization: In such patients, concern about risk of peri-procedure complications should not be a deterrent in deciding revascularization strategy. Rather, other factors, including effectiveness in restoring perfusion and patient preference, are more relevant.",0
Exploration of patients' preference for modalities of care among peritoneal dialysis patients in Singapore: a single-center experience.,"INTRODUCTION: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is home-based dialysis therapy and therefore a suitable modality for kidney failure patients, particularly, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study examined patients' preferences for different PD-related services. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey study. Anonymized data from PD patients followed up at a single center in Singapore were collected using an online platform. The study focused on telehealth services, home visits, and monitoring of quality-of-life (QoL). RESULTS: A total of 78 PD patients responded to the survey. The majority of participants were Chinese (76%), married (73%), and between 45 and 65 years old (45%). The in-person visit was preferred over teleconsultation for consultation with nephrologists (68% versus 32%), counseling for kidney disease and dialysis by renal coordinators (59%), whereas the telehealth service was favored over in-person visit for dietary counseling (60%) and medication counseling (64%). Most participants (81%) preferred medication delivery over self-collection, and the acceptable turnaround time was 1 week. Sixty percent would like to have a regular home visit, but 23% refused such visits. The preferred frequency of home visits was one-to-three visits within the first 6 months (74%) and then 6 monthly for subsequent visits (40%). The majority of participants (87%) agreed with QoL monitoring, and the preferred frequency of monitoring varied between 6 monthly (45%) and yearly (40%). Participants also indicated three key areas in research to improve QoL, such as the development of artificial kidneys, portable PD devices, and simplification of PD procedure. Participants also would like to see improvement in two main areas of PD services, such as delivery service for PD solutions and social (instrumental, informational, and emotional) support. CONCLUSIONS: Most PD patients preferred in-person visits with nephrologists or renal coordinators; however, they favored telehealth services with dieticians and pharmacists. PD patients also welcomed home visit service and QoL monitoring. Future studies should confirm these findings.",0
Patient preferences and cost-benefit of hypertension and hyperlipidemia collaborative management model between pharmacies and primary care in Portugal: A discrete choice experiment alongside a trial (USFarmácia®).,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about patient preferences and the value of pharmacy-collaborative disease management with primary care using technology-driven interprofessional communication under real-world conditions. Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) are useful for quantifying preferences for non-market services. OBJECTIVES: 1) To explore variation in patient preferences and estimate willingness-to-accept annual cost to the National Health Service (NHS) for attributes of a collaborative intervention trial between pharmacies and primary care using a trial exit DCE interview; 2) to incorporate a DCE into an economic evaluation using cost-benefit analysis (CBA). METHODS: We performed a DCE telephone interview with a sample of hypertension and hyperlipidemia trial patients 12 months after trial onset. We used five attributes (levels): waiting time to get urgent/not urgent medical appointment (7 days/45 days; 48 hrs./30 days; same day/15 days), model of pharmacy intervention (5-min. counter basic check; 15-min. office every 3 months for BP and medication review of selected medicines; 30-min. office every 6 months for comprehensive measurements and medication review of all medicines), integration with primary care (weak; partial; full), chance of having a stroke in 5 years (same; slightly lower; much lower), and annual cost to the NHS (0€; 30€; 51€; 76€). We used an experimental orthogonal fractional factorial design. Data were analyzed using conditional logit. We subtracted the estimated annual incremental trial costs from the mean WTA (Net Benefit) for CBA. RESULTS: A total of 122 patients completed the survey. Waiting time to get medical appointment-on the same day (urgent) and within 15 days (non-urgent)-was the most important attribute, followed by 30-minute pharmacy intervention in private office every 6 months for point-of-care measurements and medication review of all medicines, and full integration with primary care. The cost attribute was not significant. Intervention patients were willing to accept the NHS annual cost of €877 for their preferred scenario. The annual net benefit per patient is €788.20 and represents the monetary value of patients' welfare surplus for this model. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first conducted in Portugal alongside a pharmacy collaborative trial, incorporating DCE into CBA. The findings can be used to guide the design of pharmacy collaborative interventions with primary care with the potential for reimbursement for uncontrolled or at-risk chronic disease patients informed by patient preferences. Future DCE studies conducted in community pharmacy may provide additional contributions.

Risk Stratification of Cardiovascular Disease according to Age Groups in New Prevention Guidelines: A Review.,"Age is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, most cardiovascular risk prediction models have included age as an independent risk factor. There is much evidence that effective management of cardiovascular risk factors improves clinical outcomes even in older adults. However, there are concerns that intensive treatment for older adults increases the risk of adverse events. For hypertensive patients, intensive blood pressure reduction with combination therapy increases the risk of syncope, acute kidney injury, and falls. Intensive glucose-lowering therapy among older patients with diabetes increases the risk of hypoglycemia or cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that a balanced approach for older adults is required to increase the benefits and decrease the risk of side effects. In contrast to older people, the estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk in young and healthy individuals is low. However, the lifetime cardiovascular risk in these patients is actually high. The 2021 European Society of Cardiology guideline on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice has been published. It proposed a different risk stratification and recommendation for treatment according to age group, based on the concept of avoiding undertreatment in young people and overtreatment in older persons. Although the guideline recommends age-dependent risk stratification, risk categories should not be applied to the mandatory initiation of drug treatment. In all age groups, other factors such as lifetime cardiovascular risk, treatment benefit and harm, comorbidities, frailty, and patient preferences should be considered when managing patients for primary prevention.",0
Avelumab treatment for patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma can be safely stopped after 1 year and a PET/CT-confirmed complete response.,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) has shown high response rates, ranging from 33% to 73%. The ideal duration of treatment, however, is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate if avelumab treatment for mMCC can be safely stopped after 1 year of treatment and a complete response (CR) confirmed by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) imaging. METHODS: Patients who received more than one dose of avelumab treatment for mMCC between November 2017 and February 2022 were included in this study. Treatment was discontinued in case of a FDG-PET/CT confirmed CR after 1 year (26 cycles) of avelumab or a CR and unacceptable toxicity earlier. The primary end point was recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were included: 25 (38%) had a FDG-PET/CT-confirmed CR at discontinuation of avelumab. In those 25 patients, reasons for discontinuation of treatment were completion of 1 year of treatment in 13 (52%), toxicity in five (20%), and patient preference in seven (28%). Median duration of treatment in this group was 11 months (interquartile range, 6.1-11.7). Median follow-up was 27 months (interquartile range, 15.8-33.8). The 12-month RFS was 88% (95% CI, 0.74-1) and median RFS was not reached. Two patients (8%) had a recurrence at 4 and 7 months after discontinuation of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mMCC who acquire a CR on PET/CT imaging appear to have durable responses after discontinuation of treatment after 1 year.",0
Early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy in patients with cancer who have low-risk neutropenic sepsis: the EASI-SWITCH RCT.,"BACKGROUND: Neutropenic sepsis is a common complication of systemic anticancer treatment. There is variation in practice in timing of switch to oral antibiotics after commencement of empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy. OBJECTIVES: To establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of early switch to oral antibiotics in patients with neutropenic sepsis at low risk of infective complications. DESIGN: A randomised, multicentre, open-label, allocation concealed, non-inferiority trial to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of early oral switch in comparison to standard care. SETTING: Nineteen UK oncology centres. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 16 years and over receiving systemic anticancer therapy with fever (≥ 38°C), or symptoms and signs of sepsis, and neutropenia (≤ 1.0 × 10(9)/l) within 24 hours of randomisation, with a Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer score of ≥ 21 and receiving intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam or meropenem for < 24 hours were eligible. Patients with acute leukaemia or stem cell transplant were excluded. INTERVENTION: Early switch to oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice daily) and co-amoxiclav (625 mg three times daily) within 12-24 hours of starting intravenous antibiotics to complete 5 days treatment in total. Control was standard care, that is, continuation of intravenous antibiotics for at least 48 hours with ongoing treatment at physician discretion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment failure, a composite measure assessed at day 14 based on the following criteria: fever persistence or recurrence within 72 hours of starting intravenous antibiotics; escalation from protocolised antibiotics; critical care support or death. RESULTS: The study was closed early due to under-recruitment with 129 patients recruited; hence, a definitive conclusion regarding non-inferiority cannot be made. Sixty-five patients were randomised to the early switch arm and 64 to the standard care arm with subsequent intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses including 125 (intervention n = 61 and control n = 64) and 113 (intervention n = 53 and control n = 60) patients, respectively. In the intention-to-treat population the treatment failure rates were 14.1% in the control group and 24.6% in the intervention group, difference = 10.5% (95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.22). In the per-protocol population the treatment failure rates were 13.3% and 17.7% in control and intervention groups, respectively; difference = 3.7% (95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.148). Treatment failure predominantly consisted of persistence or recurrence of fever and/or physician-directed escalation from protocolised antibiotics with no critical care admissions or deaths. The median length of stay was shorter in the intervention group and adverse events reported were similar in both groups. Patients, particularly those with care-giving responsibilities, expressed a preference for early switch. However, differences in health-related quality of life and health resource use were small and not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Non-inferiority for early oral switch could not be proven due to trial under-recruitment. The findings suggest this may be an acceptable treatment strategy for some patients who can adhere to such a treatment regimen and would prefer a potentially reduced duration of hospitalisation while accepting increased risk of treatment failure resulting in re-admission. Further research should explore tools for patient stratification for low-risk de-escalation or ambulatory pathways including use of biomarkers and/or point-of-care rapid microbiological testing as an adjunct to clinical decision-making tools. This could include application to shorter-duration antimicrobial therapy in line with other antimicrobial stewardship studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered as ISRCTN84288963.

Patient Preferences in Short-Interval Staged Bilateral Rotator Cuff Repair.,"The decision to seek and undergo treatment for bilateral rotator cuff tears is often complex. The purpose of this study was to investigate patient preferences for undergoing short-interval staged bilateral rotator cuff repair; timing of surgeries; and order of surgeries. A retrospective analysis was performed for patients who underwent bilateral arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs within 12 months at a single institution. Postoperative patient-reported outcomes, satisfaction, and decision-making factors were collected via REDCap surveys. Ninety patients were included (63 men and 27 women; mean age, 58.1 years). The mean time between surgeries was 7.33 months. Forty-two percent of patients had left rotator cuff repair first. Patients reported a mean satisfaction score of 91.6 of 100 with the order of the surgeries and 87.3 of 100 with the timing of the surgeries. Mean postoperative American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons standardized assessment scores were 94.6 and 93.7 (left vs right shoulder first, respectively) for left shoulders and 94.2 and 93.9 (left vs right shoulder first, respectively) for right shoulders. Mean postoperative Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation scores were 86.5 and 83.9 (left vs right shoulder first, respectively) for left shoulders and 87.3 and 86.0 (left vs right shoulder first, respectively) for right shoulders. Decision-making factors noted as highly important included night pain, function, surgeon recommendation, and daily pain. Most patients who undergo short-interval staged bilateral rotator cuff repair are satisfied with the order and timing of their surgery. Decision-making factors such as night pain and functional limitation play a key role in the timing and order of bilateral rotator cuff repairs. [Orthopedics. 2023;46(6):e347-e352.].",0
Functional status and therapy for older adults with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in nursing homes: A population-based study.,"OBJECTIVES: To characterize the prevalence of functional and cognitive impairments, and associations between impairments and treatment among older patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) receiving nursing home (NH) care. METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database to identify beneficiaries diagnosed with DLBCL 2011-2015 who received care in a NH within -120 ~ +30 days of diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare receipt of chemoimmunotherapy (including multi-agent, anthracycline-containing regimens), 30-day mortality, and hospitalization between NH and community-dwelling patients, estimating odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We also examined overall survival (OS). Among NH patients, we examined receipt of chemoimmunotherapy based on functional and cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Of the eligible 649 NH patients (median age: 82 years), 45% received chemoimmunotherapy; among the recipients, 47% received multi-agent, anthracycline-containing regimens. Compared with community-dwelling patients, those in a NH were less likely to receive chemoimmunotherapy (OR: 0.34, 95%CI: 0.29-0.41), had higher 30-day mortality (OR: 2.00, 95%CI: 1.43-2.78) and hospitalization (OR: 1.51, 95%CI: 1.18-1.93), and poorer OS (hazard ratio: 1.36, 95%CI: 1.11-1.65). NH patients with severe functional (61%) or any cognitive impairment (48%) were less likely to receive chemoimmunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: High rates of functional and cognitive impairment and low rates of chemoimmunotherapy were observed among NH residents diagnosed with DLBCL. Further research is needed to better understand the potential role of novel and alternative treatment strategies and patient preferences for treatment to optimize clinical care and outcomes in this high-risk population.",0
Understanding community-dwelling older adults' preferences for home- and community-based services: A conjoint analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Older adults' preference for home- and community-based service programs has been highlighted as an essential but usually ignored ingredient in current care models. Disentangling how preferences contribute to older adults' decision-making could facilitate finding optimal ways to deliver home- and community-based services in times of increasing scarcity. OBJECTIVE: To identify Chinese community-dwelling older adults' preference structure for home- and community-based services and thus to optimize service provision. METHODS: Conjoint analysis, a preference-based technique, was employed to study older adults' preferences. A stepwise qualitative approach was first adopted to identify the attributes and attribute levels of home- and community-based services. Scenarios were defined through an orthogonal fractional factorial design, and a cross-sectional survey was conducted through a face-to-face, anonymous questionnaire. Conjoint analysis was performed to determine preference weights representing the relative importance of the identified attributes, and cluster analysis was performed to identify clusters of participants with similar preference structures. All data analyses were performed using SAS v9.4 and SPSS 22.0. RESULTS: A total of 321 of 350 invited participants completed the questionnaire. Four attributes were identified and used to create the conjoint scenarios: care-giving attitude, price, technical care-giving skills, and the type of service provider. Care-giving attitude was the most valued attribute for older adults when making decisions (relative importance score = 48.28), followed by price (relative importance score = 21.618), technical care-giving skills (relative importance score = 19.518), and finally, the type of service provider (relative importance score = 10.585). Three preference phenotypes were identified by applying cluster analysis: ""price-oriented"", ""comprehensively balanced"", and ""attitude-oriented"". CONCLUSION: The present study underscored the importance of considering attributes valued by Chinese older adults in the design and delivery of home- and community-based services. The preference structure, including the utility score of the attribute levels, differs among older adults. The findings could inform future research and practice and suggest incorporating flexibility during the service delivery stage.",1
Active surveillance versus treatment in low-risk DCIS: Women's preferences in the LORD-trial.,"BACKGROUND: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) can progress to invasive breast cancer (IBC), but most DCIS lesions remain indolent. However, guidelines recommend surgery, often supplemented by radiotherapy. This implies overtreatment of indolent DCIS. The non-randomised patient preference LORD-trial tests whether active surveillance (AS) for low-risk DCIS is safe, by giving women with low-risk DCIS a choice between AS and conventional treatment (CT). Here, we aim to describe how participants are distributed among both trial arms, identify their motives for their preference, and assess factors associated with their choice. METHODS: Data were extracted from baseline questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the distribution and characteristics of participants; thematic analyses to extract self-reported reasons for the choice of trial arm, and multivariable logistic regression analyses to investigate associations between patient characteristics and chosen trial arm. RESULTS: Of 377 women included, 76% chose AS and 24% CT. Most frequently cited reasons for AS were ""treatment is not (yet) necessary"" (59%) and trust in the AS-plan (39%). Reasons for CT were cancer worry (51%) and perceived certainty (29%). Women opting for AS more often had lower educational levels (OR 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.93) and more often reported experiencing shared decision making (OR 2.71; 95% CI, 1.37-5.37) than women choosing CT. CONCLUSION: The LORD-trial is the first to offer women with low-risk DCIS a choice between CT and AS. Most women opted for AS and reported high levels of trust in the safety of AS. Their preferences highlight the necessity to establish the safety of AS for low-risk DCIS.",0
Learning From Clinical Supervisor Practice Variability: Exploring Medical Resident and Fellow Experiences and Interpretations.,"PURPOSE: Clinical practice variability is characterized by 2 or more clinicians making different treatment decisions despite encountering a similar case. This study explores how medical residents and fellows experience and interpret intersupervisor clinical practice variability and how these variations influence learning. METHOD: Seventeen senior residents or fellows in internal medicine, hematology, or thrombosis medicine (postgraduate year 3 or above) participated in semistructured interviews after a clinical rotation in thrombosis medicine from December 2019 to March 2021. Data collection and analysis occurred iteratively and concurrently in a manner consistent with constructivist grounded theory. Variation theory was used to guide the development of some interview questions. A central tenet of this theory is that learning occurs by experiencing 3 sequential patterns of variation: contrast, generalization, and fusion. Participants were recruited purposively with respect to specialty until theoretical sufficiency was reached. RESULTS: Clinical practice variability was experienced by all participants. Residents and fellows attributed practice variability to intrinsic differences among supervisors; interinstitutional differences; selection and interpretation of evidence; patient preferences, priorities, and fears; and their own participation in the decision-making process. Clinical practice variability helped residents and fellows discern key features of cases that influenced decision-making (contrast), group similar cases so that the appropriate evidence could be applied (generalization), and develop attitudes consistent with providing individualized patient care (fusion). Observing practice variability was more helpful for fifth- and sixth-year residents and less helpful for third- and fourth-year residents. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practice variability helped residents and fellows discern critical aspects, group similar patients, and practice individualized medicine. Future research should characterize how clinical practice variability influences learning across the spectrum of training, how supervisors could encourage learning from practice variability, and how curricula could be modified to allow learners greater opportunity to reflect on and consolidate the practice differences they observe.",0
"""If Not Me, Then Who?"": Exploring the Challenges Experienced by Front-Line Clinicians Screening for, and Communicating About, Domestic Violence in the Emergency Department.","Screening for domestic violence in healthcare settings increases detection. The emergency department (ED) is one setting where victims frequently attend with injuries and illnesses sustained from violence. However, screening rates remain suboptimal. There is little research about how formal screening occurs, or how less structured interactions are negotiated within the ED context. This article explores this important, but non-mandatory procedure within the context of clinician-patient interactions in Australia. A descriptive qualitative study was undertaken with 21 clinicians across seven EDs in Australia. Thematic analysis was undertaken by two researchers. Results indicate a lack of confidence around DV screening, and tensions in clinicians initiating conversation while managing their own emotional stressors. No participants expressed knowledge of formal screening processes in their workplaces. Successful DV screening programs must provide clinicians with the tools to minimize perceived discomfort in initiating and sustaining conversations while accepting patient preferences regarding disclosure.",0
Discharge of Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients on Sub-Optimal Dual Anti-Platelet Therapy: A Single Center Experience.,"PURPOSE: To identify and quantify the reasons why acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing stenting at University of New Mexico Hospital were prescribed sub-optimal dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) at discharge, and to identify practice patterns that could potentially lead to improved DAPT treatment for these patients. METHODS: We reviewed electronic medical records and cardiac catheterization records of 326 patients who underwent PCI at UNMH between January 1, 2021, and June 30, 2022 and identified 229 ACS patients who survived until discharge. Demographic and clinical characteristics relevant to P2Y(12) selection were obtained from a review of medical records. Pharmacists' notes that documented their efforts to get appropriate insurance coverage and reasons for discharge on clopidogrel rather than ticagrelor were reviewed. Patients discharged on aspirin and clopidogrel underwent review of medical records and cardiac catheterization lab records to determine if the discharge P2Y(12) drug was appropriate. Reasons for inappropriately discharge on clopidogrel were categorized as cost/insurance, patient preference, concern for daily adherence to a twice-daily medication, and on clopidogrel before PCI and not switched to ticagrelor afterward. RESULTS: The 229 ACS patients included (38.0%, n = 87) appropriately discharged on ticagrelor/prasugrel, (27.5%, n = 63) appropriately discharged on clopidogrel, (32.8%, n = 75) inappropriately discharged on clopidogrel, and (1.7%, n = 4) not discharged on a P2Y(12) inhibitor. For patients inappropriately discharged on clopidogrel (n = 75), the most common reasons were cost or lack of insurance (n = 56) and clinical inertia (taking clopidogrel before PCI and maintained on it afterward) (n = 17). Inappropriate DAPT at discharge correlated with lack of insurance (90.5% compared to 39.7% in patients with insurance, P < 0.001) but not with ethnicity. CONCLUSION: At the University of New Mexico, a safety-net hospital, increasing financially restricted access to ticagrelor could help up to 24.5% of ACS patients reduce their risk of ischemic events. For patients admitted on clopidogrel DAPT, upgrading to ticagrelor could reduce ischemic risk in 7.4% of ACS patients. Expanding healthcare insurance coverage might redue sub-optimal DAPT coverage.",0
Understanding and preventing nonadherence and treatment dropout in adolescents and young adults with anxiety and depressive disorders.,"Dropout from psychological or pharmacological treatment for anxiety and depressive disorders is common. It is especially problematic in adolescents and young adults because of the adverse consequences for their development. Reasons for treatment dropout can be divided into therapy-process related factors, attitudinal aspects, and practical issues. Adjusting treatment to patient preferences and shared decision making, improving the therapeutic alliance, and interventions such as (family) psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, and help with practical issues are promising strategies to optimize engagement and adherence.",0
New insights into acupuncture techniques for poststroke spasticity.,"With the trend of aging population getting more obvious, stroke has already been a major public health problem worldwide. As a main disabling motor impairment after stroke, spasticity has unexpected negative impacts on the quality of life and social participation in patients. Moreover, it brings heavy economic burden to the family and society. Previous researches indicated that abnormality of neural modulation and muscle property corelates with the pathogenesis of poststroke spasticity (PSS). So far, there still lacks golden standardized treatment regimen for PSS; furthermore, certain potential adverse-events of the mainstream therapy, for example, drug-induced generalized muscle weakness or high risk related surgery somehow decrease patient preference and compliance, which brings challenges to disease treatment and follow-up care. As an essential non-pharmacological therapy, acupuncture has long been used for PSS in China and shows favorable effects on improvements of spastic hypertonia and motor function. Notably, previous studies focused mainly on the research of antispastic acupoints. In comparison, few studies lay special stress on the other significant factor impacting on acupuncture efficacy, that is acupuncture technique. Based on current evidences from the clinic and laboratory, we will discuss certain new insights into acupuncture technique, in particular the antispastic needling technique, for PSS management in light of its potential effects on central modulations as well as peripheral adjustments, and attempt to provide some suggestions for future studies with respect to the intervention timing and course, application of acupuncture techniques, acupoint selection, predictive and aggravating factors of PSS, aiming at optimization of antispastic acupuncture regimen and improvement of quality of life in stroke patients. More innovations including rigorous study design, valid objective assessments for spasticity, and related experimental studies are worthy to be expected in the years ahead.",0
Patient preferences for active ulcerative colitis treatments and fecal microbiota transplantation.,"BACKGROUND: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising treatment for active ulcerative colitis (UC). Understanding patient preferences can identify treatment features that may impact treatment decisions, improve shared decision-making, and contribute to patient-centered care, which is especially important in the context of novel treatments like FMT. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to quantify preferences for active UC treatments, specifically FMT and biologics, and identify patient characteristics associated with different preference patterns. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional survey study. METHODS: We administered a discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey to elicit preferences in a sample of Canadian adults with UC. DCE data were analyzed using a main-effects mixed logit model and used to predict uptake of hypothetical scenarios reflecting alternative combinations of treatment features. Latent class modeling identified heterogeneity in patient preference patterns. RESULTS: Participants' (n = 201) mean age was 47.1 years (SD: 14.5 years), 58% were female, and most (84%) had at least some post-secondary education. Almost half were willing to undergo FMT. When considering treatments for active UC, the most important attributes were chance of remission and severity of rare unknown side effects. All else equal, participants were most likely to uptake treatment that involves oral capsules/pills. Participants in the class with the highest utility for chance of remission were younger, had more severe disease, and 58% indicated that they would be willing to undergo FMT. CONCLUSION: We identified characteristics of UC patients who are more likely to be interested in FMT using preference elicitation methods. Patient-centered care can be enhanced by knowing which patients are more likely to be interested in FMT, potentially improving satisfaction with and adherence to treatments for active UC to maximize the effectiveness of treatment while considering heterogeneity in patient preferences.",1
2022 Joint ESC/EACTS review of the 2018 guideline recommendations on the revascularization of left main coronary artery disease in patients at low surgical risk and anatomy suitable for PCI or CABG.,"In October 2021, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) jointly agreed to establish a Task Force (TF) to review recommendations of the 2018 ESC/EACTS Guidelines on myocardial revascularization as they apply to patients with left main (LM) disease with low-to-intermediate SYNTAX score (0-32). This followed the withdrawal of support by the EACTS in 2019 for the recommendations about the management of LM disease of the previous guideline. The TF was asked to review all new relevant data since the 2018 guidelines including updated aggregated data from the four randomized trials comparing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents vs. coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with LM disease. This document represents a summary of the work of the TF; suggested updated recommendations for the choice of revascularization modality in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization for LM disease are included. In stable patients with an indication for revascularization for LM disease, with coronary anatomy suitable for both procedures and a low predicted surgical mortality, the TF concludes that both treatment options are clinically reasonable based on patient preference, available expertise, and local operator volumes. The suggested recommendations for revascularization with CABG are Class I, Level of Evidence A. The recommendations for PCI are Class IIa, Level of Evidence A. The TF recognized several important gaps in knowledge related to revascularization in patients with LM disease and recognizes that aggregated data from the four randomized trials were still only large enough to exclude large differences in mortality.",0
Building an implementation framework to address unmet contraceptive care needs in a carceral setting: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: The provision of contraceptive care for incarcerated individuals has been largely inconsistent and has contributed to, at best, inadequate care, and at worst reproductive abuses, violence, and coercion. While previous research has identified strategies to remedy known issues, to date, very few recommendations have been implemented across the carceral system. To address this, we conducted a systematic review of policy and practice recommendations to improve contraceptive care to reproductive-aged, incarcerated individuals in the United States. METHODS: We conducted this systematic review utilizing the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and framed it within the National Implementation Research Network's (NIRN) Exploration stage. We searched PubMed, PSYCInfo, SCOPUS, ProQuest, Web of Science, MedLine, Social Science Citation Index and reference sections of included materials. Basic study information, explicitly stated policy and practice recommendations, and discussions and conclusions that subtly provide recommendations were extracted in full text. We utilized a thematic analysis approach to analyze the extracted text. RESULTS: A total of 45 materials met the inclusion criteria. Seven overarching themes were identified: 1) policy changes needed to implement care; 2) need for contraceptive care in carceral systems; 3) justice agency barriers regarding contraceptive care provision; 4) policy barriers to contraceptive access; 5) funding strategies to improve care; 6) patient preferences for contraceptive care delivery; and 7) healthcare provider knowledge regarding contraceptive care. The seven themes identified shed light on the need for, gaps, barriers, and facilitators of current contraceptive care provision to incarcerated individuals. CONCLUSION: This systematic review accomplished two goals of NIRN's Exploration stage. First, the compiled evidence identified a clear need for change regarding policies and practices pertaining to contraceptive care provision to incarcerated individuals in the United States. Second, our findings identified several evidence-based solutions supported both by research and professional healthcare organizations to address the identified need for change. This study provides an initial blueprint for correctional agencies to implement the necessary changes for improving contraceptive care provision to incarcerated populations. The correctional system is in a unique position to deliver much-needed care, which would result in many potential benefits to the individuals, correctional system, and community at large.",0
Patient and Healthcare Professional Preferences for Prescription Weight Loss Medications in Australia: Two Discrete Choice Experiments.,"PURPOSE: Overweight and obesity are common in Australia and among the leading risk factors for ill health. Maintained weight loss of >5-10% can prevent and reduce the risk of obesity-related comorbidities. Prescription weight loss medications plus lifestyle interventions can result in additional weight loss compared with lifestyle interventions alone, but these medications are under-prescribed in Australia. Our aim was to develop a greater understanding of the treatment preferences of people with overweight or obesity and the healthcare practitioners (HCPs) who treat them. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: An online survey of Australian adults with overweight or obesity and treating HCPs was conducted in 2020. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) approach was used to determine what is most important to people when evaluating oral and injectable prescription weight loss medications. Participants were asked to choose between three hypothetical treatment alternatives: ""Oral pill""; ""Subcutaneous injection pen (replaceable needle)""; ""Disposable subcutaneous injection pen (hidden needle)""; and an opt-out option (""None of these""). RESULTS: The online survey and DCE were completed by 193 patients and 104 HCPs. For both patients and HCPs, all treatment alternatives (oral, replaceable injection and disposable injection) were preferred over the opt-out. Gastrointestinal side effects, followed by success rate, percentage body weight lost, and cost were the most important attributes to patients. For HCPs, percentage body weight loss was the most important treatment attribute, followed by success rate, gastrointestinal side effects and cost. While most patients reported relatively low needle fear, physicians reported relatively high perceived patient needle fear. CONCLUSION: Clinician-patient discussions about treatments for weight loss should cover the option of prescription weight loss medications, including injectable medications, which patients may be less apprehensive about than physicians believe. Treatments with a high success rate and low or manageable risk of gastrointestinal side effects may be preferred over alternatives.",1
Merging machine learning and patient preference: a novel tool for risk prediction of percutaneous coronary interventions.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Predicting personalized risk for adverse events following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains critical in weighing treatment options, employing risk mitigation strategies, and enhancing shared decision-making. This study aimed to employ machine learning models using pre-procedural variables to accurately predict common post-PCI complications. METHODS: A group of 66 adults underwent a semiquantitative survey assessing a preferred list of outcomes and model display. The machine learning cohort included 107 793 patients undergoing PCI procedures performed at 48 hospitals in Michigan between 1 April 2018 and 31 December 2021 in the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Cardiovascular Consortium (BMC2) registry separated into training and validation cohorts. External validation was conducted in the Cardiac Care Outcomes Assessment Program database of 56 583 procedures in 33 hospitals in Washington. RESULTS: Overall rate of in-hospital mortality was 1.85% (n = 1999), acute kidney injury 2.51% (n = 2519), new-onset dialysis 0.44% (n = 462), stroke 0.41% (n = 447), major bleeding 0.89% (n = 942), and transfusion 2.41% (n = 2592). The model demonstrated robust discrimination and calibration for mortality {area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.930 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.920-0.940]}, acute kidney injury [AUC: 0.893 (95% CI 0.883-0.903)], dialysis [AUC: 0.951 (95% CI 0.939-0.964)], stroke [AUC: 0.751 (95%CI 0.714-0.787)], transfusion [AUC: 0.917 (95% CI 0.907-0.925)], and major bleeding [AUC: 0.887 (95% CI 0.870-0.905)]. Similar discrimination was noted in the external validation population. Survey subjects preferred a comprehensive list of individually reported post-procedure outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Using common pre-procedural risk factors, the BMC2 machine learning models accurately predict post-PCI outcomes. Utilizing patient feedback, the BMC2 models employ a patient-centred tool to clearly display risks to patients and providers (https://shiny.bmc2.org/pci-prediction/). Enhanced risk prediction prior to PCI could help inform treatment selection and shared decision-making discussions.",0

Advancing precision oncology through systematic germline and tumor genetic analysis: The oncogenetic point of view on findings from a prospective multicenter clinical trial of 666 patients.,"INTRODUCTION: With the emergence of targeted therapies, there is a need to accurately identify more tumor biomarkers. The EXOMA trial was designed to offer tumor and germline exome sequencing (ES) to patients with solid malignant tumors and facing therapeutic failure. As hereditary cancer predispositions could be identified, with genetic counseling and health management implications, a genetic consultation was systematically established. This design needs to be discussed as genetic human resources are limited and indication of theranostic tests will increase. METHODS: Genetic counseling was conducted within 15 days following inclusion in the study for patients recruited between December 2015 and July 2019. In silico analyses from theranostic ES were limited to 317 genes involved in oncogenesis, from both tumor and blood DNA. RESULTS: Six hundred and sixty six patients had a genetic consultation before ES. In 65/666 patients, 66 germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants were identified in 16 actionable genes and seven non-actionable genes according to French guidelines. 24/65 patients had previously received genetic analysis for diagnostic purposes, and for 17 of them, a P/LP variant had already been identified. Among the 48/65 remaining cases for which the EXOMA protocol revealed a previously unknown P/LP variant, only 19 met the criteria for genetic testing for inherited cancer risk after familial survey. These criteria had not been identified by the oncologist in 10 cases. In 21/65 cases, the variant was considered incidental. DISCUSSION: In 7.4% of patients, an undiagnosed hereditary genetic predisposition was identified, whether or not related to the clinical presentation, and germline analysis impacted oncological management for only 6.3% of the cohort. This low percentage should be weighed against the burden of systematic genetic consultation and urgent circuits. Information or training tools to form oncologists to the prescription of germline genetic analyses should be explored, as well as information supports and patient preferences.",0
Experiences Navigating the Pregnancy Care Continuum During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented changes in care delivery across the pregnancy care continuum. Our primary objective with this research was to characterize the range of ways that the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic affected pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care experiences. METHODS: Pregnant and recently pregnant patients (n = 20) from obstetrics and gynecology clinical sites associated with Massachusetts General Hospital were interviewed about their experiences with prenatal care, childbirth, and postpartum care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interview transcripts were analyzed for emergent themes. RESULTS: This sample included 20 pregnant and postpartum people, including 11 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy or postpartum and nine with suspected infection. The ways in which COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19 affected experiences of prenatal care, childbirth, and postpartum care were complex and varied. Three themes were identified across narratives of pregnancy, birth, and postpartum care: patient perceptions of diminished access to care, stigma due to COVID-19 infection, and limited capacity of providers to honor patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of pregnant and recently pregnant people's experiences during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic can inform infection control policies and clinical care delivery practices that are more congruent with the needs and values of pregnant, birthing, and postpartum people as institutions craft responses to future pandemics. Approaches that maximize meaningful access across the pregnancy care continuum, center patients' priorities within adapted care models, and honor patient preferences as much as possible are important aspects of an appropriate response to future waves of COVID-19 and other pandemics.",0
Patient Preferences in Diagnostic Imaging: A Scoping Review.,"BACKGROUND: As new diagnostic imaging technologies are adopted, decisions surrounding diagnostic imaging become increasingly complex. As such, understanding patient preferences in imaging decision making is imperative. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to review quantitative patient preference studies in imaging-related decision making, including characteristics of the literature and the quality of the evidence. METHODS: The Pubmed, Embase, EconLit, and CINAHL databases were searched to identify studies involving diagnostic imaging and quantitative patient preference measures from January 2000 to June 2022. Study characteristics that were extracted included the preference elicitation method, disease focus, and sample size. We employed the PREFS (Purpose, Respondents, Explanation, Findings, Significance) checklist as our quality assessment tool. RESULTS: A total of 54 articles were included. The following methods were used to elicit preferences: conjoint analysis/discrete choice experiment methods (n = 27), contingent valuation (n = 16), time trade-off (n = 4), best-worst scaling (n = 3), multicriteria decision analysis (n = 3), and a standard gamble approach (n = 1). Half of the studies were published after 2016 (52%, 28/54). The most common scenario (n = 39) for eliciting patient preferences was cancer screening. Computed tomography, the most frequently studied imaging modality, was included in 20 studies, and sample sizes ranged from 30 to 3469 participants (mean 552). The mean PREFS score was 3.5 (standard deviation 0.8) for the included studies. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights that a variety of quantitative preference methods are being used, as diagnostic imaging technologies continue to evolve. While the number of preference studies in diagnostic imaging has increased with time, most examine preventative care/screening, leaving a gap in knowledge regarding imaging for disease characterization and management.",1
Patient preference for second- and third-line therapies in type 2 diabetes: a prespecified secondary endpoint of the TriMaster study.,"Patient preference is very important for medication selection in chronic medical conditions, like type 2 diabetes, where there are many different drugs available. Patient preference balances potential efficacy with potential side effects. As both aspects of drug response can vary markedly between individuals, this decision could be informed by the patient personally experiencing the alternative medications, as occurs in a crossover trial. In the TriMaster (NCT02653209, ISRCTN12039221), randomized double-blind, three-way crossover trial patients received three different second- or third-line once-daily type 2 diabetes glucose-lowering drugs (pioglitazone 30 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg and canagliflozin 100 mg). As part of a prespecified secondary endpoint, we examined patients' drug preference after they had tried all three drugs. In total, 448 participants were treated with all three drugs which overall showed similar glycemic control (HbA1c on pioglitazone 59.5 sitagliptin 59.9, canagliflozin 60.5 mmol mol(-1), P = 0.19). In total, 115 patients (25%) preferred pioglitazone, 158 patients (35%) sitagliptin and 175 patients (38%) canagliflozin. The drug preferred by individual patients was associated with a lower HbA1c (mean: 4.6; 95% CI: 3.9, 5.3) mmol mol(-1) lower versus nonpreferred) and fewer side effects (mean: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.64) fewer side effects versus nonpreferred). Allocating therapy based on the individually preferred drugs, rather than allocating all patients the overall most preferred drug (canagliflozin), would result in more patients achieving the lowest HbA1c for them (70% versus 30%) and the fewest side effects (67% versus 50%). When precision approaches do not predict a clear optimal therapy for an individual, allowing patients to try potential suitable medications before they choose long-term therapy could be a practical alternative to optimizing treatment for type 2 diabetes.",0
"Which symptom to address in psychological treatment for cancer survivors when fear of cancer recurrence, depressive symptoms, and cancer-related fatigue co-occur? Exploring the level of agreement between three systematic approaches to select the focus of ","PURPOSE: To investigate the extent to which three systematic approaches for prioritizing symptoms lead to similar treatment advices in cancer survivors with co-occurring fear of cancer recurrence, depressive symptoms, and/or cancer-related fatigue. METHODS: Psychological treatment advices were was based on three approaches: patient preference, symptom severity, and temporal precedence of symptoms based on ecological momentary assessments. The level of agreement was calculated according to the Kappa statistic. RESULTS: Overall, we found limited agreement between the three approaches. Pairwise comparison showed moderate agreement between patient preference and symptom severity. Most patients preferred treatment for fatigue. Treatment for fear of cancer recurrence was mostly indicated when based on symptom severity. Agreement between temporal precedence and the other approaches was slight. A clear treatment advice based on temporal precedence was possible in 57% of cases. In cases where it was possible, all symptoms were about equally likely to be indicated. CONCLUSIONS: The three approaches lead to different treatment advices. Future research should determine how the approaches are related to treatment outcome. We propose to discuss the results of each approach in a shared decision-making process to make a well-informed and personalized decision with regard to which symptom to target in psychological treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: This study contributes to the development of systematic approaches for selecting the focus of psychological treatment in cancer survivors with co-occurring symptoms by providing and comparing three different systematic approaches for prioritizing symptoms.",0
Improving oncology first-in-human and Window of opportunity informed consent forms through participant feedback.,"BACKGROUND: Although patient advocates have developed templates for standard consent forms, evaluating patient preferences for first in human (FIH) and window of opportunity (Window) trial consent forms is critical due to their unique risks. FIH trials are the initial use of a novel compound in study participants. In contrast, Window trials give an investigational agent over a fixed duration to treatment naïve patients in the time between diagnosis and standard of care (SOC) surgery. Our goal was to determine the patient-preferred presentation of important information in consent forms for these trials. METHODS: The study consisted of two phases: (1) analyses of oncology FIH and Window consents; (2) interviews of trial participants. FIH consent forms were analyzed for the location(s) of information stating that the study drug has not been tested in humans (FIH information); Window consents were analyzed for the location(s) of information stating the trial may delay SOC surgery (delay information). Participants were asked about their preferred placement of the information in their own trial's consent form. The location of information in the consent forms was compared to the participants' suggestions for placement. RESULTS: 34 [17 FIH; 17 Window] of 42(81%) cancer patients approached participated. 25 consents [20 FIH; 5 Window] were analyzed. 19/20 FIH consent forms included FIH information, and 4/5 Window consent forms included delay information. 19/20(95%) FIH consent forms contained FIH information in the risks section 12/17(71%) patients preferred the same. Fourteen (82%) patients wanted FIH information in the purpose, but only 5(25%) consents mentioned it there. 9/17(53%) Window patients preferred delay information to be located early in the consent, before the ""Risks"" section.  3/5(60%) consents did this. CONCLUSIONS: Designing consents that reflect patient preferences more accurately is essential for ethical informed consent; however, a one-size fits all approach will not accurately capture patient preferences. We found that preferences differed for FIH and Window trial consents, though for both, patients preferred key risk information early in the consent. Next steps include determining if FIH and Window consent templates improve understanding.",0
Patient preferences for treatment modalities for localised prostate cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the patient preferences and utility scores for the different conventional and innovative treatment modalities for localised prostate cancer (PCa). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients treated for localised PCa and healthy volunteers were invited to fill out a treatment-outcome scenario questionnaire. Participants ranked six different treatments for localised PCa from most to least favourable, prior to information. In a next step, treatment procedures, toxicity, risk of biochemical recurrence and follow-up regimen were comprehensibly described for each of the six treatments (i.e. treatment-outcome scenarios), after which patients re-ranked the six treatments. Additionally, participants gave a visual analogue scale (VAS) and time trade-off (TTO) score for each scenario. Differences between utility scores were tested by Friedman tests with post hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Eighty patients and twenty-nine healthy volunteers were included in the study. Before receiving treatment-outcome scenario information, participants ranked magnetic resonance-guided adaptive radiotherapy most often as their first choice (35%). After treatment information was received, active surveillance was most often ranked as the first choice (41%). Utility scores were significantly different between the six treatment-outcome scenarios, and active surveillance, non- and minimal-invasive treatments received higher scores. CONCLUSIONS: Active surveillance and non-invasive treatment for localised PCa were the most preferred options by PCa patients and healthy volunteers and received among the highest utility scores. Treatment preferences change after treatment information is received.",1
Attributes underlying patient choice of treatment modality for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion complicated by high-risk human papillomavirus infection.,"OBJECTIVE: To use logistic regression to analyze the attributes underlying patients' treatment options for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) complicated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection, and identify the best benefit group of different treatment options. METHODS: Clinical data of 197 LSIL patients with HR-HPV infection between June 2009 and February 2022 were collected. According to the treatment options chosen by the patients, they were divided into the interferon, photodynamic therapy, follow-up observation, and focused ultrasound (FUS) treatment groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the influencing factors, including age, occupation, education level, maternity history, reason for encounter, route of consultation, annual personal and household income, screening for related risk factors, and identifying the best benefit group of different treatment options. RESULTS: One-way ANOVA revealed a statistically significant difference in age, education level, maternity history, reason for encounter, and annual household income (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed on these five factors, indicating that age ≤35 years, high school educational level or higher, and no childbirth history were independent risk factors influencing patients' choices of FUS treatment. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the age threshold of 31 years. CONCLUSION: Age, educational level, and maternity history were independent risk factors influencing patients' choice of treatment modality for LSIL complicated with HR-HPV infection. Age ≤31 years, high school, equivalent, or higher educational level, and no childbirth yielded a higher rate of choosing FUS treatment for LSIL patients with HR-HPV infection.",0
Primary Whole-gland Ablation for the Treatment of Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: A Focal Therapy Society Best Practice Statement.,"CONTEXT: Whole-gland ablation is a feasible and effective minimally invasive treatment for localized prostate cancer (PCa). Previous systematic reviews supported evidence for favorable functional outcomes, but oncological outcomes were inconclusive owing to limited follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the real-world data on the mid- to long-term oncological and functional outcomes of whole-gland cryoablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in patients with clinically localized PCa, and to provide expert recommendations and commentary on these findings. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library publications through February 2022 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. As endpoints, baseline clinical characteristics, and oncological and functional outcomes were assessed. To estimate the pooled prevalence of oncological, functional, and toxicity outcomes, and to quantify and explain the heterogeneity, random-effect meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Twenty-nine studies were identified, including 14 on cryoablation and 15 on HIFU with a median follow-up of 72 mo. Most of the studies were retrospective (n = 23), with IDEAL (idea, development, exploration, assessment, and long-term study) stage 2b (n = 20) being most common. Biochemical recurrence-free survival, cancer-specific survival, overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and metastasis-free survival rates at 10 yr were 58%, 96%, 63%, 71-79%, and 84%, respectively. Erectile function was preserved in 37% of cases, and overall pad-free continence was achieved in 96% of cases, with a 1-yr rate of 97.4-98.8%. The rates of stricture, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, rectourethral fistula, and sepsis were observed to be 11%, 9.5%, 8%, 0.7%, and 0.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The mid- to long-term real-world data, and the safety profiles of cryoablation and HIFU are sound to support and be offered as primary treatment for appropriate patients with localized PCa. When compared with other existing treatment modalities for PCa, these ablative therapies provide nearly equivalent intermediate- to long-term oncological and toxicity outcomes, as well as excellent pad-free continence rates in the primary setting. This real-world clinical evidence provides long-term oncological and functional outcomes that enhance shared decision-making when balancing risks and expected outcomes that reflect patient preferences and values. PATIENT SUMMARY: Cryoablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound are minimally invasive treatments available to selectively treat localized prostate cancer, considering their nearly comparable intermediate- to long term cancer control and preservation of urinary continence to other radical treatments in the primary setting. However, a well-informed decision should be made based on one's values and preferences.",0
"Definitely, Maybe: Helping Patients Make Decisions about Surgery When Prognosis Is Uncertain.","AbstractThe sudden onset of severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) is an event suffered by millions of individuals each year. Regardless of this frequency in occurrence, accurate prognostication remains difficult to achieve among physicians. There are many variables that affect this prognosis. Physicians are expected to assess the clinical indications of the brain injury while considering other factors such as patient quality of life, patient preferences, and environmental context. However, this lack of certainty in prognosis can ultimately affect treatment recommendations and prompt clinical ethical issues at the bedside, as it leaves room for physician bias and interpretation. In this article, we introduce data on neurosurgeon values that may shed light on the process physicians and patients involved in sTBI undergo. In doing so, we highlight the many nuances in decision-making for patients suffering from sTBI and discuss potential solutions to better patient-physician or surrogate-physician interactions.",0
Establishing a Pulmonary Nodule Clinic Service for Early Diagnosis of Lung Cancer - Review of International Options and Considerations for Greece.,"Early diagnosis of lung cancer in pulmonary nodules identified by computed tomography (CT) may be critical in reducing the epidemiological burden of the disease, particularly in countries where such a burden is considerably high and risk factors for lung cancer very prevalent. The establishment and operation of pulmonary nodule clinics (PNCs), ie, multidisciplinary services that watch and evaluate nodules found through deliberate screening efforts or as incidental findings, is increasingly becoming a key tool to implement such early-intervention, cancer-risk management policies elsewhere in the world. This review aims to research and present in a structured manner findings from published sources on options and considerations for setting up a PNC in a country such as Greece. These refer to the type of services a PNC would provide to optimize diagnosis of suspect pulmonary nodules, its structure and organization, including processes, human resources and technology infrastructure, its target audience, ie, who would be eligible to use its services, and the expected outcomes of its operation, in terms of a set of key performance indicators. Our review also revealed critical key success factors that should be considered when designing the introduction of a PNC in a health care setting, including optimal referral pathways, aligned clinical decision making and patient preferences and participation/empowerment. Our findings may inform health care systems with a high lung cancer burden and no available PNC service on options and considerations before introducing such a service in their respective settings.",0
Racial and Ethnic Differences in Medication Initiation Among Adults Newly Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes.,"OBJECTIVE: Given persistent racial/ethnic differences in type 2 diabetes outcomes and the lasting benefits conferred by early glycemic control, we examined racial/ethnic differences in diabetes medication initiation during the year following diagnosis. METHODS: Among adults newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (2005-2016), we examined how glucose-lowering medication initiation differed by race/ethnicity during the year following diagnosis. We specified modified Poisson regression models to estimate the association between race/ethnicity and medication initiation in the entire cohort and within subpopulations defined by HbA1c, BMI, age at diagnosis, comorbidity, and neighborhood deprivation index (a census tract-level socioeconomic indicator). RESULTS: Among the 77,199 newly diagnosed individuals, 47% started a diabetes medication within 12 months of diagnosis. The prevalence of medication initiation ranged from 32% among Chinese individuals to 58% among individuals of Other/Unknown races/ethnicities. Compared to White individuals, medication initiation was less likely among Chinese (relative risk: 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.72, 0.84)) and Japanese (0.82 (0.75, 0.90)) individuals, but was more likely among Hispanic/Latinx (1.27 (1.24, 1.30)), African American (1.14 (1.11, 1.17)), other Asian (1.13 (1.08, 1.18)), South Asian (1.10 (1.04, 1.17)), Other/Unknown (1.31 (1.24, 1.39)), American Indian or Alaska Native (1.11 (1.04, 1.18)), and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (1.28 (1.19, 1.37)) individuals. Racial/ethnic differences dissipated among individuals with higher HbA1c values. CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of glucose-lowering treatment during the year following type 2 diabetes diagnosis differed markedly by race/ethnicity, particularly for those with lower HbA1c values. Future research should examine how patient preferences, provider implicit bias, and shared decision-making contribute to these early treatment differences.",0
Comparison of Comfort and Patient Preference of Common and a Novel Position for Ultrasound-Guided Carpal Tunnel Injections.,"OBJECTIVES: This study compared levels of discomfort among three positions for ultrasound-guided carpal tunnel injections (USCTI) to potentially facilitate and improve the procedure's tolerability in treating carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). METHODS: Ambulatory Veterans referred for electromyography (EMG) evaluation of CTS were eligible for the study; a total of 30 participants were evaluated. Participants were asked to hold three different positions: 1) Hypersupination, 2) Airplane, and 3) total supported abduction (TSA). Participants rated their pain level, ease of performing/holding each position, exacerbation of underlying symptoms, and position preference. Results were analyzed with two-way repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Hypersupination was determined to be the least preferred and most painful position to hold, demonstrating a statistically significant increase in the Numeric Rating Scale score for pain during the procedure compared with Airplane and TSA, which were not significantly different from one another. Pre-procedure neck, shoulder, elbow, and wrist pain were not significantly associated with intra-procedure pain. CONCLUSIONS: When performing USCTI, patient comfort can be optimized by avoiding Hypersupination. Utilizing the Airplane or TSA positions may provide similar access for ulnar approach injections while inducing lower levels of discomfort. Clinical space, resources, patient mobility, and laterality of procedures may further guide one's selection among the positions.",0

Giant condyloma acuminatum surgical management: a case report and literature review.,"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Condyloma acuminatum (CA) or genital warts, represents a rare sexually transmitted disease caused by the human papillomavirus. Infection occurs when host basal cells are exposed to viral infection through a damaged epithelial barrier, during sexual intercourse, or due to other minor skin abrasions. Giant condyloma acuminatum (GCA) has a higher rate of malignant transformation than CA. CASE PRESENTATION: We are presenting a 44-year-old single gentleman known as a smoker, hepatitis B positive, vitiligo, and hypercholesteromia. He was an alcoholic and had multiple heterosexual relationships abroad. Referred from the dermatology clinic, complaining of genital warts that had increased in size for 10 years. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: CA management includes local applications like imiquimod and podophyllotoxin and clinician-administered treatments such as cryotherapy, surgical excision, electrosurgery, and CO(2) laser therapy. Other options, such as interferon, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy, are available. The selection of therapy should be individualized and based upon consideration of the extent of the disease, patient preference, cost, adverse effects, treatment availability, and the response to previous treatments. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice for GCA. CONCLUSION: We present a patient with GCA in the perianal area that was surgically treated with an excellent outcome.",0
"People With Diabetes and Caregivers Prefer Rescue Glucagon Treatment With a Wider Storage Temperature Range and a Nasal Administration, When Efficacy is Similar: A Discrete Choice Experiment in Spain.","BACKGROUND: Conventional injectable glucagon (IG) and nasal glucagon (NG), both having similar efficacy, are two options for the emergency treatment of severe hypoglycemia in Spain. This study elicited the effect of changes in key attributes on preferences for NG and IG medication profiles of people with diabetes and caregivers in Spain. METHODS: The relative attribute importance (RAI) that participants placed on glucagon preparation, preparation and administration time, delivery method, recovery time, device size, storage temperature, and headache risk was estimated from an online discrete choice experiment. In addition, patients and caregivers were presented with NG and IG profiles that included rates of successful administration; the proportion of participants choosing each profile was summarized. RESULTS: The analysis included 276 adults with diabetes (65% type 1) and 270 caregivers (49% type 1). Overall mean age was 40 years; 51% were female. The most important attributes were storage temperature (RAI [95% confidence interval] = 27.3% [22.9-32.2]) and delivery method (17.4% [13.1-21.9]). Headache risk (16.2% [11.8-20.7]), time to prepare and administer (14.5% [10.1-18.8]), glucagon preparation (11.4% [6.8-15.8]), recovery time (8.9% [4.3-13.3]), and device size (4.3% [0.3-8.8]) were also relevant. When comparing medication profiles, significantly more participants (78%) preferred NG over IG profiles (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Adults with diabetes and caregivers prefer a glucagon treatment with a higher rate of successful administration, wider storage temperature, and nasal delivery method, when efficacy is similar. Participants favored NG over conventional IG as a rescue medication for severe hypoglycemia. This information may help decision-making by payers and treatment discussions between health care professionals and patients.",1
Patient Preferences for the Management of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Kidney Transplantation: a Discrete Choice Experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in kidney transplant are common and debilitating. We aimed to ascertain patients' preferences for GI symptom management options to help future interventions align with treatment priorities. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was conducted with kidney transplant recipients in 3 Australian nephrology units. A multinomial logit model was used to quantify the preferences and trade-offs between 5 characteristics: cost, formulation, symptom burden, dietary changes, and medication quantities. RESULTS: Seventy patients participated (mean age ± SD: 47 ± 15 years, 56% female), 57% had GI symptoms. Patients preferred interventions that will achieve complete resolution of GI symptoms compared to no improvement (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 15.3 [1.80, 129.50]), were delivered as a tablet rather than a sachet (1.6 [1.27, 2.08]), retained their current diet compared to eliminating food groups (6.0 [2.19, 16.27]), reduced medication burden (1.4 [1.06, 1.79]), and had lower costs (0.98 [0.96, 1.00]). Participants would be willing to pay AUD$142.20 [$83.90, $200.40] monthly to achieve complete resolution of GI symptoms or AUD$100.90 [$9.60, $192.10] to have moderate improvement in symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that are highly effective in relieving all GI symptoms without the need for substantive dietary changes, and in tablet form, are most preferred by kidney transplant recipients.",1
Patient Perception of Route of Rectal Administration of Live Biotherapeutic Product for Recurrent Clostridioides difficile Infection.,"INTRODUCTION: CDI is a recurrent disease that is treated with antibiotics, but patients commonly experience repeat infections with significant impacts on hospital budgets and patient health quality. Standard of care management includes the antibiotics, vancomycin and fidaxomicin, which frequently provide clinical response, but do not avoid recurrence of Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI). These recurrent infections occur due to dysbiosis of the colonic microbiota. One adjunctive therapeutic approach is to restore the deficient gastrointestinal flora using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or live biotherapeutic products (LBP) when given after standard of care antimicrobials, which have been successful in reducing repeat infections with success rates up to 88%. FMT or LBP can be given by various routes. METHODS: Two groups of subjects aged ≥18 years with at least one previous CDI episode within the previous 36 months completed self-administered online surveys to assess the acceptability of an LBP administered rectally. Group 1 consisted of LBP-recipients who had received RBL (REBYOTA) rectally as part of the Phase III PUNCH CD3 clinical trial. Group 2 consisted of LBP-naïve subjects who volunteered to participate and had experienced CDI within the prior 36 months but had no history of receiving FMT or LBP therapy. RESULTS: LBP-recipients considered rectal administration easy (96%) and quick (94%), while 98% of respondents considered the lack of need for bowel preparation appealing. Most LBP-recipients (96%) wished they had earlier access to RBL. Most LBP-naïve subjects (87%) were likely or somewhat likely to consider a rectally administered treatment and 80% preferred a treatment option that does not require bowel preparation. Many of these subjects (76%) expressed interest in finding out about new treatment options for rCDI. DISCUSSION: LBP-recipients and LBP-naïve subjects alike felt that rectal delivery of microbiome therapy is not only acceptable but highly interesting as a treatment avenue.",0
"Advancements in Varicose Vein Treatment: Anatomy, Pathophysiology, Minimally Invasive Techniques, Sclerotherapy, Patient Satisfaction, and Future Directions.","Varicose veins are a common vascular condition known for causing discomfort and cosmetic concerns. This comprehensive narrative review delves into their anatomy, pathophysiology, and modern treatment options, with a focus on endovenous techniques and sclerotherapy. The review starts by emphasizing the intricate anatomy of lower extremity venous circulation, underlining the significance of both superficial and deep venous networks in venous return. It also addresses how changes in the venous wall, including valvular insufficiency, contribute to the development of varicose veins. Endovenous techniques like endovenous laser ablation (EVLA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and mechanochemical endovenous ablation (MOCA) are explored in detail. These minimally invasive procedures have revolutionized varicose vein treatment, offering high success rates and quicker recovery compared to traditional surgery. The review also highlights their efficacy and safety profiles, aiding clinicians in informed decision-making. Sclerotherapy, a vital modality for varicose veins, is thoroughly examined, covering both liquid and foam sclerotherapy. Foam sclerotherapy, in particular, is recognized for its improved outcomes. The review provides a comprehensive comparison of these treatment modalities, highlighting differences in technical success, recurrence rates, and cost-effectiveness. Patient preferences and satisfaction play a significant role in choosing the right treatment. Safety and potential complications associated with these treatments are explored, with a focus on minor issues and rare adverse events. This review also emphasizes the positive impact of varicose vein interventions on patients' quality of life.",0
Queensland Inpatient Diabetes Survey (QuIDS): patient experience survey evaluation.,"BACKGROUND: Measurement of inpatient experience can allow for treatment tailored to patient preferences and needs. The patient experience of diabetes care has not been explored in Queensland hospitals. AIMS: To investigate the experiences of patients with diabetes when hospitalised using the Queensland Inpatient Diabetes Survey (QuIDS). METHODS: In 2019 and 2021, patient experience surveys were collected as part of the statewide QuIDS, a cross-sectional study assessing the quality of inpatient care received by people with diabetes in Queensland, Australia. Patient responses were categorised and frequencies reported as percentages. Free text comments were analysed using thematic analysis methods. Pooled descriptive data were presented. RESULTS: Responses were collected from 27 hospitals in 2019 (n = 526, 52.4% of all patients with diabetes) and 35 hospitals in 2021 (n = 709, 55.5%). Overall, patients were satisfied with their inpatient diabetes care. Areas for improvement identified by surveyed patients include the choice and timing of meals, staff knowledge about diabetes and increased diabetes self-management. Access to a specialist diabetes team was also identified as being potentially underutilised. Patient comments fell into four major themes: communication, food choices, patient autonomy and education. CONCLUSION: Many patients reported positive inpatient experiences; however, patients also expressed dissatisfaction with their inpatient diabetes care. Our data provide unique insight and an opportunity to improve standards of care and service provision for inpatients with diabetes.",0
Solid-state analysis for pharmaceuticals: Pathways to feasible and meaningful analysis.,"The solid state of matter is the preferred starting point for designing a pharmaceutical product. This is driven by both patient preferences and the relative ease of supplying a solid pharmaceutical product with desired quality and performance. Solid form diversity is increasingly prevalent as a crucial element in designing these products, which underpins the importance of solid-state analytical methods. This paper provides a critical analysis of challenges related to solid-state analytics, as well as considerations and suggestions for feasible and meaningful pharmaceutical analysis.",0
Mapping European Association of Urology Guideline Practice Across Europe: An Audit of Androgen Deprivation Therapy Use Before Prostate Cancer Surgery in 6598 Cases in 187 Hospitals Across 31 European Countries.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-practice gaps exist in urology. We previously surveyed European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for strong recommendations underpinned by high-certainty evidence that impact patient experience for which practice variations were suspected. The recommendation ""Do not offer neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) before surgery for patients with prostate cancer"" was prioritised for further investigation. ADT before surgery is neither clinically effective nor cost effective and has serious side effects. The first step in improving implementation problems is to understand their extent. A clear picture of practice regarding ADT before surgery across Europe is not available. OBJECTIVE: To assess current ADT use before prostate cancer surgery in Europe. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an observational cross-sectional study. We retrospectively audited recent ADT practices in a multicentre international setting. We used nonprobability purposive sampling, aiming for breadth in terms of low- versus high-volume, academic, versus community and public versus private centres. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Our primary outcome was adherence to the ADT recommendation. Descriptive statistics and a multilevel model were used to investigate differences between countries across different factors (volume, centre type, and funding type). Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with low, intermediate, and high risk, and for those with locally advanced prostate cancer. We also collected reasons for nonadherence. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We included 6598 patients with prostate cancer from 187 hospitals in 31 countries from January 1, 2017 to May 1, 2020. Overall, nonadherence was 2%, (range 0-32%). Most of the variability was found in the high-risk subgroup, for which nonadherence was 4% (range 0-43%). Reasons for nonadherence included attempts to improve oncological outcomes or preoperative tumour parameters; attempts to control the cancer because of long waiting lists; and patient preference (changing one's mind from radiotherapy to surgery after neoadjuvant ADT had commenced or feeling that the side effects were intolerable). Although we purposively sampled for variety within countries (public/private, academic/community, high/low-volume), a selection bias toward centres with awareness of guidelines is possible, so adherence rates may be overestimated. CONCLUSIONS: EAU guidelines recommend against ADT use before prostate cancer surgery, yet some guideline-discordant ADT use remains at the cost of patient experience and an additional payer and provider burden. Strategies towards discontinuation of inappropriate preoperative ADT use should be pursued. PATIENT SUMMARY: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is sometimes used in men with prostate cancer who will not benefit from it. ADT causes side effects such as weight gain and emotional changes and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Guidelines strongly recommend that men opting for surgery should not receive ADT, but it is unclear how well the guidance is followed. We asked urologists across Europe how patients in their institutions were treated over the past few years. Most do not use ADT before surgery, but this still happens in some places. More research is needed to help doctors to stop using ADT in patients who will not benefit from it.",0
"Cognitive-behavioral, behavioural and mindfulness-based therapies for insomnia in menopause.","OBJECTIVES: Insomnia is frequently reported by women during menopause due to physiological changes and environmental factors and is associated with negative daytime sequelae. Due to medication side effects and patient preferences, there is increased interest in the use of psychological treatments for menopausal insomnia. The primary objective of this review is to review the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral, behavioral, and mindfulness-based (CBBMB) therapies in treating insomnia in peri- and post-menopausal women. The secondary objective is to review the effect of CBBMB therapies on relevant secondary outcomes to gain a comprehensive understanding of their impacts. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of the literature. A search of PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted between January 2020 and March 2021. RESULTS: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia is efficacious, with corollary improvements in mood, functional outcomes and potential mechanistic factors (e.g., unhelpful beliefs). Sleep restriction therapy is also efficacious, with somewhat poorer effects on secondary outcomes relative to CBT. Mindfulness meditation and relaxation for insomnia demonstrated promise, but its long-term effects remain unknown. CONCLUSIONS: Research with more diverse samples and head-to-head comparisons is needed. Dissemination of CBBMBs for insomnia in clinics where menopausal women seek care is an important next step.",0
Pharmacogenomic Testing for Major Depression: A Qualitative Study of the Perceptions of People with Lived Experience and Professional Stakeholders.,"OBJECTIVES: With increasing evidence for the clinical utility of pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing for depression, there is a growing need to consider issues related to the clinical implementation of this testing. The perspectives of key stakeholders (both people with lived experience [PWLE] and providers) are critical, but not frequently explored. The purpose of this study was to understand how PWLE and healthcare providers/policy experts (P/HCPs) perceive PGx testing for depression, to inform the consideration of clinical implementation within the healthcare system in British Columbia (BC), Canada. METHODS: We recruited two cohorts of participants to complete individual 1-h, semi-structured interviews: (a) PWLE, recruited from patient and research engagement networks and organizations and (b) P/HCPs, recruited via targeted invitation. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, de-identified, and analysed using interpretive description. RESULTS: Seventeen interviews were completed with PWLE (7 with experience of PGx testing for depression; 10 without); 15 interviews were completed with P/HCPs (family physicians, psychiatrists, nurses, pharmacists, genetic counsellors, medical geneticists, lab technologists, program directors, and insurers). Visual models of PWLE's and P/HCP's perceptions of and attitudes towards PGx testing were developed separately, but both were heavily influenced by participants' prior professional and/or personal experiences with depression and/or PGx testing. Both groups expressed a need for evidence and numerous considerations for the implementation of PGx testing in BC, including the requirement for conclusive economic analyses, patient and provider education, technological and clinical support, local testing facilities, and measures to ensure equitable access to testing. CONCLUSIONS: While hopeful about the potential for therapeutic benefit from PGx testing, PWLE and P/HCPs see the need for robust evidence of utility, and BC-wide infrastructure and policies to ensure equitable and effective access to PGx testing. Further research into the accessibility, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of various implementation strategies is needed to inform PGx testing use in BC.",0
Use of Stated Preference Methods in HIV Treatment and Prevention Research in the United States: A Systematic Review.,"Stated preference (SP) methods are increasingly being applied to HIV-related research and continuously provide researchers with health utility scores of select healthcare products or services that populations consider important. Following PRISMA guidelines, we sought to understand how SP methods have been applied in HIV-related research. We conducted a systematic review to identify studies meeting the following criteria: SP method is clearly stated, conducted in the United States, was published between 01/01/2012 and 02/12/2022, and included adults aged 18 and over. Study design and SP method application were also examined. We identified six SP methods (e.g., Conjoint Analysis, Discrete Choice Experiment) across 18 studies, which were categorized into one of two groups: HIV prevention and HIV treatment-care. Categories of attributes used in SP methods largely focused on: administration, physical/health effects, financial, location, access, and external influences. SP methods are innovative tools capable of informing researchers on what populations consider most beneficial when deciding on treatment, care, or prevention options for HIV.",1
Optimizing care delivery in expanding health systems: Views from clinical leaders.,"INTRODUCTION: In response to intense market pressures, many hospitals have consolidated into systems. However, evidence suggests that consolidation has not led to the improvements in clinical quality promised by proponents of mergers. The challenges to delivering care within expanding health systems and the opportunities posed to surgical leaders remains largely unexplored. METHODS: Semistructured interviews with 30 surgical leaders at teaching hospitals affiliated with health systems from August-December 2019. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded in an iterative process using MaxQDA software. Attitudes and strategies toward redesigning health care delivery across expanding systems were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Leaders reported challenges to redesigning care delivery across the system ranging from resource constraints (e.g. hospital beds and operating rooms) to evolving market demands (e.g., patient preferences to receive care close to home). However, participants also highlighted that system expansion provided multiple opportunities to increase access (e.g. decant low-complexity care to affiliated centers) and improve quality of care (e.g. standardize best practices) for diverse populations including the potential to leverage their health system to expand access and improve quality. CONCLUSIONS: Though evidence suggests that hospital consolidation has not led to redesigned care delivery or improved clinical quality at a national level, leaders are pursuing varying sets of strategies aimed at leveraging system expansion in order to improve access and quality of care.",0
"Comprehensive, Evidence-Based, Consensus Guidelines for Prescription of Opioids for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP).","BACKGROUND: Opioid prescribing in the United States is decreasing, however, the opioid epidemic is continuing at an uncontrollable rate. Available data show a significant number of opioid deaths, primarily associated with illicit fentanyl use. It is interesting to also note that the data show no clear correlation between opioid prescribing (either number of prescriptions or morphine milligram equivalent [MME] per capita), opioid hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, the data suggest that the 2016 guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have resulted in notable problems including increased hospitalizations and mental health disorders due to the lack of appropriate opioid prescribing as well as inaptly rapid tapering or weaning processes. Consequently, when examined in light of other policies and complications caused by COVID-19, a fourth wave of the opioid epidemic has been emerging. OBJECTIVES: In light of this, we herein seek to provide guidance for the prescription of opioids for the management of chronic non-cancer pain. These clinical practice guidelines are based upon a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological evidence and have been developed by a panel of multidisciplinary experts assessing the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations and offer a clear explanation of logical relationships between various care options and health outcomes. METHODS: The methods utilized included the development of objectives and key questions for the various facets of opioid prescribing practice. Also utilized were employment of trustworthy standards, and appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest(s). The literature pertaining to opioid use, abuse, effectiveness, and adverse consequences was reviewed. The recommendations were developed after the appropriate review of text and questions by a panel of multidisciplinary subject matter experts, who tabulated comments, incorporated changes, and developed focal responses to questions posed. The multidisciplinary panel finalized 20 guideline recommendations for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Summary of the results showed over 90% agreement for the final 20 recommendations with strong consensus. The consensus guidelines included 4 sections specific to opioid therapy with 1) ten recommendations particular to initial steps of opioid therapy; 2) five recommendations for assessment of effectiveness of opioid therapy; 3) three recommendations regarding monitoring adherence and side effects; and 4) two general, final phase recommendations. LIMITATIONS: There is a continued paucity of literature of long-term opioid therapy addressing chronic non-cancer pain. Further, significant biases exist in the preparation of guidelines, which has led to highly variable rules and regulations across various states. CONCLUSION: These guidelines were developed based upon a comprehensive review of the literature, consensus among expert panelists, and in alignment with patient preferences, and shared decision-making so as to improve the long-term pain relief and function in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. Consequently, it was concluded - and herein recommended - that chronic opioid therapy should be provided in low doses with appropriate adherence monitoring and understanding of adverse events only to those patients with a proven medical necessity, and who exhibit stable improvement in both pain relief and activities of daily function, either independently or in conjunction with other modalities of treatments.",0

Approach to Patients with High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer: Radiation Oncology Perspective.,"High-risk localized prostate cancer is a challenging clinical entity to treat, with heterogeneous responses to an evolving array of multidisciplinary treatment approaches. In addition, this disease state is growing in incidence due to a variety of factors, including shifting recommendations that discouraged routine prostate cancer screening. Current guidelines now incorporate an informed decision-making process for prostate cancer screening and evaluation. More work is underway to improve targeted screening for certain at-risk populations and to implement greater personalization in the use of diagnostic tools. Once diagnosed with high-risk localized disease, a multimodality treatment paradigm is warranted. Radiation-in its various forms and combinations-plays a large and continually evolving role in the management of high-risk prostate cancer, yet treatment outcomes are still suboptimal. There is a growing need to improve upon current treatment approaches, and better personalize a particular treatment recommendation based on both tumor and patient characteristics, as well as patient preference and goals of therapy. Given that treatment generally requires more than one therapy, there are notable implications on long-term quality of life, especially with respect to overlapping and cumulative side effects of local and systemic therapies, respectively. The desire for aggressive therapy to optimize cancer control outcomes must be weighed against the risk of morbidities and overtreatment and discussed with each patient so that an informed decision about treatment and care can be determined. High-level evidence to support treatment recommendations, where available, is critical for a data-driven and tailored approach to address all goals of care.",0
A 23-year-old patient with bilateral hypoplastic thumbs and toes: A case report.,"KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: However, it is noteworthy that certain patients with minor functional limitations in their hand may have experienced undiagnosed thumb hypoplasia during their childhood years. These individuals may have successfully adapted to their condition without seeking medical intervention and may express a preference for nonintervention (as in this case). ABSTRACT: Thumb hypoplasia is a congenital underdevelopment of the thumb, accounting for 5%-15% of congenital hand disorders. It occurs equally among both genders and can affect both thumbs. The condition is categorized using Blauth's classification with Type I being the mildest form. We report a 23-year-old Syrian male presented with a bilateral restriction in opposition movement when using a pen or razor. Clinical examination and x-ray imaging revealed a bilateral Type I hypoplastic thumb with bilateral minimal hypoplasia of the toes. Despite the surgical treatment options available, the patient opted not to undergo surgery due to his adaptation to his condition. Hypoplastic thumb Type I is a congenital condition characterized by underdevelopment of the thumb. Bilateral thumb hypoplasia with toes hypoplasia is extremely rare. A full systemic evaluation should be done due to its associations with other syndromic manifestations and treatment options are discussed concerning the best functional outcomes and patient preferences.",0
High-Grade Ectopic Pituitary Adenoma within the Cerebellopontine Angle: A Case Report.,"Ectopic pituitary tumors are neoplasms with no connection to the pituitary gland and are commonly deposited in other areas of the anterior skull base. A 32-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of right-sided facial weakness, sensorineural hearing loss, diplopia, and severe headaches. Physical examination revealed a mid-dilated sluggishly reactive right pupil with slight limitation in all gazes, as well as right-sided orbicularis weakness, lagophthalmos, and decreased facial sensation. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head without contrast revealed a 3.7 × 1.8 × 2.6 cm mildly enhancing mass in the right internal acoustic meatus and along the petrous ridge. The case was brought before the institution's tumor board, where concern for higher grade pathology, such as hemangiopericytoma, was discussed. Per patient preference, surgical biopsy of the tumor was performed. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a World Health Organization (WHO) grade II neuroendocrine tumor, with cells staining positive for synaptophysin, chromogranin, and CD56, with a K (i) -67 index of 8%. In addition to the ectopic location, this pituitary tumor was noted to be aggressive in nature based on its high K (i) -67 index. Surgical excision and radiologic therapy of tumors involving the CPA are appropriate treatments in most cases.",0
Contributing and limiting factors to guideline-adherent therapy in senior and elderly breast cancer patients: a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study using clinical and cancer registry data in Germany.,"PURPOSE: Elderly cancer patients are less likely to be treated in accordance with evidence-based guideline recommendations. This study examines patient-related factors associated with deviations from guideline recommendations. METHODS: Using medical documentation and cancer registry data, we investigated the treatment courses of female breast cancer patients aged 50 and older in Germany regarding compliance with German guidelines. Participants completed a questionnaire querying factors hypothesized to be associated with guideline adherence. We conducted univariate analyses to explore the data and select variables for multivariate logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: Of 1150 participants, 206 (17.9%) were treated in deviation from guideline recommendations. Patients 70 years and older were more likely to be treated deviating from guideline recommendations than patients 50-69 years old (OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.52-2.80). Patients aged 50-69 years who reported that quality of life guided their treatment decision were more likely to be treated in deviation from guideline recommendations (AOR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.11-3.92) than the elderly. In older patients, higher age was associated with an increased chance of receiving guideline-discordant care (AOR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01-1.11), as was depression diagnosed prior to cancer (AOR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.00-3.40). CONCLUSION: Reasons for deviations from guideline recommendations in breast cancer patients differ by age. In decision-making concerning elderly patients, particular attention should be paid to those with pre-existing depressive disorders. Adequately addressing their needs and concerns could prevent inappropriate deviations from guideline recommendations.",0
Adaptation of the WOMAC for Use in a Patient Preference Study.,"OBJECTIVES: To adapt a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure, the Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), into efficacy attributes for a discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey designed to quantify the relative importance of endpoints commonly used in knee osteoarthritis (KOA) trials. METHODS: The adaptation comprised four steps: (1) selecting domains of interest; (2) determining presentation and framing of selected attributes; (3) determining attribute levels; and (4) developing choice tasks. This process involved input from multiple stakeholders, including regulators, health preference researchers, and patients. Pretesting was conducted to evaluate if patients comprehended the adapted survey attributes and could make trade-offs among them. RESULTS: The WOMAC pain and function domains were selected for adaption to two efficacy attributes. Two versions of the discrete choice experiment (DCE) instrument were created to compare efficacy using (1) total domain scores and (2) item scores for ""walking on a flat surface."" Both attributes were presented as improvement from baseline scores by levels of 0%, 30%, 50%, and 100%. Twenty-six participants were interviewed in a pretest of the instrument (average age 60 years; 58% female; 62% had KOA for ≥ 5 years). The participants found both versions of attributes meaningful and relevant for treatment decision-making. They demonstrated willingness and ability to tradeoff improvements in pain and function separately, though many perceived them as inter-related. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the growing literature regarding adapting PRO measures for patient preference studies. Such adaptation is important for designing a preference study that can incorporate a clinical trial's outcomes with PRO endpoints.",1
Patient Preferences for Attributes that Characterise Alternative Models of Care in Gastroenterology: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: Increased demand for gastroenterology services has resulted in growing waitlists, with patients at risk of exceeding clinically recommended wait-times. Given limited healthcare resources, expanded scope models of care are an option to help address this demand, but little is known about patient preferences for these models of care. METHODS: Low-risk gastroenterology patients (n = 1198) referred to an outpatient tertiary service in Australia over a 2-year period were invited to participate in an unlabelled discrete choice experiment with seven attributes: primary healthcare professional, wait-time, continuity of care, consultation length, manner and communication skills, reassurance, and cost. These were developed using qualitative research, literature review, and stakeholders' experiences. A d-efficient fractional design was used to construct four blocks of 12 choice sets, with two alternatives. A 13th choice set was included as a data and quality check. Latent class and mixed logit regression were used for analysis. The resulting preference parameters for individual attributes were then used to calculate willingness to pay and willingness to wait. RESULTS: Overall, the model based on the 347 respondents suggested no strong preference for professional background. All other attributes were statistically significant predictors of preference (p < 0.001), with respondents willing to make significant trade-offs (time and cost) before accepting deterioration in attributes. There was strong emphasis on manner and communication skills, with a clinician who listens and provides good explanations overwhelmingly the most important attribute. Latent class analysis identified two patient segments who differed in their preference for the primary treating healthcare professional (doctor or dietitian) based on exposure to either traditional medical or non-medical professional role substitution model. CONCLUSIONS: Patients have strong but varied preferences for gastroenterology services based on whether they have been exposed to expanded scope models of care. Design and implementation of new models of care need to consider strategies to overcome any perceived loss in utility or deterioration in healthcare quality for those unfamiliar with professional role substitution.",1
In-Hospital Code Status Updates: Trends Over Time and the Impact of COVID-19.,"OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to evaluate if the percentage of patients with missing or inaccurate code status documentation at a Trauma Level 1 hospital could be reduced through daily updates. The secondary objective was to examine if patient preferences for DNR changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective study, spanning March 2019 to December 2022, compared the code status in ICU and ED patients drawn from two data sets. The first was based on historical electronic medical records (EHR), and the second involved daily updates of code status following patient admission. RESULTS: Implementing daily updates upon admission was more effective in ICUs than in the ED in reducing missing code status documentation. Around 20% of patients without a specific code status chose DNR under the new system. During COVID-19, a decrease in ICU patients choosing DNR and an increase in full code (FC) choices were observed. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of regular updates and discussions regarding code status to enhance patient care and resource allocation in ICU and ED settings. The COVID-19 pandemic's influence on shifting patient preferences towards full code status underscores the need for adaptable documentation practices. Emphasizing patient education about DNR implications and benefits is key to supporting informed decisions that reflect individual health contexts and values. This approach will help balance the considerations for DNR and full code choices, especially during health care crises.",0
Taking a chance: How likely am I to receive my preferred treatment in a clinical trial?,"Researchers should ideally conduct clinical trials under a presumption of clinical equipoise, but in fact trial patients will often prefer one or other of the treatments being compared. Receiving an unblinded preferred treatment may affect the study outcome, possibly beneficially, but receiving a non-preferred treatment may induce 'reluctant acquiescence', and poorer outcomes. Even in blinded trials, patients' primary motivation to enrol may be the chance of potentially receiving a desirable experimental treatment, which is otherwise unavailable. Study designs with a higher probability of receiving a preferred treatment (denoted as 'concordance') will be attractive to potential participants, and investigators, because they may improve recruitment and hence enhance study efficiency. Therefore, it is useful to consider the concordance rates associated with various study designs. We consider this question with a focus on comparing the standard, randomised, two-arm, parallel group design with the two-stage randomised patient preference design and Zelen designs; we also mention the fully randomised and partially randomised patient preference designs. For each of these designs, we evaluate the concordance rate as a function of the proportions randomised to the alternative treatments, the distribution of preferences over treatments, and (for the Zelen designs) the proportion of patients who consent to receive their assigned treatment. We also examine the equity of each design, which we define as the similarity between the concordance rates for participants with different treatment preferences. Finally, we contrast each of the alternative designs with the standard design in terms of gain in concordance and change in equity.",0
National survey on management of spontaneous pneumothorax from emergency department to specialised treatment: room for improvement.,"INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) affects both young, otherwise healthy individuals and older persons with known underlying pulmonary disease. Initial management possibilities are evolving and range from observation to chest tube insertion. SP guidelines suggest an individualized approach based on multiple factors such as symptoms, size of pneumothorax, comorbidity and patient preference. AIM: With this Danish national survey we aimed to map organization of care including involved specialties, treatment choice, training, and follow-up plans to identify aspects, and optimization of spontaneous pneumothorax management. METHOD: A survey developed by the national interest group for pleural medicine was sent to all departments of emergency medicine, thoracic surgery, respiratory medicine, and to relevant departments of abdominal or orthopaedic surgery. RESULTS: The response rate was 75 % (47 of 65). Overall, 21% of responding departments had no guideline for SP management, which was provided by multiple specialties with marked heterogeneity in choice of treatment including tube size, management during admission, and referral procedure to follow-up. Few departments required procedure training, and nearly all of the responders called for improvements in management of pneumothorax. CONCLUSION: This survey suggests that SP management and care is delivered heterogeneously across Danish hospitals with marked difference between respiratory physicians, emergency physicians, general surgeons and thoracic surgeons. It is therefore likely that management is sub-optimal. There is a need for a common Danish SP guideline to ensure optimal treatment across involved specialties.",0
Preferences in medications for patients seeking treatment for opioid use disorder: A conjoint analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: The opioid epidemic continues to be a public health crisis that has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are the most effective way to reduce complications from opioid use disorder (OUD), but uptake is limited by both structural and individual factors. To inform strategies addressing individual factors, we evaluated patients' preferences and trade-offs in treatment decisions using conjoint analysis. METHOD: We developed a conjoint analysis survey evaluating patients' preferences for FDA-approved MOUDs. We recruited patients with OUD presenting to initiate treatment. This survey included five attributes: induction, location and route of administration, impact on mortality, side effects, and withdrawal symptoms with cessation. Participants performed 12 choice sets, each with two hypothetical profiles and a ""none"" option. We used Hierarchical Bayes to identify relative importance of each attribute and part-worth utility scores of levels, which we compared using chi-squared analysis. We used the STROBE checklist to guide our reporting of this cross-sectional observational study. RESULTS: Five-hundred and thirty participants completed the study. Location with route of administration was the most important attribute. Symptom relief during induction and withdrawal was a second priority. Mortality followed by side effects had lowest relative importance. Attribute levels with highest part-worth utilities showed patients preferred monthly pick-up from a pharmacy rather than daily supervised dosing; and oral medications more than injection/implants, despite the latter's infrequency. CONCLUSION: We measured treatment preferences among patients seeking to initiate OUD treatment to inform strategies to scale MOUD treatment uptake. Patients prioritize the route of administration in treatment preference-less frequent pick up, but also injections and implants were less preferred despite their convenience. Second, patients prioritize symptom relief during the induction and withdrawal procedures of medication. These transition periods influence the sustainability of treatment. Although health professionals prioritize mortality, it did not drive decision-making for patients. To our knowledge, this is the largest study on patients' preferences for MOUD among treatment-seeking people with OUD to date. Future analysis will evaluate patient preference heterogeneity to further target program planning, counseling, and decision aid development.",1
American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Practice Guideline: Pharmacological Management of Chronic Idiopathic Constipation.,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is a common disorder associated with significant impairment in quality of life. This clinical practice guideline, jointly developed by the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology, aims to inform clinicians and patients by providing evidence-based practice recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of CIC in adults. METHODS: The American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that conducted systematic reviews of the following agents: fiber, osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol, magnesium oxide, lactulose), stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, senna), secretagogues (lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide), and serotonin type 4 agonist (prucalopride). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to assess the certainty of evidence for each intervention. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop clinical recommendations based on the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 10 recommendations for the pharmacological management of CIC in adults. Based on available evidence, the panel made strong recommendations for the use of polyethylene glycol, sodium picosulfate, linaclotide, plecanatide, and prucalopride for CIC in adults. Conditional recommendations were made for the use of fiber, lactulose, senna, magnesium oxide, and lubiprostone. DISCUSSION: This document provides a comprehensive outline of the various over-the-counter and prescription pharmacological agents available for the treatment of CIC. The guidelines are meant to provide a framework for approaching the management of CIC; clinical providers should engage in shared decision making based on patient preferences as well as medication cost and availability. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted to help guide future research opportunities and enhance the care of patients with chronic constipation.",0
Structural barriers or patient preference? A mixed methods appraisal of medical abortion use in England and Wales.,"Although patient choice of abortion method is a key component of quality care, medical abortion (MA) has become the most common method (87%) in England and Wales, as in many countries worldwide. This research aimed to critically examine factors influencing the growth in MA use in England and Wales. Mixed methods were used, combining multi-level regression analysis of national abortion statistics (2011-2020) and key informant interviews with abortion service managers, commissioners, and providers (n=27). Overall trends have been driven by growth in MA use for abortions under 10 weeks in the private non-profit sector. Variation in MA use between patient sub-groups and regions has narrowed over time. Qualitative findings highlight health system constraints that have influenced the shift towards MA, including workforce constraints, infrastructure requirements, provider policies, cost, and commissioning practices involving under-funding and competition, which have caused the private non-profit sector to limit method choice across their services to remain financially viable. While removal of legal restrictions on MA has expanded choice, similar policy progress has not been seen for surgical methods. The study concludes that abortion method choice has been constrained by structural health system factors, with potential negative consequences for service acceptability, inequalities, and patient-centredness.",0
Prolonged diversion after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis: Is it safe to wait?,"AIM: Diverting loop ileostomy reversal (DLI-R) is routinely performed from 2-6 months following ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). The safety of delayed reversal after IPAA is not well-defined. The aim of this study was to determine if prolonged diversion is associated with adverse outcomes compared to routine closure. METHODS: Adult patients undergoing primary IPAA with DLI from 2000 to 2021 were included in this retrospective cohort study from our institutional database. Patients were stratified into tertiles based on timing of reversal: Routine (56-116 days), Delayed (117-180 days), or Prolonged (>6 months). Univariate analysis compared categorical variables between groups. Patients reversed at <8 weeks were excluded. RESULTS: In total, 2615 patients underwent DLI-R following IPAA (3-stage 61%, 2-stage 39%; mean age 39.9 years). DLI-R was performed as Routine, Delayed and Prolonged in 1908 (72.9%), 426 (16.4%) and 281 (10.8%), respectively. Overall, DLI-R related complications occurred in 12.4% (n = 324). The complication rate in the Routine group was 11% (n = 210), in the Delayed group was 12.2% (n = 52) and in the Prolonged group was 22.1% (n = 62). Reasons for prolonged diversion in the Prolonged group were complications at the time of IPAA in 207 (73.9%) or patient preference/scheduling in 73 (26.1%). DLI-R >6 months after IPAA due to complications had higher rates of overall complications following ileostomy reversal (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.85-3.72, p < 0.001) whereas when DLI-R was delayed due to preference/scheduling outcomes were not different than the Routine group (p = 0.28). CONCLUSION: Prolonged time to ileostomy reversal after IPAA is probably safe without increased risk of complications when due to patient preference.",0
Patient Preferences in Targeted Pharmacotherapy for Cancers: A Systematic Review of Discrete Choice Experiments.,"BACKGROUND: Targeted pharmacotherapy has been increasingly applied in cancer treatment due to its breakthroughs. However, the unmet needs of cancer patients are still significant, highlighting the urgency to investigate patient preferences. It is unclear how patients deliberate their choices between different aspects of targeted therapy, including cost, efficacy, and adverse events. Since discrete choice experiments (DCEs) have been widely applied to patient preference elicitation, we reviewed DCEs on targeted therapy for different cancers. We also synthesized evidence on the factors influencing patients' choices and their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for survival when treated by targeted therapy. METHODS: We searched databases, including PubMed, EMBASE and MEDLINE, up to August 16, 2022, supplemented by a reference screening. The attributes from the selected studies were categorized into three groups: outcomes, costs, and process. We also calculated the relative importance of attributes and WTP for survival whenever possible. The purpose, respondents, explanation, findings, significance (PREFS) checklist was used to evaluate the quality of the included DCE studies. RESULTS: The review identified 34 eligible studies from 13 countries covering 14 cancers, such as breast, ovarian, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers. It also reveals a rising trend of DCEs on this topic, as most studies were published after 2018. We found that patients placed higher weights on the outcome (e.g., overall survival) and cost attributes than on process attributes. On average, patients were willing to pay $561 (95% confidence interval [CI]: $415-$758) and $716 (95% CI $524-$958) out-of-pocket for a 1-month increase in progression-free survival and overall survival, respectively. PREFS scores of the 34 studies ranged from 2 to 4, with a mean of 3.38 (SD: 0.65), suggesting a reasonable quality based on the checklist. However, most studies (n = 32, 94%) did not assess the impact of non-responses on the results. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first systematic review focusing on patient preferences for targeted cancer therapy. We showcased novel approaches for evidence synthesis of DCE results, especially the attribute relative importance and WTP. The results may inform stakeholders about patient preferences toward targeted therapy and their WTP estimates. More studies with improved study design and quality are warranted to generate more robust evidence to assist decision making.",1
Primary and Specialist Palliative Care in Neurosurgery: A Narrative Review and Bibliometric Analysis of Glioblastoma and Stroke.,"OBJECTIVE: Due to the increased demand for palliative care (PC) in recent years, a model has been proposed to divide PC into primary PC and specialist PC. This article aimed to delineate the indications for primary and specialist PC within 2 common neurosurgical conditions-glioblastoma (GBM) and stroke. METHODS: A systematic review and bibliometric analysis was conducted to better appreciate the practice trends in PC utilization for GBM and stroke patients using several databases. RESULTS: There were 70 studies on PC for GBM, the majority of which related to patient preference (22 [31%]). During 1999-2022, there was significant growth in publications per year on this topic at a rate of approximately 0.3 publications per year (P < 0.01). There were 44 studies on PC for stroke, the majority of which related to communication strategies (14 [32%]). During 1999-2022, there was no significant growth in stroke publications per year (P = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: Due to the progressively disabling neurological course of GBM, we suggest that a specialty PC team be used in conjunction with the neurosurgical team early in the disease trajectory while patients are still able to communicate their preferences, goals, and values. In contrast, short-term and long-term stages of management of stroke have differing implications for PC needs, with the short-term stage necessitating adept, time-sensitive communication between the patient, family, and care teams. Thus, we propose that primary PC should be included as a core competency in neurosurgery training, among other stroke specialists.",0
Nonpharmacologic and Pharmacologic Treatments of Adults in the Acute Phase of Major Depressive Disorder: A Living Clinical Guideline From the American College of Physicians.,"DESCRIPTION: The purpose of this guideline from the American College of Physicians (ACP) is to present updated clinical recommendations on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions as initial and second-line treatments during the acute phase of a major depressive disorder (MDD) episode, based on the best available evidence on the comparative benefits and harms, consideration of patient values and preferences, and cost. METHODS: The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on an updated systematic review of the evidence. AUDIENCE AND PATIENT POPULATION: The audience for this guideline includes clinicians caring for adult patients in the acute phase of MDD in ambulatory care. The patient population includes adults in the acute phase of MDD. RECOMMENDATION 1A: ACP recommends monotherapy with either cognitive behavioral therapy or a second-generation antidepressant as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder (strong recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence). RECOMMENDATION 1B: ACP suggests combination therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy and a second-generation antidepressant as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The informed decision on the options of monotherapy with cognitive behavioral therapy versus second-generation antidepressants or combination therapy should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences. RECOMMENDATION 2: ACP suggests monotherapy with cognitive behavioral therapy as initial treatment in patients in the acute phase of mild major depressive disorder (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). RECOMMENDATION 3: ACP suggests one of the following options for patients in the acute phase of moderate to severe major depressive disorder who did not respond to initial treatment with an adequate dose of a second-generation antidepressant: • Switching to or augmenting with cognitive behavioral therapy (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence) • Switching to a different second-generation antidepressant or augmenting with a second pharmacologic treatment (see Clinical Considerations) (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence) The informed decision on the options should be personalized and based on discussion of potential treatment benefits, harms, adverse effect profiles, cost, feasibility, patients' specific symptoms (such as insomnia, hypersomnia, or fluctuation in appetite), comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and patient preferences.",0
The heterogeneity of public preferences for the first healthcare visit: A discrete choice experiment in the context of Vietnam.,"Primary healthcare is critical in addressing the main health problems of communities. In Vietnam, the increasing healthcare demands cause major challenges, especially overcrowding. This study identified public preferences regarding the selection of healthcare facilities for first visit. A discrete choice online survey was generated from five attributes including visit duration, travel time, personal connection with medical staff, doctors' experience, and health insurance. A D(z) -efficient design constructed 36 choice sets, divided into three blocks of 12 choice sets. Each block formed one version of the questionnaire, which was randomly distributed to the participants. Heterogeneity in participant preferences was analysed by a latent class model with socio demographic characteristics and experiences of the last visit. 822 participants valued doctors' experience for both minor and severe symptoms. Preference heterogeneity for minor symptoms was quick service provision, highly experienced doctors, and payment through health insurance for the first (44.18%), second (32.17%), and third classes (23.66%), respectively. Regarding severe symptoms, they favoured all five attributes, quick health service, and reduced travel time for the first, second, and third classes, respectively (heterogeneities of 58.16%, 27.79%, and 14.05%, respectively). Predictions of choice from the worst to optimal healthcare facility scenario were 8.91%-61.91% and 10.16%-69.83% for minor and severe symptoms, respectively. Knowledge regarding public preference heterogeneity supports policymakers increase public acceptance in choosing primary healthcare facilities. Visit duration and doctors' experience should be considered a priority in decision making.",1
Ethics of the algorithmic prediction of goal of care preferences: from theory to practice.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are quickly gaining ground in healthcare and clinical decision-making. However, it is still unclear in what way AI can or should support decision-making that is based on incapacitated patients' values and goals of care, which often requires input from clinicians and loved ones. Although the use of algorithms to predict patients' most likely preferred treatment has been discussed in the medical ethics literature, no example has been realised in clinical practice. This is due, arguably, to the lack of a structured approach to the epistemological, ethical and pragmatic challenges arising from the design and use of such algorithms. The present paper offers a new perspective on the problem by suggesting that preference predicting AIs be viewed as sociotechnical systems with distinctive life-cycles. We explore how both known and novel challenges map onto the different stages of development, highlighting interdisciplinary strategies for their resolution.",0
Outcomes of Operative Versus Nonoperative Management for Hallux Rigidus: A Tertiary Care Center Experience.,"Background This study aims to investigate and report the outcomes of various management modalities used for hallux rigidus, a common form of degenerative joint disease affecting the foot and ankle. The research focuses on understanding the pathophysiology, classification systems, and nonoperative approaches such as medical therapy, intra-articular injections, shoe modifications, and physical therapy. Surgical techniques, including joint-sparing and joint-sacrificing procedures, are explored, considering factors such as disease stage and patient preferences. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), Riyadh. The study included all patients who were diagnosed with hallux rigidus from the period 2016 to 2022. Data were collected through the BESTCare system at KAMC. All the data were collected through Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) and transferred for analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25 (Released 2017; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York). Frequencies and percentages were used to detail categorical variables, whereas continuous variables were examined by the mean and standard deviation. A p-value of <0.05 was considered to report the statistical significance. Results A total of 84 patients were included. The majority were women (60.7%). Diabetes and hypertension were prevalent comorbidities, affecting 21.4% and 35.7% of patients, respectively. Nonoperative management was the most common approach (66.7%). Complications were minimal (2.4% infections, 1.2% metatarsalgia), and 67.9% of patients reported no persistence of symptoms after treatment. Conclusion The low complication rates and the lack of significant associations between treatment modalities and outcomes suggest the generally safe and effective nature of the employed interventions. These findings can guide clinicians in making informed decisions regarding the management of hallux rigidus, while also highlighting areas for further research to improve treatment strategies and outcomes.",0
What drives poor quality of care for child diarrhea? Experimental evidence from India.,"Most health care providers in developing countries know that oral rehydration salts (ORS) are a lifesaving and inexpensive treatment for child diarrhea, yet few prescribe it. This know-do gap has puzzled experts for decades. Using randomized experiments in India, we estimated the extent to which ORS underprescription is driven by perceptions that patients do not want ORS, provider's financial incentives, and ORS stock-outs (out-of-stock events). Patients expressing a preference for ORS increased ORS prescribing by 27 percentage points. Eliminating stock-outs increased ORS provision by 7 percentage points. Removing financial incentives did not affect ORS prescribing on average but did increase ORS prescribing at pharmacies. We estimate that perceptions that patients do not want ORS explain 42% of underprescribing, whereas stock-outs and financial incentives explain only 6 and 5%, respectively.",0
A discrete choice experiment on oral and injection treatment preferences among moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients in Japan.,"Long-term psoriasis (PsO) management remains challenging. With growing variation in treatment efficacy, cost, and modes of administration, patient preferences for different treatment characteristics are not well understood. A discrete choice experiment (DCE), informed by qualitative patient interviews, was conducted to assess patient preferences for different attributes of PsO treatments; 222 adult patients with moderate-to-severe PsO receiving systemic therapy participated in the DCE web survey. Better long-term efficacy and lower cost were preferred (preference weights p < 0.05). Long-term efficacy had the highest relative importance (RI) and mode of administration was as important as the outcome attributes (efficacy and safety). Patients also preferred oral to injectable administration. In subgroup analyses by disease severity, residence, psoriatic arthritis as a comorbidity, and gender, the trends for each subgroup were the same as the overall population although the extent of RI for administration mode varied. Mode of administration was more important for patients with moderate versus severe disease, or rural versus urban residence. This DCE utilized attributes related to both oral and injectable treatment as well as a broad study population of systemic treatment users. Preferences were further stratified by patient characteristics to explore trends in different subgroups. Understanding the RI of treatment attributes and the attribute trade-offs acceptable to patients helps inform moderate-to-severe PsO systemic treatments decisions.",1
Promoting Informed Decisions About Colorectal Cancer Screening in Older Adults (PRIMED Study): a Physician Cluster Randomized Trial.,"BACKGROUND: For adults aged 76-85, guidelines recommend individualizing decision-making about whether to continue colorectal cancer (CRC) testing. These conversations can be challenging as they need to consider a patient's CRC risk, life expectancy, and preferences. OBJECTIVE: To promote shared decision-making (SDM) for CRC testing decisions for older adults. DESIGN: Two-arm, multi-site cluster randomized trial, assigning physicians to Intervention and Comparator arms. Patients were surveyed shortly after the visit to assess outcomes. Analyses were intention-to-treat. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Primary care physicians affiliated with 5 academic and community hospital networks and their patients aged 76-85 who were due for CRC testing and had a visit during the study period. INTERVENTIONS: Intervention arm physicians completed a 2-h online course in SDM communication skills and received an electronic reminder of patients eligible for CRC testing shortly before the visit. Comparator arm received reminders only. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was patient-reported SDM Process score (range 0-4 with higher scores indicating more SDM); secondary outcomes included patient-reported discussion of CRC screening, knowledge, intention, and satisfaction with the visit. KEY RESULTS: Sixty-seven physicians (Intervention n=34 and Comparator n=33) enrolled. Patient participants (n=466) were on average 79 years old, 50% with excellent or very good self-rated overall health, and 66% had one or more prior colonoscopies. Patients in the Intervention arm had higher SDM Process scores (adjusted mean difference 0.36 (95%CI (0.08, 0.64), p=0.01) than in the Comparator arm. More patients in the Intervention arm reported discussing CRC screening during the visit (72% vs. 60%, p=0.03) and had higher intention to follow through with their preferred approach (58.0% vs. 47.1, p=0.03). Knowledge scores and visit satisfaction did not differ significantly between arms. CONCLUSION: Physician training plus reminders were effective in increasing SDM and frequency of CRC testing discussions in an age group where SDM is essential. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03959696).",0
The Ratings Game: Demographic and Practice Factors Affecting Yelp Ratings of Plastic Surgeons.,"BACKGROUND: Review platforms such as Yelp are increasingly used by patients establishing care and may contain substantial information regarding patient preferences and potential biases. The authors' aims were to (1) analyze patient satisfaction through identifying factors associated with positive and negative patient reviews for plastic surgery providers across the United States, and (2) investigate the association between overall rating and different physician and practice factors based on gender and race. METHODS: Reviews of plastic surgery provider practices from cities across seven different regions within the United States were obtained from Yelp. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed. Chi-square tests were used to determine whether race or sex was associated with overall rating (of five stars) and qualitative themes. RESULTS: A total of 5210 reviews met inclusion criteria; 80.3% received a five-star rating and 13.5% received a one-star rating. Positive Yelp reviews and higher ratings were associated with positive comments regarding surgical and injectable outcomes, physical examination, communication, competency/knowledge base, temperament, scheduling, and staff interactions. When the following factors were mentioned negatively, the practice was more likely to receive a lower rating: temperament, communication, cost consciousness, surgical and injectable outcomes, physical examination, billing/insurance, scheduling, interactions with staff, and wait times. No association was identified in terms of overall physician rating based on sex or race; however, there were differences noted in distribution of positive and negative themes. CONCLUSIONS: Patient reviews on Yelp indicate that several physician and practice factors influence patient satisfaction. The themes reported in this study may be used by plastic surgery providers to identify areas for practice improvement to enhance the overall patient experience.",0

Patient preferences in treatment options of ulcerative colitis: a discrete choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Since the number of medical treatment options for Ulcerative Colitis (UC) has expanded over the last decades, patients and physicians face challenges regarding decisions about the medication options. We aimed to identify patients' preferences about their UC treatment options in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we assessed after how many failed treatment options, patients are willing to consider surgical treatment. METHODS: We conducted a web-based, multicenter, discrete choice experiment (DCE) among adult UC patients. Patients were repeatedly asked to choose between two hypothetical medicinal treatment options. The choice tasks were based on administration route, administration location, chance of symptom reduction (on short and long term) and chances on infection and other adverse events. Data were analyzed by using Hierarchical Bayes estimation. RESULTS: A total of 172 UC patients participated in the DCE. More than half were anti-TNF experienced (52.9%). The chance of symptom reduction after one year (relative importance (RI) 27.7 (95% CI 26.0-29.4)) was most important in choosing between medicinal treatments, followed by the chance of infection (RI 22.3 (21.4 - 23.3)) and chance of symptom reduction after eight weeks (RI 19.5 (18.3 - 20.6)). Considering surgical treatment, nineteen patients (14.3%) would not even consider surgery after failing eight treatment options without any new available therapies left. Nine patients would consider surgery before trying any treatment options. CONCLUSION: We found that symptom reduction after one year was the most important attribute in choosing between treatments in UC patients. These outcomes can help understand the trade-offs and preferences of UC patients.",1
Exploring women's strong preference for women surgeons in breast healthcare.,"BACKGROUND: This study challenges the prevalent belief that surgical roles demand masculine traits, potentially limiting women's suitability for such positions. Contrary to this stereotype, we explored the hypothesis that in sensitive surgical procedures, where communal traits are valued, women patients might favor women surgeons. Two experimental studies investigated women's preferences for a man versus a woman surgeon in a breast exam and breast surgery. METHODS: In two studies we experimentally tested women's preferences for a man versus a woman surgeon for a breast exam (a noninvasive and non-complicated procedure), and breast surgery (an invasive and more complicated procedure). Study 2 delved into factors influencing these preferences, including patients' age, stereotypical perceptions of women surgeons as communal/warm, past negative experiences with men and women doctors, and previous body-related trauma. RESULTS: Women consistently preferred a woman surgeon for both procedures and expressed increased willingness to wait for an appointment with a woman surgeon. However, this preference was less pronounced for surgery than for an exam. Study 2 identified the stereotypical perception of women surgeons as communal/warm as the strongest predictor for this preference, along with previous negative experiences with men doctors and age. CONCLUSIONS: While some gender bias persists, this study underscores a notable preference for women surgeons in intimate medical services like breast exams or surgery. This preference holds practical implications for healthcare providers encouraging women's preventive checkups and offers insights for women medical students making residency choices.",0
Defining Need Amid Exponential Change: Conceptual Challenges in Workforce Planning for Clinical Genetic Services.,"Rapid growth in the volume of referrals to clinical genetics services in many countries during the past 15 years makes workforce planning a critical policy tool in ensuring that the capacity of the clinical genetics workforce is large enough to meet current and future needs. This article explores the distinctive challenges of workforce planning in clinical genetics and provides recommendations for addressing these challenges using a needs-based planning approach. Specifically, at least 3 features complicate efforts to estimate the need for clinical genetic services: the difficulty in linking many clinical genetic services to concrete health outcomes; the rapidly changing nature of genetic medicine, which creates intrinsic uncertainty about the appropriate level of service; and the heightened relevance of patient preferences in this context. Our recommendations call for needs-based planning studies to include an explicit definition of necessary care, to be flexible in considering nonhealth benefits, to err on the side of including services currently funded by health systems even when evidence about outcomes is limited, and to use scenario analysis and expert input to explore the impact of uncertainty about patients' preferences and future technologies on estimates of workforce requirements.",0
Cost effectiveness of using trastuzumab biosimilars compared to trastuzumab original drugs to treat breast cancer in a hospital setting.,"INTRODUCTION: Subcutaneous (SC) drug administration, such as the Herceptin® in an oncology day hospital reduces the administration time of trastuzumab. In the context of combination therapy administration, this time-saving may be called into question. The challenge posed by the deployment of much less expensive IV biosimilar forms raises questions about the cost-effectiveness of SC administration. METHODS: Using data from a french Diagnostic Related Groups regarding prescriptions of intravenous Herceptin® (HIV), Herceptin® biosimilar IV (BSIV), and Herceptin® subcutaneous (HSC), we conducted two simulations. This simulation involved replacing all HSC with BSIV in combination therapy administration (Simulation 1) and subsequently substituting IV forms with SC forms only when prescribed as monotherapy (Simulation 2). A cost-benefit analysis was conducted based on these two simulations, from the hospital's perspective, for Normandy's population over a 1-year timeframe. RESULTS: In Simulation 1, there was an average cost-saving of €12 per patient per year, but it resulted in a loss of 10140 min, equivalent to 10 min per patient per year when compared to the current situation. Simulation 2 yielded average cost-savings for the hospital amounting to €51 per patient per year, along with a time-saving of 67 min per patient per year compared to the current situation. CONCLUSIONS: The development of a program aimed at optimizing the prescription of Trastuzumab holds the potential to deliver significant cost-savings to hospitals while enhancing the quality of service provided to the patients. This optimization involves using H SC in monotherapy and BS IV in combination therapy administration.",0
Implementing Shared Decision-Making for Multiple Sclerosis: The MS-SUPPORT Tool.,"BACKGROUND: Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) offer opportunities to improve the course of multiple sclerosis (MS), but decisions about treatment are difficult. People with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) want more involvement in decisions about DMTs, but new approaches are needed to support shared decision-making (SDM) because of the number of treatment options and the range of outcomes affected by treatment. We designed a patient-centered tool, MS-SUPPORT, to facilitate SDM for pwMS. We sought to evaluate the feasibility and impact of MS-SUPPORT on decisions about disease modifying treatments (DMTs), SDM processes, and quality-of-life. METHODS: This multisite randomized controlled trial compared the SDM intervention (MS-SUPPORT) to control (usual care) over a 12-month period. English-speaking adults with relapsing MS were eligible if they had an upcoming MS appointment and an email address. To evaluate clinician perspectives, participants' MS clinicians were invited to participate. Patients were referred between November 11, 2019 and October 23, 2020 by their MS clinician or a patient advocacy organization (the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America). MS-SUPPORT is an online, interactive, evidence-based decision aid that was co-created with pwMS. It clarifies patient treatment goals and values and provides tailored information about MS, DMTs, and adherence. Viewed by patients before their clinic appointment, MS-SUPPORT generates a personalized summary of the patient's treatment goals and preferences, adherence, DMT use, and clinical situation to share with their MS clinician. Outcomes (DMT utilization, adherence, quality-of-life, and SDM) were assessed at enrollment, post-MS-SUPPORT, post-appointment, and quarterly for 1 year. RESULTS: Participants included 501 adults with MS from across the USA (84.6% female, 83% white) and 34 of their MS clinicians (47% neurologists, 41% Nurse Practitioners, 12% Physician Assistants). Among the 203 patients who completed MS-SUPPORT, most (88.2%) reported they would recommend it to others and that it helped them talk to their doctor (85.2%), understand their options (82.3%) and the importance of taking DMTs as prescribed (82.3%). Among non-users of DMTs at baseline, the probability ratio of current DMT use consistently trended higher over one-year follow-up in the MS-SUPPORT group (1.30 [0.86-1.96]), as did the cumulative probability of starting a DMT within 6-months, with shorter time-to-start (46 vs 90 days, p=0.24). Among the 222 responses from 34 participating clinicians, more clinicians in the MS-SUPPORT group (vs control) trended towards recommending their patient start a DMT (9 of 108 (8%) vs 5 of 109 (5%), respectively, p=0.26). Adherence (no missed doses) to daily-dosed DMTs was higher in the MS-SUPPORT group (81.25% vs 56.41%, p=.026). Fewer patients forgot their doses (p=.046). The MS-SUPPORT group (vs control) reported 1.7 fewer days/month of poor mental health (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: MS-SUPPORT was strongly endorsed by patients and is feasible to use in clinical settings. MS-SUPPORT increased the short-term probability of taking and adhering to a DMT, and improved long-term mental health. Study limitations include selection bias, response bias, social desirability bias, and recall bias. Exploring approaches to reinforcement and monitoring its implementation in real-world settings should provide further insights into the value and utility of this new SDM tool.",0
Rivaroxaban versus Apixaban for Treatment of Cancer-Associated Venous Thromboembolism in Patients at Lower Risk of Bleeding.,"This retrospective study, utilizing U.S. electronic health record (EHR) data from January 2013 to December 2020, sought to assess whether rivaroxaban and apixaban had similar effectiveness and safety in the treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with a cancer type not associated with a high risk of bleeding. We included adults diagnosed with active cancer, excluding esophageal, gastric, unresected colorectal, bladder, noncerebral central nervous system cancers and leukemia, who experienced VTE and received a therapeutic VTE dose of rivaroxaban or apixaban on day 7 post-VTE, and were active in the EHR ≥12 months prior to the VTE. Primary outcome was the composite of recurrent VTE or any bleed resulting in hospitalization at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included recurrent VTE, any bleed resulting in hospitalization, any critical organ bleed, and composites of these outcomes at 3 and 6 months. Inverse probability of treatment-weighted Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We included 1,344 apixaban and 1,093 rivaroxaban patients. At 3 months, rivaroxaban was found to have similar hazard to apixaban for developing recurrent VTE or any bleed resulting in hospitalization (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.60-1.27). No differences were observed between cohorts for this outcome at 6 months (HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.71-1.40) or for any other outcome at 3 or 6 months. In conclusion, patients receiving rivaroxaban or apixaban showed similar risks of the composite of recurrent VTE or any bleed resulting in hospitalization in patients with cancer-associated VTE. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT05461807. Key Points Rivaroxaban and apixaban have similar effectiveness and safety for treatment of cancer-associated VTE through 6 months.Clinicians should therefore consider patient preference and adherence when choosing the optimal anticoagulant.",0

Psoriasis patient preferences for the use of biologics during the coronavirus era.,"Understanding patient preferences concerning the use of biologics for psoriasis treatment can support proper treatment selection to satisfy their needs. In Japan, limited studies have reported psoriasis patients' preferences for the use of biologics, and many of those focused on the improvement of skin symptoms. The present study was conducted as a web-based questionnaire survey using the discrete choice experiment approach to investigate the preferences of psoriasis patients for the use of biologics, as well as to describe social and clinical factors that influence these preferences. The following attributes were selected for the discrete choice experiment: efficacy at 1 year, risk of serious infections requiring hospitalization, incidence of injection site reactions, administration route and visits, co-payment, indications, and efficacy on skin symptoms and other manifestations (the last two have not been evaluated in previous studies). Data were collected from October 4 to October 8, 2021. An analysis of data from 357 psoriasis patients indicated that the most preferred attributes for biologics selection were administration route and visits, followed by the risk of serious infections requiring hospitalization. Some differences were observed among specific subgroups. This study demonstrated that patients with psoriasis prefer biologics with a less frequent administration route and visit schedule and a lower risk of serious infections requiring hospitalization, which contrasts with the results obtained in previous studies where the highest importance was placed on drug effectiveness. These results may reflect the personal and social impact of the coronavirus disease outbreak at the time of the survey. The results of this study might help physicians properly select biologics that satisfy psoriasis patients' needs, leading to better treatment adherence.",1

Policy Preferences Regarding Health Data Sharing Among Patients With Cancer: Public Deliberations.,"BACKGROUND: Precision health offers the promise of advancing clinical care in data-driven, evidence-based, and personalized ways. However, complex data sharing infrastructures, for-profit (commercial) and nonprofit partnerships, and systems for data governance have been created with little attention to the values, expectations, and preferences of patients about how they want to be engaged in the sharing and use of their health information. We solicited patient opinions about institutional policy options using public deliberation methods to address this gap. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand the policy preferences of current and former patients with cancer regarding the sharing of health information collected in the contexts of health information exchange and commercial partnerships and to identify the values invoked and perceived risks and benefits of health data sharing considered by the participants when formulating their policy preferences. METHODS: We conducted 2 public deliberations, including predeliberation and postdeliberation surveys, with patients who had a current or former cancer diagnosis (n=61). Following informational presentations, the participants engaged in facilitated small-group deliberations to discuss and rank policy preferences related to health information sharing, such as the use of a patient portal, email or SMS text messaging, signage in health care settings, opting out of commercial data sharing, payment, and preservation of the status quo. The participants ranked their policy preferences individually, as small groups by mutual agreement, and then again individually in the postdeliberation survey. RESULTS: After deliberation, the patient portal was ranked as the most preferred policy choice. The participants ranked no change in status quo as the least preferred policy option by a wide margin. Throughout the study, the participants expressed concerns about transparency and awareness, convenience, and accessibility of information about health data sharing. Concerns about the status quo centered around a lack of transparency, awareness, and control. Specifically, the patients were not aware of how, when, or why their data were being used and wanted more transparency in these regards as well as greater control and autonomy around the use of their health data. The deliberations suggested that patient portals would be a good place to provide additional information about data sharing practices but that over time, notifications should be tailored to patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests the need for increased disclosure of health information sharing practices. Describing health data sharing practices through patient portals or other mechanisms personalized to patient preferences would minimize the concerns expressed by patients about the extent of data sharing that occurs without their knowledge. Future research and policies should identify ways to increase patient control over health data sharing without reducing the societal benefits of data sharing.",0
"Patient preferences do matter: a discrete choice experiment conducted with breast cancer patients in six European countries, with latent class analysis.","OBJECTIVES: The evolution of breast cancer (BC) treatments has resulted in tailored therapies for the different types and stages of BC. Each treatment has a profile of benefits and adverse effects which are taken into consideration when planning a treatment pathway. This study examines whether patients' preferences are in line with what is considered important from decision makers viewpoint. METHODS: An online discrete choice experiment was conducted in six European countries (France, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Spain, UK) with BC patients. Six attributes were included: overall survival (OS), hyperglycemia, rash, pain, functional well-being (FWB), and out-of-pocket payment (OOP). Sixteen choice sets with two hypothetical treatments and a ""No treatment"" option were presented. Data were analyzed with the use of heteroscedastic conditional, mixed logistic, and latent class models. Marginal rate of substitution (MRS) were estimated for OOP versus the rest of attributes to establish the ranking of preferences for each attribute. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-seven patients with advanced or metastatic BC and 314 with early-stage BC responded. Forty-nine percent of patients were < 44 years old and 65 percent had completed university education. The MRS of the analysis demonstrated that ""severe pain"" is the highest dis-preferred attribute level, followed by ""severe impairment in FWB"" and OS. Four classes of patients as ""decision makers"" were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that there is heterogeneity in treatment preferences of BC patients depending on their sociodemographic and disease-related characteristics. In combination with clinical guidelines, patient preferences can support the selection and tailoring of treatment options.",1
Endovascular Management of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Due to the risk of cerebral hemorrhage, and its related morbidity-mortality, brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are a rare and potentially life-threatening disease. Despite this, there is only one randomized controlled trial on bAVM management, A Randomized trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous malformations (ARUBA). The results of the ARUBA trial favor a noninterventional approach in the case of an unruptured bAVM; however, implementation of these findings is challenging in daily practice. Instead, management of bAVM relies on multidisciplinary discussions that lead to patient-specific strategies based on patient preferences, local expertise, and experience in referral centers. Considering the diverse patterns of presentation and numerous treatment modalities, implementing standardized guidelines in this context proves challenging, notwithstanding the recommendations or expert opinions offered. Endovascular treatment (EVT) of bAVM can be curative, or can serve as an adjunct treatment prior to surgery or radiosurgery (""pre-EVT""). EVT practice is in constant evolution (i.e., venous approach, combination with surgery during the same anesthesia, etc.). Liquid embolic agents such as ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) copolymer and cyanoacrylates (CYA), and their method of injection to increase bAVM occlusion have also benefited from technical evolutions such as the use of adjunctive flow arrest techniques (mini balloons, pressure cooker technique, and multiple catheters). Further research is necessary to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of EVT for bAVM.",0
Hospital-based spiritual care: what matters to patients?,"Demographic changes in Australia have led to an increase in both religious diversity and the number of people who do not nominate a faith affiliation at hospital admission. Models of chaplaincy have shifted from clerical and largely male to an increasingly skilled and diverse spiritual care workforce appointed directly by health services. This study uses survey and in-depth interview methods at an inner-city Australian hospital to examine patient preferences for hospital chaplaincy provided by faith communities, and the importance of faith affiliation compared to other spiritual care provider characteristics. Survey results indicate that of 110 respondents, a high proportion (74%) prefer spiritual care to be provided by a person of the same faith. However, when considered relative to other characteristics, faith affiliation was not as important as kindness, listening skills and a non-judgmental attitude. Our findings have implications for workforce planning and educating. Further research in different settings and with different populations will make the findings more generalizable.",0
Stakeholder Engagement in Designing Attributes for a Discrete Choice Experiment With Policy Implications: An Example of 2 Swiss Studies on Healthcare Delivery.,"OBJECTIVES: The use of discrete choice experiments (DCEs) has become increasingly popular in health policy development by involving and analyzing the preferences of target groups for different aspects of the policy intervention. In this article, we aim to contribute to the standardization of the process of attribute and attribute level development for DCEs with policy relevance. To do so, we propose and empirically illustrate a framework tool for the development and reporting of attributes and attribute levels, with the systematic engagement of relevant stakeholders. METHODS: The framework tool was kept general to allow its use as a standard reporting approach on the development process of a DCE, involving relevant stakeholders at each stage. The proposed 3-stage process consists of (1) collection, (2) selection, and (3) refinement of the DCE attributes and attribute levels. The application of the framework tool is illustrated by 2 projects, Health2040 and COCONUTS-both concerning the preferences of the Swiss population for the future organization of healthcare. RESULTS: By engaging stakeholders, we identified and included attributes and attribute levels that would not have been identified solely through the existing literature. In addition, including multiple stakeholders from different professional backgrounds ensured that the selected attributes and attribute levels were policy relevant, were applicable in practice, and reflected the opinions of multiple actors in healthcare. CONCLUSION: The proposed framework helps to strengthen the standardization of the reporting on attribute and attribute level development with stakeholder engagement and to guide future research teams designing a DCE with policy implications.",1
Clinical Practices Surrounding the Prescription of Home Oxygen in Patients With COPD and Desaturation.,"PURPOSE: While home oxygen therapy increases survival in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have severe resting hypoxemia, recent evidence suggests that there is no survival benefit of home oxygen for patients with COPD who have isolated exertional desaturation. We aimed to understand clinician practice patterns surrounding the prescription of home oxygen for patients with COPD. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews via videoconference with 15 physicians and 3 nurse practitioners who provide care for patients with COPD. Clinicians were recruited through the American Lung Association Airways Clinical Research Centers. Interview guides were created with the assistance of patient investigators and included questions regarding clinician practices surrounding the prescription of oxygen for patients with COPD and the use of clinical guidelines. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded for themes. RESULTS: Of the 18 clinician interviewees, one-third were women, with most participants (n=11) being < 50 years old. Results of the semi-structured interviews suggested research evidence, clinical experience, and patient preferences contributed to clinician decision-making. Most clinicians described a shared decision-making process for prescribing home oxygen for patients, including discussion of risks and benefits, and developing an understanding of patient values and preferences. Clinicians did not use a structured tool to conduct these conversations. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians consider a number of patient and clinical factors when prescribing home oxygen therapy, often using a shared decision-making process. Tools to support shared decision-making about the use of home oxygen are needed.",0
Endometrial ablation techniques in treating menorrhagia.,"Menorrhagia is a frequent gynecological problem that is clinically described as excessive blood loss of 80 mL per menstrual cycle. It has the potential to lower their quality of life and to induce anemia. Medical therapy has typically been the first line of treatment; however, it is frequently ineffectual. Hysterectomy, on the other hand, is clearly 100 percent effective in stopping bleeding, but it is more expensive and can cause serious problems. So, the endometrial ablation is preferred when the endometrial layer is destroyed or removed during the procedure. To ""ablate"" (remove) the endometrial lining, a variety of procedures has been devised. The gold standard resectoscopic procedures (laser, transcervical endometrial resection, and rollerball) require hysteroscopic visualization of the uterus and while safe, necessitate expert surgeons. Several innovative procedures have lately been developed, the majority of which may be conducted blindly and take less time. Many nonresectoscopic procedures are still in the process of being developed, refined, and investigated. This article discusses the various techniques and procedures used in endometrial ablation, the importance of the physician using endometrial thinning agents because success rates are higher when thinning agents are used, and the importance of women understanding the complications mainly related to pregnancy. Women should be helped to make informed management decisions by discussing the risks and benefits of each treatment with their consultant. Since there are many treatment options available, with no one option being superior in all respects, patient preference and treatment preferences should be considered when deciding on management.",0
Laparoscopic versus robotic inguinal hernia repair: a single-center case-matched study.,"INTRODUCTION: Robotic inguinal hernia repair (RIHR) is becoming increasingly common and is the minimally invasive alternative to laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR). Thus far, there is little data directly comparing LIHR and RIHR. The purpose of this study will be to compare outcomes for LIHR and RIHR at a single center. METHODS: A prospective institutional hernia database was queried for patients who underwent transabdominal LIHR or RIHR from 2012 to 2020. The patients were then matched based on the surgeon performing the operation (single, expert hernia surgeon) and laterality of repair. Standard descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: There were 282 patients who met criteria for the study, 141 LIHR and 141 RIHR; 32.6% of patients in each group had a bilateral repair (p = 1.00). LIHR patients were slightly younger (54.4 ± 15.6 vs 58.6 ± 13.8; p = 0.03) but similar in terms of BMI (27.1 ± 5.1 vs 29.1 ± 2.1; p = 0.70) and number of comorbidities (2.9 ± 2.5 vs 2.6 ± 2.2; p = 0.59). Operative time was found to be longer in the RIHR group, but when evaluating RIHR at the beginning of the study versus the end of the study, there was a 50-min decrease in operative time (p < 0.01). Recurrence rates were low for both groups (0.7% vs 1.4%; p = 0.38) with mean follow-up time 13.0 ± 13.3 months. There was only one wound infection, which was in the robotic group. No patients required return to the operating room for complications relating to their surgery. There were no 30-day readmissions in the LIHR group and three 30-day readmissions in the RIHR group (p = 0.28). CONCLUSION: LIHR and RIHR are both performed with low morbidity and have comparable overall outcomes. The total charges were increased in the RIHR group. Either LIHR or RIHR may be considered when performing inguinal hernia repair and should depend on surgeon and patient preference; continued evaluation of the outcomes is warranted.",0
Personalizing prevention: Advances in pharmacotherapy for HIV prevention.,"The HIV epidemic continues to pose a significant burden on the healthcare system. Although the incidence of annual new infections is decreasing, health disparities persist and most new infections remain concentrated into different racial, ethnic, and minority groups. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which involves those at high risk of acquiring HIV to take chronic medications to prevent acquisition of the virus, is key to preventing new HIV infections. The purpose of this article is to review medication therapies for PrEP and examine their role in personalizing PrEP in different patient populations. Additionally, new medications currently under development for PrEP are reviewed, as well as treatment as prevention (TasP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). There are currently four medications available for PrEP: the oral options of co-formulated emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) or emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF); injectable long-acting cabotegravir (CAB-LA); and the vaginal ring dapivirine (DPV-VR). FTC/TAF is not currently indicated for persons at risk for HIV through vaginal sex due to lack of studies, but trials are currently ongoing. DPV-VR is available in Zimbabwe and South Africa and has been endorsed by the World Health Organization but is not currently available in the United States. Several agents are also in development for use in PrEP: the novel long-acting injectable lenacapavir, a first-in-class capsid inhibitor, which has no cross-resistance to any existing HIV drug class; the subdermal implant islatravir, a first-in-class translocation inhibitor; and VRC01, a broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) which has been evaluated in proof-of-concept studies that may lead to the development of more potent bnAbs. Overall, PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV infection in high-risk populations. Identifying optimal PrEP regimens in different patient populations is complex and must consider patient-specific factors and medication cost and access considerations. Lastly, providers should consider individual patient preferences with regard to prevention to improve access, retention in care, and adherence.",0
Retreatment rates and postprocedural complications are higher than expected after BPH surgeries: a US healthcare claims and utilization study.,"BACKGROUND: Up to 50% of men over 50 and 80% over 80 are affected by BPH. Shared decision-making regarding BPH treatment options can benefit from an improved understanding of relative risks and benefits for various treatments. METHODS: Data for this longitudinal retrospective population-based cohort study were obtained from a random sample of US Medicare and commercial claims (IBM Watson MarketScan) and restricted to men undergoing BPH surgery (TURP, PVP, PUL, WVTT) from 2015 to 2021 across all sites of service. Retreatments included Holmium laser enucleation and index procedures. Main outcomes were rates of retreatment and procedural complications over 1 year, identified via CPT and ICD-9/10CM codes. Procedural complications that occurred at least 1 day post-index treatment were assessed, as were surgical retreatments with patients who had at least 1 and 5 year's-worth of data. Baseline phenotype characterization did not control for symptomatology and was limited to age, comorbidities, and BMI. Univariate cumulative incidence estimates, cumulative proportion and log-rank tests justified inclusion for covariate (e.g., age, comorbidities) adjustment in Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: 43,147 men diagnosed with BPH underwent 22,629 TURP, 11,392 PVP, 7,529 PUL, and 1,597 WVTT. At 1-year post-index: PUL was associated with the lowest rate of complication (PUL 15%, TURP 17%; PVP 19%, ; WVTT 26%); retreatment rates were not different (TURP 5.3%, PVP 5.3%, PUL 5.9%, WVTT 6.2%). At 5 years post-index: retreatment was lowest for TURP (7.0%) and was not significantly different between PVP and PUL (8.9% and 11.6%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Real-world patients diagnosed with BPH may be selected to undergo one of the various available therapies based on patient preference or baseline phenotype. These therapies, however, are associated with different risks for complications. The results of this study suggest that within one year of BPH surgery, one-in-twenty patients may require retreatment regardless of treatment choice, and for some technologies as many as one-in-four may require treatment for a complication.",0
Remote vs in-person BRCA1/2 non-carriers test disclosure: patients' choice during Covid-19 pandemic restriction.,"During Covid-19 pandemic most hospitals have restricted in-person delivery of non-essential healthcare services, including genetic testing delivery, to slow the spread of the virus. Our Onco-Genetic Service also faced this challenging period and had to re-organize its clinical practice with the use of tele-health. Aim of the present paper is to understand whether and how Covid-19-related changes in medical practice influenced patients' satisfaction about the health service provided. 125 BRCA1/2 non carriers (109/125, 87.2% female and 16/125, 12.8% male) in Istituto Tumori ""Giovanni Paolo II"" of Bari were enrolled. All participants were asked to choose whether they prefer in-person or remote post-test counselling session. Basing on patients' choice, two groups of subjects were composed. One week after the post-test counselling session, participants were phone called and asked to complete: a socio-demographic form, a brief structured interview about their Covid-19 related worries and their satisfaction with the health service provided, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Fear of Covid-19 scale. Qualitative information about patients' choice were also collected. No significant difference about patients' satisfaction with the health service provided emerged between groups. Patients who preferred remote post-test counselling had higher anxiety, worries and fear-of Covid-19 than the others. All remote-counselling subjects preferred tele-genetics because of Covid-19 security, would choose it again and would recommend it to others. Cancer tele-genetics offers good guarantees of comfort and efficacy, but patients' choices are related to personal and psychological variables. The use of tele-genetics has to be a patient's choice.",0
Trajectories of primary health care utilization: a 10-year follow-up after the Swedish Patient Choice Reform of primary health care.,"BACKGROUND: In January 2010, the choice reform was instituted in Swedish primary health care establishing free entry for private primary health care providers and enabling patients to choose freely among primary health care centers. The motivation behind the reform was to improve access to primary care and responsiveness to patient expectations. Reform effects on health care utilization have previously been investigated by using subgroup analyses assuming a pattern of homogeneous subgroups of the population. By using a different methodological approach, the aim of this study was to, from an equity perspective, investigate long term trends of primary health care utilization following the choice reform. METHOD: A closed cohort was created based on register data from Region Skåne, the third most populated region in Sweden, describing individuals' health care utilization between 2007-2017. Using a novel approach, utilization data, measured as primary health care visits, was matched with socioeconomic and geographic determinants, and analyzed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 659,298 individuals were included in the cohort. Sex differences in utilization were recorded to decrease in the older age group and to increase in the younger age group. Multivariable logistic regression showed increasing utilization in older men to be associated with higher socioeconomic position, while in women it was associated with lower socioeconomic position. Furthermore, groups of becoming high utilizers were all associated with lower socioeconomic position and with residence in urban areas. CONCLUSION: The impact of demographic, socioeconomic and geographic determinants on primary health care utilization varies in magnitude and direction between groups of the population. As a result, the increase in utilization as observed in the general population following the choice reform is unevenly distributed between different population groups.",0
Patient perspectives on risk-reducing salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy for ovarian cancer risk-reduction: A systematic review of the literature.,"OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence suggests the fallopian tube as the site of origin of BRCA1/2-associated high-grade ovarian cancers. Several ongoing trials are evaluating salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy (RRSDO) for ovarian cancer risk reduction and patients are beginning to ask their clinicians about this surgical option. This study sought to systematically review the available literature examining patient preferences regarding RRSDO and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) to provide clinicians with an understanding of patient values, concerns, and priorities surrounding ovarian cancer risk-reducing surgery. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PROSPERO No.: CRD42023400690). We searched key electronic databases to identify studies evaluating acceptance and surgical decision-making regarding RRSO and RRSDO among patients with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. RESULTS: The search yielded 239 results, among which six publications met the systematic review inclusion criteria. Acceptance of RRSDO was evaluated in all studies and ranged from 34% to 71%. Factors positively impacting patients' acceptance of RRSDO included: avoidance of surgical menopause, preservation of fertility, concerns about sexual dysfunction, family history of breast cancer, and avoidance of hormone replacement therapy. Factors limiting this acceptance reported by patients included concerns regarding oncologic safety, surgical timing, and surgical complications. CONCLUSION: To date, few studies have explored patient perspectives surrounding RRSDO. Collectively, the limited data available indicate a high level of acceptance among BRCA1/2 carriers, and provides insight regarding both facilitating and limiting factors associated with patient preferences to better equip clinicians in the counseling and support of their patients.",1
Managing the challenge of a small aortic annulus in patients with severe aortic stenosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Small aortic annulus (SAA) poses a challenge in the management of patients with severe aortic stenosis requiring aortic valve replacement - both surgical and transcatheter - since it has been associated with worse clinical outcomes. AREAS COVERED: This review aims to comprehensively summarize the available evidence regarding the management of aortic stenosis in patients with SAA and discuss the current controversies as well as future perspectives in this field. EXPERT OPINION: It is paramount to agree in a common definition for diagnosing and properly treating SAA patients, and for that purpose, multidetector computer tomography is essential. The results of recent trials led to the expansion of transcatheter aortic valve replacement among patients of all the surgical-risk spectrum, and the choice of treatment (transcatheter, surgical) should be based on patient comorbidities, anatomical characteristics, and patient preferences.",0
"Effective growth hormone replacement with once-weekly somapacitan in Japanese children with growth hormone deficiency: Results from REAL4, a phase 3 clinical trial.","OBJECTIVE: Somapacitan is a long-acting growth hormone (GH) derivative developed for the treatment of GH deficiency (GHD). This study evaluates the efficacy and tolerability of somapacitan in Japanese children with GHD after 104 weeks of treatment and after switch from daily GH. DESIGN: Subanalysis on Japanese patients from a randomised, open-labelled, controlled parallel-group phase 3 trial (REAL4, NCT03811535). PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Thirty treatment-naïve patients were randomised 2:1 to somapacitan (0.16 mg/kg/week) or daily GH (0.034 mg/kg/day) up to Week 52, after which all patients received somapacitan. Height velocity (HV; cm/year) at Weeks 52 and 104 were the primary measurements. Additional assessments included HV SD score (SDS), height SDS, bone age, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) SDS, and observer-reported outcomes. RESULTS: At Week 52, observed mean HV was similar between treatment groups (10.3 vs. 9.8 cm/year for somapacitan and daily GH, respectively). Similar HVs between groups were also observed at Week 104: 7.4 cm/year after continuous somapacitan treatment (soma/soma) and 7.9 cm/year after 1-year somapacitan treatment following switch from daily GH (switch). Other height-related endpoints supported continuous growth. IGF-I SDS increased in both groups with mean IGF-I SDS within -2 and +2 during the study. Somapacitan was well tolerated, one mild injection site reaction was reported, with no reports of injection site pain. Patient preference questionnaires showed that most patients and their caregivers (90.9%) who switched treatment at Week 52 preferred once-weekly somapacitan over daily GH treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Somapacitan showed sustained efficacy in Japanese children with GHD over 104 weeks and for 52 weeks after switching from daily GH. Somapacitan was well tolerated and preferred over daily GH.",0
Patient characteristics and preferences for a surgical prehabilitation program design: results from a pilot survey.,"PURPOSE: Surgical prehabilitation aims to reduce a decline in the functional capacity thereby optimising health and fitness before surgery. One of the major barriers in successfully implementing a prehabilitation program in hospitals has been poor patient adherence. In our pilot survey on surgical patients, we sought to explore patient preferences regarding the program design, the barriers and enablers to patient participation in a multimodal prehabilitation program. METHODS: The survey was administered to patients undergoing major abdominal surgery in the preoperative period. The first two parts of the instrument mainly included questions on demographics, social history, activity levels, interest towards prehabilitation program and their involvement in co-design, preferences towards the components of the program, the barriers and enablers. The last part of survey included symptom and physical assessments. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 24 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. The median age of our cohort was 71 (range 35-91) years and 75% were retired. 75% of our participants were extremely interested in improving health and fitness and 63% were very keen to co-design their program when explained. Home-based programs were preferred by most participants and among exercises, walking was preferred by 71% of the participants. One third of the participants were interested in professional dietary counselling. There were only two participants who preferred group psychological therapy while 25% preferred individual psychological counselling sessions. CONCLUSION: Our survey highlighted a need to design a personalised program with tailored interventions due to the wide variation in the interest and preferences among surgical patients.",0

Identifying Patterns in Preoperative Communication about High-Risk Surgical Intervention: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.,"INTRODUCTION: Surgeons are entrusted with providing patients with information necessary for deliberation about surgical intervention. Ideally, surgical consultations generate a shared understanding of the treatment experience and determine whether surgery aligns with a patient's overall health goals. In-depth assessment of communication patterns might reveal opportunities to better achieve these objectives. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of audio-recorded consultations between surgeons and patients considering high-risk surgery. For 43 surgeons, we randomly selected 4 transcripts each of consultations with patients aged ≥60 y with at least 1 comorbidity. We developed a coding taxonomy, based on principles of informed consent and shared decision making, to categorize surgeon speech. We grouped transcripts by treatment plan and recorded the treatment goal. We used box plots, Sankey diagrams, and flow diagrams to characterize communication patterns. RESULTS: We included 169 transcripts, of which 136 discussed an oncologic problem and 33 considered a vascular (including cardiac and neurovascular) problem. At the median, surgeons devoted an estimated 8 min (interquartile range 5-13 min) to content specifically about intervention including surgery. In 85.5% of conversations, more than 40% of surgeon speech was consumed by technical descriptions of the disease or treatment. ""Fix-it"" language was used in 91.7% of conversations. In 79.9% of conversations, no overall goal of treatment was established or only a desire to cure or control cancer was expressed. Most conversations (68.6%) began with an explanation of the disease, followed by explanation of the treatment in 53.3%, and then options in 16.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Explanation of disease and treatment dominate surgical consultations, with limited time spent on patient goals. Changing the focus of these conversations may better support patients' deliberation about the value of surgery.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02623335. HIGHLIGHTS: In decision-making conversations about high-risk surgical intervention, surgeons emphasize description of the patient's disease and potential treatment, and the use of ""fix-it"" language is common.Surgeons dedicated limited time to eliciting patient preferences and goals, and 79.9% of conversations resulted in no explicit goal of treatment.Current communication practices may be inadequate to support deliberation about the value of surgery for individual patients and their families.",0
Decision Making About Disease-Modifying Treatments for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis: Stated Preferences and Real-World Choices.,"BACKGROUND: People with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis can benefit from disease-modifying treatments (DMTs). Several DMTs are available that vary in their efficacy, side-effect profile and mode of administration. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to measure the preferences of people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis for DMTs using a discrete choice experiment and to assess which stated preference attributes correlate with the attributes of the DMTs they take in the real world. METHODS: Discrete choice experiment attributes were developed from literature reviews, interviews and focus groups. In a discrete choice experiment, participants were shown two hypothetical DMTs, then chose whether they preferred one of the DMTs or no treatment. A mixed logit model was estimated from responses and individual-level estimates of participants' preferences conditional on their discrete choice experiment choices calculated. Logit models were estimated with stated preferences predicting current real-world on-treatment status, DMT mode of administration and current DMT. RESULTS: A stated intrinsic preference for taking a DMT was correlated with currently taking a DMT, and stated preferences for mode of administration were correlated with the modes of administration of the DMTs participants were currently taking. Stated preferences for treatment effectiveness and adverse effects were not correlated with real-world behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: There was variation in which discrete choice experiment attributes correlated with participants' real-world DMT choices. This may indicate patient preferences for treatment efficacy/risk are not adequately taken account of in prescribing. Treatment guidelines must ensure they take into consideration patients' preferences and improve communication around treatment efficacy/risk.",1
Surgical Approach to Bilateral Inguinal Hernia. A Case-Control Study.,"Introduction: Bilateral inguinal hernia can be safely repaired simultaneously, open or minimally invasive, in an elective sce-nario. The choice of surgical approach depends on the patient's status, hernia characteristics, surgeons and patient preferences. Whether age criteria should be considered when selecting between the two approaches is still a matter of debate. Considering that there is no consensus regarding the best repair in bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy, the aim of the study is to perform an analysis regarding elective surgical approach of patients with bilateral inguinal hernias. Material and Methods: To study the relationship between exposure to an open versus laparoscopic approach in patients with bilateral inguinal hernia, we conducted a case-control study. In our retrospective analysis, cases (23 patients) were the open-approach hernia repair, and controls (82 patients) were laparoscopic hernia repair. We analyzed two sets of variables: first, related to patient characteristics (age 65 years, BMI 30 kg/m2, smoking habit, HTA status, COPD status, DM status, use of anticoagulants, presence of neoplastic status) and second, variables related to hernia features (inguinoscrotal hernia, recurrent hernia and complicated hernia). Results: The mean age for cases was 73.26 (Ã+-12.99) years and that of controls, was 56.48 (Ã+-15.15) years. Univariate analysis demonstrated four variables with statistical significance: age 65 years, inguinoscrotal hernia, neo-plastic status, and anticoagulant use. When introduced into the multivariate analysis, we noted that only two variables, age 65 years (OR=4.183, 95% CI [1.289, 13.572], p=0.017) and use of anticoagulants (OR=38.876, 95% CI [1.305, 1158.011], p=0.035) reached statistical significance. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that when we refer to bilateral inguinal hernia repair, patients aged 65 years are at risk of having an open procedure at least fourfold more than patients aged 65 years. In addition, the use of anticoagulants increases the risk of open hernia repair 38 times more than that of minimally invasive repair for the same age group. Interestingly, in our study, hernia characteristics were not found to be associated with open hernia repair and age 65 years. In our study we found that age 65 years is associated with electing open hernia repair over minimally invasive repair, which can be linked to age-related risk factors. Further re-search is needed to investigate the impact of age and age-related risk factors on surgical outcomes of bilateral inguinal hernia repair.",0
Preferences for COVID-19 Vaccination in People With Chronic Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases.,"OBJECTIVE: To understand how people with chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) trade off the benefits and risks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine options. METHODS: We conducted an online discrete-choice experiment in people with IMIDs to quantify the relative importance (RI) of attributes relevant to COVID-19 vaccination. Participants were recruited between May and August 2021 through patient groups and clinics in Canada, and completed 10 choices where they selected 1 of 2 hypothetical vaccine options or no vaccine. The RI of each attribute was estimated and heterogeneity was explored through latent class analysis. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 551 people (89% female, mean age 46 yrs) with a range of IMIDs (inflammatory bowel disease [48%], rheumatoid arthritis [38%], systemic lupus erythematosus [16%]). Most had received 1 (94%) or 2 (64%) COVID-19 vaccinations. Across the ranges of levels considered, vaccine effectiveness was most important (RI = 66%), followed by disease flare (21%), rare but serious risks (9%), and number/timing of injections (4%). Patients would accept a risk of disease flare requiring a treatment change of ≤ 8.8% for a vaccine with a small absolute increase in effectiveness (10%). Of the 3 latent classes, the group with the greatest aversion to disease flare were more likely to be male and have lower incomes, but this group still valued effectiveness higher than other attributes. CONCLUSION: Patients perceived the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination to outweigh rare serious risks and disease flare. This supports COVID-19 vaccine strategies that maximize effectiveness, while recognizing the heterogeneity in preferences that exists.",1
Impact of Locus of Control on Patient-Provider Communication: A Systematic Review.,"Growing evidence shows there is heterogeneity in patient communication preferences and a need to tailor communication approaches accordingly. However, little is known about the psychosocial factors that influence communication preferences. Among them is locus of control (LOC), a belief about who or what determines outcomes, including health. Although LOC theory was developed over 60 years ago as a personality theory, its relevance in healthcare has increased over the past two decades. There is a paucity of empirical evidence on patient or provider LOC as it influences communication quality and outcomes in healthcare settings. We conducted a systematic review to collate the current state of the literature.We carried out a comprehensive search of PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Library databases to retrieve relevant peer-reviewed articles. A total of 1152 publications were identified. Our final review included 17 articles that underwent data extraction and quality assessment.The included studies found evidence of LOC associations with several patient and provider communication-related outcomes including satisfaction with care; medical decision-making and communication preferences; adherence; and patient-provider rapport. As opposed to generalized approaches to communication, assessing patient LOC may allow clinicians to tailor their approaches to match patients' LOC. Our findings provide a starting point and highlight the need for future studies.",0
Sequential management of postmenopausal health and osteoporosis: An update.,"Increased life expectancy means that women are now in a hypoestrogenic state for approximately one-third of their lives. Overall health and specifically bone health during this period evolves in accordance with aging and successive exposure to various risk factors. In this review, we provide a summary of the approaches to the sequential management of osteoporosis within an integrative model of care to offer physicians a useful tool to facilitate therapeutic decision-making. Current evidence suggests that pharmacologic agents should be selected based on the risk of fractures, which does not always correlate with age. Due to their effect on bone turnover and on other hormone-regulated phenomena, such as hot flushes or breast cancer risk, we position hormone therapy and selective estrogen receptor modulators as an early postmenopause intervention for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. When the use of these agents is not possible, compelling evidence supports antiresorptive agents as first-line treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in many clinical scenarios, with digestive conditions, kidney function, readiness for compliance, or patient preferences playing a role in choosing between bisphosphonates or denosumab during this period. For patients at high risk of osteoporotic fracture, the ""anabolic first"" approach reduces that risk. The effect on bone health with these bone-forming agents or with denosumab should be consolidated with the subsequent use of antiresorptive agents. Regardless of the strategy, follow-up and treatment should be maintained indefinitely to help prevent fractures.",0
Management strategies for antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction.,"Antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction is one of the most frequently met adverse effects for individuals suffering from major depressive disorder. When primary prevention by non-pharmacological measures fails, empirical coping strategies might be proposed. In this article, we present a brief overview of pharmacological strategies for antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction, considering antidepressants and conceivable corrective medications. We suggest dividing these strategies into three groups: (1) tapering (dose reduction, therapeutic window or short-term treatment interruption); (2) maintenance (focusing on spontaneous remission); (3) optimizing treatment (substitution for another antidepressant or addition of treatments to correct sexual side effects). Whichever strategy is selected, we encourage the clinician to propose the most adequate therapeutic option for the patient, while considering the efficacy and overall tolerance of the current antidepressant strategy, the affected phase of sexuality and patient preferences and gender. This summary is limited to antidepressant treatments and correctors marketed in France and aimed at a clinician reading to help manage patients suffering from antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.",0
Patient Preferences for Cardiac Rehabilitation - A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Although a large number of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation(CR), patient preferences for CR remain unclear. Knowing patient preferences may contribute to increasing patient participation and adherence, thus improving patient prognosis. METHODS: A systematic search was carried out using electronic databases and manual reference checks from inception until 15th June 2022. Quantitative studies, qualitative studies and mixed methods studies assessing patient preferences for CR were included. Two researchers independently conducted study selectionand data extraction. CR preferences were divided into three categories: CR settings, CR components, and CR contents. A narrative synthesis was applied to integrate the results of the included studies. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to assess the quality of included studies. RESULTS: Ultimately, 17 publications were included in this study. Regarding CR settings, most patients preferred the hospital to home, some considered both, and a few were willing to accept the local CR club as an alternative setting to the hospital. For CR components, regardless of age and gender, patients considered exercise training and nutrition counseling to be the most important and smoking cessation to be the least important. In exercise intervention of CR contents, progress discussion and encouragement were rated as most critical, and non-conflicting with other activities was rated as least critical. In psychological intervention of CR contents, most patients were willing to accept psychological intervention, and a few patients wanted to heal the trauma with the passage of time. CONCLUSION: This systematic review provides important insights into patient preferences for CR, clarifying patient preferences for CR settings, components, and contents, along with possible influencing factors. Patient preferences may change due to the COVID-19 epidemic, and there is still a need to focus on patient preferences for CR and conduct more relevant primary research to validate the findings of this paper in the future.",1
Multimodal prehabilitation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing anatomical resection: protocol of a non-randomised feasibility study.,"BACKGROUND: The preoperative period can be used to enhance a patient's functional capacity with multimodal prehabilitation and consequently improve and fasten postoperative recovery. Especially, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) surgical patients may benefit from this intervention, since the affected and resected organ is an essential part of the cardiorespiratory fitness. Drafting a prehabilitation programme is challenging, since many disciplines are involved, and time between diagnosis of NSCLC and surgery is limited. We designed a multimodal prehabilitation programme prior to NSCLC surgery and aimed to conduct a study to assess feasibility and indicative evidence of efficacy of this programme. Publication of this protocol may help other healthcare facilities to implement such a programme. METHODS: The multimodal prehabilitation programme consists of an exercise programme, nutritional support, psychological support, smoking cessation, patient empowerment and respiratory optimisation. In two Dutch teaching hospitals, 40 adult patients with proven or suspected NSCLC will be included. In a non-randomised fashion, 20 patients follow the multimodal prehabilitation programme, and 20 will be assessed in the control group, according to patient preference. Assessments will take place at four time points: baseline, the week before surgery, 6 weeks postoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. Feasibility and indicative evidence of efficacy of the prehabilitation programme will be assessed as primary outcomes. DISCUSSION: Since the time between diagnosis of NSCLC and surgery is limited, it is a challenge to implement a prehabilitation programme. This study will assess whether this is feasible, and evidence of efficacy can be found. The non-randomised fashion of the study might result in a selection and confounding bias. However, the control group may help putting the results of the prehabilitation group in perspective.

Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for cholelithiasis 2021.,"The Japanese Society of Gastroenterology first published evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for cholelithiasis in 2010, followed by a revision in 2016. Currently, the revised third edition was published to reflect recent evidence on the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of cholelithiasis conforming to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Following this revision, the present English version of the guidelines was updated and published herein. The clinical questions (CQ) in the previous version were reviewed and rearranged into three newly divided categories: background questions (BQ) dealing with basic background knowledge, CQ, and future research questions (FRQ), which refer to issues that require further accumulation of evidence. Finally, 52 questions (29 BQs, 19 CQs, and 4 FRQs) were adopted to cover the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, complications, and prognosis. Based on a literature search using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Igaku Chuo Zasshi databases for the period between 1983 and August 2019, along with a manual search of new information reported over the past 5 years, the level of evidence was evaluated for each CQ. The strengths of recommendations were determined using the Delphi method by the committee members considering the body of evidence, including benefits and harms, patient preference, and cost-benefit balance. A comprehensive flowchart was prepared for the diagnosis and treatment of gallbladder stones, common bile duct stones, and intrahepatic stones, respectively. The current revised guidelines are expected to be of great assistance to gastroenterologists and general physicians in making decisions on contemporary clinical management for cholelithiasis patients.",0
Exploring older peoples' attitudes and preferences around the use of their healthcare information.,"AIMS: Routinely collected health data can provide rich information for research and epidemiological monitoring of different diseases, but using the data presents many challenges. This study aims to explore the attitudes and preferences of people aged 55 and over regarding the use of their de-identified health data, and their concerns and comfort in different scenarios. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted with people aged 55 and over currently engaged with health services in a New Zealand health district during June-October 2022. The survey could be completed online or by telephone and was available in eight languages. RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of respondents knew that their health information was currently being used in the ways described in the scenarios, and between 80-87% felt comfortable or very comfortable with their data being used as described in the scenarios. In contrast, 4% (n=9) felt ""uncomfortable"" or ""very uncomfortable"" across all of the scenarios. Participants expressed concerns about data accuracy, privacy and confidentiality, security, transparency of use, consent, feedback and the risk of data being sold to commercial companies. Some participants identified situations where permission should be required to link data, including being used by people other than health professionals, containing sensitive health issues, or being used for commercial purposes. CONCLUSION: This study finds general support from patients for the use of their routinely collected data for secondary purposes as long as its use will benefit the population from which the data are taken. It also highlights the necessity of including the perspectives of different cultures in the collection, storage, use and analysis of health information, particularly concerning Māori cultural considerations.",0
Preferences for onward health data use in the electronic age among maternity patients and providers in South Africa: a qualitative study.,"Despite the expanding digitisation of individual health data, informed consent for the collection and use of health data is seldom explicitly sought in public sector clinics in South Africa. This study aims to identify perceptions of informed consent practices for health data capture, access, and use in Gauteng and the Western Cape provinces of South Africa. Data collection from September to December 2021 included in-depth interviews with healthcare providers (n = 12) and women (n = 62) attending maternity services. Study findings suggest that most patients were not aware that their data were being used for purposes beyond the individualised provision of medical care. Understanding the concept of anonymised use of electronic health data was at times challenging for patients who understood their data in the limited context of paper-based folders and booklets. When asked about preferences for electronic data, patients overwhelmingly were in favour of digitisation. They viewed electronic access to their health data as facilitating rapid and continuous access to health information. Patients were additionally asked about preferences, including delivery of health information, onward health data use, and recontacting. Understanding of these use cases varied and was often challenging to convey to participants who understood their health data in the context of information inputted into their paper folders. Future systems need to be established to collect informed consent for onward health data use. In light of perceived ties to the care received, these systems need to ensure that patient preferences do not impede the content nor quality of care received.",0
Patient preferences and shared decision making for the traditional Chinese medicine treatment of lung cancer: A discrete choice experiment study.,"BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), integrating patient preferences into decision-making process, has been widely used in the multimodality therapy of lung cancer. This study aimed to estimate patient preferences for treatment and shared decision-making (SDM) modes concerning inpatient TCM treatment of lung cancer in Shanghai in order to provide a basis for clinical decision-making process on TCM therapy for lung cancer. METHODS: This study was conducted among patients (n = 347) from nine tertiary hospitals in Shanghai by discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey and Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire-patient version (SDM-Q-9) survey. The DCE was developed with the inclusion of the most relevant attributes at appropriate levels for the TCM treatment of lung cancer. The empirical data analyses of patients were performed using mixed logit models. Additionally, subgroup analysis was conducted. RESULTS: In total, 347 respondents completed the questionnaire. All attributes' coefficients were statistically significant for patients' preferences. Patients showed strong preferences for increasing disease control rate, relieving nausea and vomiting, reducing the risk of side effects, and were concerned about monthly out-of-pocket costs. Subgroup analysis indicated that patients with a lower SDM-Q-9 score and those who were satisfied with medical services emphasized more importance of higher disease control rate. Furthermore, most of the patients (90.20%) self-reported a high willingness to use SDM during the decision-making process. CONCLUSION: In Shanghai, patients mainly preferred SDM and considered disease control rate as the most essential attribute in the TCM treatment of lung cancer. The study findings could underscore the importance of considering patients' preferences and promote SDM.",1
Patient decisions regarding cancer gene panel testing: An exploratory study.,"This study examined factors associated with the selection of a specific multi-gene panel test by patients in a cancer genetic counseling clinic. We surveyed patients who received pre-test genetic counseling at the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Cancer Risk Assessment (CCRA) in 2019 and their genetic counselors to assess demographic and clinical characteristics, patient concerns, and session outcome. Ultimately, 228 eligible participants completed the survey, of whom 85.1% consented to genetic testing. Of those who chose testing, 56.2% selected the largest panel type available, a pan-cancer panel that included both actionable and inactionable genes. White patients were more likely than non-white patients to pursue testing. Among testers, number of testing options offered, participant educational attainment, age, and NCCN Guidelines status were associated with patient choice between four panel options. Some patient concerns, including impact of results on future cancer screening and family dynamics, were also linked to test choice. Several other participant characteristics including income, cancer diagnosis, and family structure did not appear to be predictive of testing choice. Our results confirmed the patient preference for large gene panels and identified a limited number of associations between patient characteristics and concerns and testing choice. We noted however that a significant number of participants did not choose the most commonly selected test, and that test choice is difficult to predict based on clinical and demographic factors. Our results also provide further evidence of well-documented disparities in cancer genetic testing. Study limitations do not allow our findings to be generalized to all cancer genetic counseling patients. Further research is needed to examine how and why patients choose between multiple genetic test options in the cancer setting. This study was one of the first to examine patient choice between a full spectrum of multi-gene panel options.",0
Pretesting Discrete-Choice Experiments: A Guide for Researchers.,"Discrete-choice experiments (DCEs) are a frequently used method to explore the preferences of patients and other decision-makers in health. Pretesting is an essential stage in the design of a high-quality choice experiment and involves engaging with representatives of the target population to improve the readability, presentation, and structure of the preference instrument. The goal of pretesting in DCEs is to improve the validity, reliability, and relevance of the survey, while decreasing sources of bias, burden, and error associated with preference elicitation, data collection, and interpretation of the data. Despite its value to inform DCE design, pretesting lacks documented good practices or clearly reported applied examples. The purpose of this paper is: (1) to define pretesting and describe the pretesting process specifically in the context of a DCE, (2) to present a practical guide and pretesting interview discussion template for researchers looking to conduct a rigorous pretest of a DCE, and (3) to provide an illustrative example of how these resources were operationalized to inform the design of a complex DCE aimed at eliciting tradeoffs between personal privacy and societal benefit in the context of a police method known as investigative genetic genealogy (IGG).",1
Using Patient Preferences in Health Technology Assessment: Evaluating Quality-Adjusted Survival Equivalents (QASE) for the Quantification of Non-health Benefits.,"Interest in using patient preference (PP) data alongside traditional economic models in health technology assessment (HTA) is growing, including using PP data to quantify non-health benefits. However, this is limited by a lack of standardised methods. In this article, we describe a method for using discrete choice experiment (DCE) data to estimate the value of non-health benefits in terms of quality-adjusted survival equivalence (QASE), which is consistent with the concept of value prevalent among HTA agencies. We describe how PP data can be used to estimate QASE, assess the ability to test the face-validity of QASE estimates of changes in mode of administration calculated from five published DCE oncology studies and review the methodological and normative considerations associated with using QASE to support HTA. We conclude that QASE may have some methodological advantages over alternative methods, but this requires DCEs to estimate second-order effects between length and quality of life. In addition, empirical work has yet to be undertaken to substantiate this advantage and demonstrate the validity of QASE. Further work is also required to align QASE with normative objectives of HTA agencies. Estimating QASE would also have implications for the conduct of DCEs, including standardising and defining more clear attribute definitions.",1
Validation of the Korean Version of Patient-Centered Care Tool: For Outpatients.,"AIM: The objective of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of the Korean version of the patient-centered care (K-PCC) instrument for outpatients. The study was conducted due to the absence of a measurement tool specifically designed to evaluate patient-centered care for outpatients. DESIGN: This study is a methodological study to verify the validity and reliability of the Korean version of Patient-Centered Care (K-PCC) to measure patient-centeredness for outpatients. METHODS: As a first step for the evaluation of the tool, the content validity was verified by expert panel. Then, a total of 400 outpatients were recruited, and construct validity was verified through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) as the second step for the evaluation of the tool. The convergent and discriminant validity of the tool was verified by calculating the standardized factor loads, construct reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE), and calculating the correlation square between the factors as the third and fourth steps for the evaluation of the tool. And as a fifth step for the evaluation of the tool, criterion validity was evaluated by comparing the correlation with the patient-centeredness measurement tool for inpatients (PEx-inpatient). In estimating reliability, internal consistency reliability coefficients were calculated. RESULTS: The confirmatory factor analysis supported good fit for the Korean patient-centered care instrument (K-PCC), and the eight-factor structure was validated. The scale comprises 21 items across eight factors: patient preferences (4 items), physical comfort (2 items), coordination of care (2 items), continuity and transition (3 items), emotional support (2 items), access to medical care (3 items), information and education (2 items), and family and friends (3 items). The Cronbach's alphas ranging between 0.73 and 0.88. CONCLUSION: The Korean patient-centered primary care instrument is a valid and reliable scale to measure patient-centered care for outpatients in the Korean medical environment.",0
