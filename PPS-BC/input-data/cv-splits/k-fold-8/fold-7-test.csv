Development of vaccines for Chagas disease (CRUZIVAX): stakeholders' preferences and potential impacts on healthcare.,"A vaccine for Chagas disease does not currently exist. This study aims to inform the development of two vaccines for the prevention and treatment of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and guide their pre-clinical phase up to clinical phase I. The three main objectives are: 1) to explore patients' and policy makers' preferences on the candidate vaccines in Argentina and Spain; 2) to investigate health-related quality of life of patients affected by Chagas disease; and 3) to assess the potential health provider savings associated with the vaccines, in terms of resource use and health care costs. Discrete choice experiments will be employed to estimate and characterize the theoretical demand for the vaccines and investigate patients' and policy makers' preferences. Health-related quality of life will be assessed using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Resources use and costs associated with Chagas disease will be investigated using information from the databases of the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona.",1
Influence of Self-Reported Health Impairments on German EQ-5D-5L Values.,"OBJECTIVES: The German EQ-5D-5L value set is based on the average preferences of the general population. Nevertheless, in Germany, there is an ongoing debate about the appropriateness of using general population preferences and whether patient preferences should be used instead. Thus, this research aimed to determine the robustness of the German EQ-5D-5L valuation data for the general population compared with those with health impairments. METHODS: Subgroups were built on the self-reported quality of life, measured with the EQ-5D-5L. To identify which groups significantly influenced the value set, different regression models, including dummy variables for the subgroups, were tested while controlling for preference heterogeneity. Backward selection based on the Akaike information criterion led to significant subgroup dummies, which were analyzed in more detail. For each significant subgroup, the value set model was estimated separately. The models were then compared. Sociodemographics of the subgroups were considered. RESULTS: Three significant dummies were identified: state 11111, severity levels 5 to 7, and self-reported problems with pain/discomfort. The value sets for the 6 subgroups were compared with the national German value set, showing only marginal deviations. The mean absolute deviation ranged from 0.004 to 0.013. No different densities were identified for the decrements of the different value sets. CONCLUSIONS: People with self-reported health impairments do not have different EQ-5D-5L health state preferences compared with the German general population. Further research is needed to determine whether the presence of a chronic health condition has a larger influence on health state valuation than the general population.",0
Prospective Six-Month Analysis of Multiarea Burst Spinal Cord Stimulation: Correlating Intraoperative Neuromonitoring With Postoperative Programming and Clinical Outcomes.,"INTRODUCTION: DeRidder burst spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has shown superior relief from overall pain to traditional tonic neurostimulation therapies and a reduction in back and leg pain. However, nearly 80% of patients have two or more noncontiguous pain areas. This affects the ability to effectively program stimulation and deliver long-term efficacy of the therapy. Multiple DeRidder burst region programming is an option to treat multisite pain by interleaving stimulation at multiple areas along the spinal cord. Previous intraoperative neuromonitoring studies have shown that DeRidder burst stimulation provides broader myotomal coverage at a lower recruitment threshold. The goal of this study is to correlate intraoperative electromyogram (EMG) threshold and postsynaptic excitability with postoperative paresthesia thresholds and optimal burst stimulation programming. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Neuromonitoring was performed during permanent implant of SCS leads in ten patients diagnosed with chronic intractable back and/or leg pain. Each patient underwent the surgical placement of a Penta Paddle electrode through laminectomy at the T8-T11 spinal levels. Subdermal electrode needles were placed into lower extremity muscle groups, in addition to the rectus abdominis muscles, for EMG recording. Evoked responses were compared across multiple trials of burst stimulation in which the number of independent burst areas was varied. After intraoperative data collection, all patients were programmed with single- and multiarea DeRidder burst. Intermittent dosing was delivered at 30:90, 120:360, 120:720, and 120:1440 (seconds ON/OFF) intervals. Numerical rating scale (NRS) and Patient Global Impression of Change scores were evaluated at one, two, three, four, and six months after permanent implant. RESULTS: The thresholds for EMG recruitment after DeRidder burst differed across all patients owing to anatomical and physiological variations. After a 30-second dose of stimulation, the average decrease in thresholds was 1.25 mA for two-area and 0.9 mA for four-area DeRidder burst. Furthermore, a 30-second dose of multisite DeRidder burst produced a 0.25 mA reduction in the postoperative paresthesia thresholds. Across all patients, the baseline NRS score was 6.5 ± 0.5, and the NRS score after single or multiarea DeRidder burst therapy was 2.87 ± 1.50. Eight of ten patients reported a ≥50% decrease in their pain scores through the six-month follow-up visit. Pain outcomes using intermittent multiarea stimulation with longer OFF times (120:360, 120:720, 120:1440) were comparable to those using single-area DeRidder burst at 30:90 up to six months after implant with patient preference being two-area DeRidder burst. CONCLUSIONS: This study aims to evaluate the use of intraoperative neuromonitoring to optimize stimulation programming for multisite pain and correlate it with postoperative programming and efficacy. These results suggest that multisite programming can be used to further customize DeRidder burst stimulation to each individual patient and improve outcomes and quality of life for patients receiving SCS therapy for multisite pain.",0
A discrete choice experiment to quantify the influence of trial features on the decision to participate in cystic fibrosis trials.,"BACKGROUND: Patient-centred trial design optimises recruitment and retention, reduces trial failure rates and increases the diversity of trial cohorts. This allows safe and effective treatments to reach clinic more quickly. To achieve this, patients' views must be incorporated into trial design. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was used to quantify preferences of pwCF for trials features; medicine type, trial location, stipend, washout, drug access on trial completion and trial design. Respondents were presented pairs of hypothetical trial scenarios with different level combinations assigned through experimental design. Respondents were asked to pick their preferred option or decline both. The cross-sectional data were explored using a Random Parameters Logit model. RESULTS: We received 207 eligible responses between Oct2020-Jan2021. The strongest influence on the decision to participate was trial location; pwCF favour participation at their usual clinical centre. Greater travel distances made respondents less willing to participate. Post-trial drug access ranked second. pwCF would rather participate in modulator trials than trials of other drugs. In general, pwCF did not favour a washout period, but were more prepared to washout non-modulators than modulators. Stipend provision was not ranked highly, but higher stipends increased intention to participate. Trial design (placebo vs open-label) had minimal influence on the decision to participate. There are complex interactions between placebos and washouts. CONCLUSIONS: We used quantitative methods to systematically elicit preferences of pwCF for clinical trials' features. We explore the relevance of our findings to trial design and delivery in the current CF trials landscape.",1
Women's needs for lifestyle risk reduction engagement during the interconception period: a scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Unhealthy lifestyle is responsible for many chronic conditions, and antenatal engagement with women about lifestyle behaviours can be too late to prevent some adverse pregnancy outcomes and subsequent childhood risks. To reduce the risk of future adverse outcomes, the interconception period is an opportunity to implement positive health changes. The aim of this scoping review was to explore women's needs for lifestyle risk reduction engagement during the interconception period. METHODS: The JBI methodology guided our scoping review. Six databases were searched for peer-reviewed, English-language research papers published between 2010 and 2021 on topics including perceptions, attitudes, lifestyle, postpartum, preconception and interconception. Title-abstract and full text screening was independently undertaken by two authors. Included papers' reference lists were searched to find additional papers. The main concepts were then identified using a descriptive and tabular approach. RESULTS: A total of 1734 papers were screened and 33 met our inclusion criteria. Most included papers (82%, n=27) reported on nutrition and/or physical activity. Papers identified interconception through postpartum and/or preconception. Women's self-management needs for lifestyle risk reduction engagement during interconception included: informational needs, managing competing priorities, physical and mental health, self-perception and motivation, access to services and professional support, and family and peer networks. CONCLUSIONS: There is a range of challenges for women to engage in lifestyle risk reduction during interconception. To enable women's preferences for how lifestyle risk reduction activities can be enacted, issues including childcare, ongoing and tailored health professional support, domestic support, cost and health literacy need to be addressed.",0
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Dental Preferences of Patients at Private University Hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","Studies that particularly look into how the pandemic has affected Saudi Arabian patients' dental preferences are scarce. The majority of the research done so far has focused on the pandemic's broad effects on oral health rather than the specific changes in patient preferences for dental care. Therefore, the primary goal of the study was to examine how patients at a private university dental hospital underwent dental procedures both before and after the pandemic. The study is a retrospective analysis of patient data from March 2019 to February 2022 obtained from electronic hospital records (Dentoplus). The data extracted information pertaining to the number of patients and their periodic visits. The data was examined via statistical tests. At 0.05, the significance level was chosen. According to the research, compared to non-lockdown times, lockdown times saw a considerable drop in the number of patients scheduling appointments. There was also a significant decrease in the number of first-time patients during lockdown periods. The study also revealed a significant increase in the number of cancelled appointments and patients who discontinued treatment during lockdown periods. The age and gender of the patients did not have a significant effect on these findings. The study's findings suggest that dental professionals need to be aware of these changes in patient behavior and adapt their services accordingly. Dental clinics may need to focus on promoting their services and ensuring that patients feel safe and comfortable seeking dental care during the pandemic.",0
"Trial of labor after cesarean, vaginal birth after cesarean, and the risk of uterine rupture: an expert review.","The decision to pursue a trial of labor after cesarean delivery is complex and depends on patient preference, the likelihood of successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery, assessment of the risks vs benefits of trial of labor after cesarean delivery, and available resources to support safe trial of labor after cesarean delivery at the planned birthing center. The most feared complication of trial of labor after cesarean delivery is uterine rupture, which can have catastrophic consequences, including substantial maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Although the absolute risk of uterine rupture is low, several clinical, historical, obstetrical, and intrapartum factors have been associated with increased risk. It is therefore critical for clinicians managing patients during trial of labor after cesarean delivery to be aware of these risk factors to appropriately select candidates for trial of labor after cesarean delivery and maximize the safety and benefits while minimizing the risks. Caution is advised when considering labor augmentation and induction in patients with a previous cesarean delivery. With established hospital safety protocols that dictate close maternal and fetal monitoring, avoidance of prostaglandins, and careful titration of oxytocin infusion when induction agents are needed, spontaneous and induced trial of labor after cesarean delivery are safe and should be offered to most patients with 1 previous low transverse, low vertical, or unknown uterine incision after appropriate evaluation, counseling, planning, and shared decision-making. Future research should focus on clarifying true risk factors and identifying the optimal approach to intrapartum and induction management, tools for antenatal prediction, and strategies for prevention of uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean delivery. A better understanding will facilitate patient counseling, support efforts to improve trial of labor after cesarean delivery and vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates, and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean delivery.",0
Treatment Preferences of Adolescents and Young Adults with Depressive Symptoms: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Depression in adolescents and young adults is common and causes considerable disease burden while hampering their development, leading to adverse consequences in later life. Although treatment is available, young people are a vulnerable group regarding uptake and completion of treatment. To improve this, insight into youth's preferences for treatment is essential. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate patient preferences for depression treatment in a Dutch sample aged 16-24 years using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). METHODS: The study was conducted in The Netherlands between October 2018 and June 2019, and included 236 adolescents and young adults with current depressive symptoms or previous treatment. The DCE included five attributes (treatment type, frequency of appointment, waiting time, effectiveness, evaluation of therapeutic alliance) with corresponding levels. Results were analysed using latent class analysis. RESULTS: Results show a general preference for individual psychotherapy, treatment with high frequency, high effectiveness, short waiting time and a standard evaluation of the therapeutic alliance ('click' with the therapist) early in treatment. Latent class analysis revealed three different patterns of preferences regarding treatment type and willingness to engage in therapy. The first class showed a strong preference for individual therapy. The second class, including relatively older, higher educated and treatment-experienced participants, preferred high frequency treatment and was more open to different forms of therapy. The third class, including lower educated, younger and treatment-naïve adolescents showed reluctance to engage in therapy overall and in group therapy specifically. CONCLUSION: In this DCE, three classes could be identified that share similar preferences regarding treatment effectiveness, waiting time and evaluation of the therapeutic alliance, but varied considerably in their preference for treatment type (individual, group, or combined psychotherapy) and their willingness to engage. The results from this study may inform mental health care providers and institutions and help optimize professional care for adolescents and young adults with depressive symptoms, improving engagement in this vulnerable group.",1
Alternatives to Opioids for Managing Pain.,"The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) revised the definition of pain in 2020 as ""An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage.""  Ongoing or recurring pain for three or more months has been defined as chronic pain by the same organization.  In comparison, acute pain can have an abrupt onset and is usually short-lasting. Chronic pain problems usually manifest initially as acute pain, and many chronic pain conditions are associated with an intermittent acute flare-up of pain. Chronic pain is a widespread health problem, with approximately 100 million people in the United States suffering from chronic pain in 2008. About 13 to 50% of adults in the United Kingdom have been estimated to suffer from chronic pain. This leads to a significant economic toll through direct healthcare costs associated with treatment and lost productivity. The estimated economic burden ranged from $560 to $635 billion in 2010, which is much higher than that of diabetes, cardiac problems, or cancer. The goal of treatment for chronic pain is the reduction of pain intensity and the improvement of function and quality of life. Apart from efficacy, the adverse effects, side-effect profile, economic factors, and patient preference should also be considered during the selection of a treatment modality. Multimodal management has been recommended for chronic pain, including medications, exercises, lifestyle modification, physical therapy, pain psychology, behavioral modalities, interventional pain modalities, and alternative medicine.",0
A response to Al et al. Trials 2023;24:233.,"In their recent paper, Al and colleagues (Trials 2023;24:233) argue that manipulation of the methods of recruitment using well-known techniques in order to increase enrollment can be ethically acceptable. This brief response challenges that notion as an affront to voluntariness and a devolution of the ethics of human subjects research to the ""ethics"" of the marketplace.",0
Trans-pacific multicenter collaborative study of minimally invasive proximal versus total gastrectomy for proximal gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancers.,"BACKGROUND: The current standard operation for proximal gastric and gastroesophageal junction (P/GEJ) cancers with limited esophageal extension is total gastrectomy (TG). TG is associated with impaired appetite and weight loss due to the loss of gastric functions such as production of ghrelin and with anemia due to intrinsic factor loss and vitamin B(12) malabsorption. Theoretically, proximal gastrectomy (PG) can mitigate these problems by preserving gastric function. However, PG with direct esophagogastric reconstruction is associated with severe postoperative reflux, delayed gastric emptying, and poor quality of life (QoL). Minimally invasive PG (MIPG) with antireflux techniques has been increasingly performed by experts but is technically demanding owing to its complexity. Moreover, the actual advantages of MIPG over minimally invasive TG (MITG) with regards to postoperative QoL are unknown. Our overall objective of this study is to determine the short-term QoL benefits of MIPG. Our central hypotheses are that MIPG is safe and that patients have improved appetite after MIPG with effective antireflux techniques, which leads to an overall QoL improvement when compared with MITG. METHODS: Enrollment of a total of 60 patients in this prospective survey-collection study is expected. Procedures (MITG versus MIPG, antireflux techniques for MIPG [double-tract reconstruction versus the double-flap technique]) will be chosen based on surgeon and/or patient preference. Randomization is not considered feasible because patients often have strong preferences regarding MITG and MIPG. The primary outcome is appetite level (reported on a 0-10 scale) at 3 months after surgery. With an expected 30 patients per cohort (MITG versus MIPG), this study will have 80% power to detect a one-point difference in appetite level. Patient-reported outcomes will be longitudinally collected (including questions about appetite and reflux), and specific QoL items, body weight, body mass index and ghrelin, albumin, and hemoglobin levels will be compared. DISCUSSION: Surgeons from the US, Japan, and South Korea formed this collaboration with the agreement that the surgical approach to P/GEJ cancers is an internationally important but controversial topic that requires immediate action. At the completion of the proposed research, our expected outcome is the establishment of the benefit and safety of MIPG. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with Clinical Trials Reporting Program Registration under the registration number NCI-2022-00267 on January 11, 2022, as well as with ClinicalTrials.gov under the registration number NCT05205343 on January 11, 2022.",0
Beyond MACE: a multidimensional approach to outcomes in clinical trials for older adults with stable ischemic heart disease.,"The global population of older adults is expanding rapidly resulting in a shift towards managing multiple chronic diseases that coexist and may be exacerbated by cardiovascular illness. Stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) is a predominant contributor to morbidity and mortality in the older adult population. Although results from clinical trials demonstrate that chronological age is a predictor of poor health outcomes, the current management approach remains suboptimal due to insufficient representation of older adults in randomized trials and the inadequate consideration for the interaction between biological aging, concurrent geriatric syndromes, and patient preferences. A shift towards a more patient-centered approach is necessary for appropriately and effectively managing SIHD in the older adult population. In this review, we aim to demonstrate the distinctive needs of older adults who prioritize holistic health outcomes like functional capacity, cognitive abilities, mental health, and quality of life alongside the prevention of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes reported in cardiovascular clinical trials. An individualized, patient-centered approach that involves shared decision-making regarding outcome prioritization is needed when any treatment strategy is being considered. By prioritizing patients and addressing their unique needs for successful aging, we can provide more effective care to a patient population that exhibits the highest cardiovascular risks.",0
Evolving therapeutic landscape of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: challenges and aspirations.,"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the commonest subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and encompasses a group of diverse disease entities, each harboring unique molecular and clinico-pathological features. The understanding of the molecular landscape of DLBCL has improved significantly over the past decade, highlighting unique genomic subtypes with implications on targeted therapy. At the same time, several new treatment modalities have been recently approved both in the frontline and relapsed settings, ending a dearth of negative clinical trials that plagued the past decade. Despite that, in the real-world setting, issues like drug accessibility, reimbursement policies, physician and patient preference, as well as questions regarding optimal sequencing of treatment options present difficulties and challenges in day-to-day oncology practice. Here, we review the recent advances in the therapeutic armamentarium of DLBCL and discuss implications on the practice landscape, with a particular emphasis on the context of the healthcare system in Singapore.",0
Survival and long-term quality-of-life of concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus surgery followed by radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy for the treatment of resectable stage III/IV hypopharyngeal carcinoma.,"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the utility of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) compared to surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (with or without concurrent chemotherapy) (SRT) in terms of improving the life expectancy and quality-of-life (QOL) of patients with stage III/IV hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (HPSCCs). METHODS: From January 2010 to July 2018, a total of 299 patients with stage III/IV HPSCC who received surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (with or without concurrent chemotherapy) (SRT, n = 111), or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT, n = 188) in our hospital were included. We measured overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). We used the EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-H&N35, and Voice handicap index-30 (VHI-30) instruments to assess the long-term QOL. RESULTS: The OS and DFS afforded by SRT were significantly better than those associated with CCRT (p = 0.039; p = 0.048 respectively), especially for stage N2-N3 patients. CCRT patients experienced better speech outcomes. CONCLUSION: For resectable stage III/IV HPSCC patients, appropriate treatment plans should be selected comprehensively considering survival rate, QOL, patient preference and multidisciplinary treatment.",0
How Do We Manage Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in India.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia was an ignored leukemia in India until a decade back, given its low prevalence and absence of novel drugs to treat it. Healthcare in India is heterogeneous, with variations in population, health systems, and reimbursement options. We have focused on opinions from three hemato-oncologists incorporating an opinion poll from 44 hemato-oncologists across India on the common issues in CLL to give an idea of the practice pan-India. RECENT FINDINGS: More CLL patients are being diagnosed in their early stages. There is an attempt to use prognostic and predictive markers in making shared decisions for managing CLL. There is still a role for chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) in India, given limited health insurance coverage. But with the availability of inexpensive generics, the patient preference for non-CIT options like Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors is palpable. The CLL scene in India is changing rapidly. With the wide availability of economical generic small molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and coverage by social health insurance schemes, India is poised to cater to most CLL patient needs.",0
Angiosarcoma of the breast: A review.,"Breast angiosarcoma is a rare and highly aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. It can occur spontaneously or be associated with factors such as radiation therapy or chronic lymphedema. The etiology and pathogenesis of this disease are still unclear, the clinical symptoms and imaging findings lack specificity, and the pathological morphology is diverse, which is easy to be confused with other diseases. There is no clear guideline for surgical treatment. Although the optimal surgical approach remains unclear, the ultimate goal is surgical excision with optimal margins, which remains the primary method of treatment. In clinical practice, the choice of the surgical approach should be made by considering the tumor size, pathological type, and patient preferences. In clinical practice, the selection of surgical methods should be carried out with comprehensive consideration of tumor size, pathological types and patients' wishes. There is no clear consensus on whether radiotherapy and chemotherapy should be carried out after surgery, and its optimal program and efficacy are uncertain. This article reviews the etiology, clinical manifestations, pathological features, imaging findings, treatment, prognosis and other aspects of breast angiosarcoma, so as to strengthen clinicians' overall understanding of this disease and avoid missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis.",0
Rate and reasons for peritoneal dialysis dropout following haemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis switch: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Patient experiences and survival outcomes can be influenced by the circumstances related to dialysis initiation and subsequent modality choices. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the rate and reasons for peritoneal dialysis (PD) dropout following haemodialysis (HD) to PD switch. METHOD: This systematic review conducted searches in four databases, including Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (study ID: CRD42023405718). Outcomes included factors leading to the switch from HD to PD, the rate and reasons for PD dropout and mortality difference in two groups (PD first group versus HD to PD group). The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist and the GRADE tool were used to assess quality. RESULTS: 4971 papers were detected, and 13 studies were included. On meta-analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in PD dropout in the PD first group (OR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.61, 1.09; I(2) = 83%; P = 0.16), however, there was a statistically significant reduction in the rate of mortality (OR: 0.48; 95%CI: 0.25, 0.92; I2 = 73%; P = 0.03) compared to the HD to PD group. The primary reasons for HD to PD switch, included vascular access failure, patient preference, social issues, and cardiovascular disease. Causes for PD dropout differed between the two groups, but inadequate dialysis and peritonitis were the main reasons for PD dropout in both groups. CONCLUSION: Compared to the PD first group, a previous HD history may not impact PD dropout rates for patients, but it could impact mortality in the HD to PD group. The reasons for PD dropout differed between the two groups, with no statistical differences. Psychosocial reasons for PD dropout are valuable to further research. Additionally, establishing a consensus on the definition of PD dropout is crucial for future studies.",0
Real-World Evidence Comparing Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab in Antitumor Necrosis Factor-Experienced Patients With Crohn's Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Many patients with Crohn's disease (CD) lose response or become intolerant to antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy and subsequently switch out of class. We compared the effectiveness and safety of ustekinumab to vedolizumab in a large, geographically diverse US population of TNF-experienced patients with CD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using longitudinal claims data from a large US insurer (Anthem, Inc.). We identified patients with CD initiating vedolizumab or ustekinumab with anti-TNF treatment in the prior 6 months. Our primary outcome was treatment persistence for >52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included (i) all-cause hospitalization, (ii) hospitalization for CD with surgery, (iii) hospitalization for CD without surgery, and (iv) hospitalization for infection. Propensity score fine stratification was used to control for demographic and baseline clinical characteristics and prior treatments. RESULTS: Among 885 new users of ustekinumab and 490 new users of vedolizumab, we observed no difference in treatment persistence (adjusted risk ratio 1.09 [95% confidence interval 0.95-1.25]). Ustekinumab was associated with a lower rate of all-cause hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 0.73 [0.59-0.91]), nonsurgical CD hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio 0.58 [0.40-0.83]), and hospitalization for infection (adjusted hazard ratio 0.56 [0.34-0.92]). DISCUSSION: This real-world comparative effectiveness study of anti-TNF-experienced patients with CD initiating vedolizumab or ustekinumab showed similar treatment persistence rates beyond 52 weeks, although secondary outcomes such as all-cause hospitalizations, nonsurgical CD hospitalizations, and hospitalizations for infection favored ustekinumab initiation. We, therefore, advocate for individualized decision making in this medically refractory population, considering patient preference and other factors such as cost and route of administration.",0
Patient and clinician perspectives of a remote monitoring program for COVID-19 and lessons for future programs.,"COVID Watch is a remote patient monitoring program implemented during the pandemic to support home dwelling patients with COVID-19. The program conferred a large survival advantage. We conducted semi-structured interviews of 85 patients and clinicians using COVID Watch to understand how to design such programs even better. Patients and clinicians found COVID Watch to be comforting and beneficial, but both groups desired more clarity about the purpose and timing of enrollment and alternatives to text-messages to adapt to patients' preferences as these may have limited engagement and enrollment among marginalized patient populations. Because inclusiveness and equity are important elements of programmatic success, future programs will need flexible and multi-channel human-to-human communication pathways for complex clinical interactions or for patients who do not desire tech-first approaches.",0
Development of attributes and attribute levels for a discrete choice experiment on patients' and providers' choice for antiretroviral therapy service in Northwest Ethiopia.,"BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are used to assess the strength of preferences and value of interventions. However, researchers using this approach have been criticized for not conducting or publishing rigorous studies to select the required attributes and levels. Proper specification of attributes and their levels determines the validity of DCE. Hence, our study aimed to identify and define attributes and levels for the design of a DCE to elicit patients' and providers' preferences for ART service in Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: Four stages were followed to derive the final list of attributes and levels: (1) a literature review to derive conceptual attributes; (2) key informant interviews of 17 providers and in-depth interviews of 15 adult stable patients to identify context-specific attributes and attribute levels; (3) ranking survey among 31 HIV/AIDS program implementers and rating survey among 35 adult stable patients and 42 health workers providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) service to indicate participants' preference of attributes; and (4) an expert opinion to reduce the list of attributes and levels. RESULTS: First, a literature review identified 23 candidate attributes. Second, individual-level analysis of the qualitative transcripts confirmed 15 of these 23 attributes. Third, the ranking and rating surveys put the importance of the 23 ART service attributes in order of preference. Fourth, through discussions with eight experts, 17 attributes were discarded based on multiple criteria. The six retained attributes were: the location of ART refills, the frequency of receiving ART refills, the person providing ART refills, the participants/others seen at the same ART refill visit, medication refill pick-up/delivery times, and the total cost of the visit during antiretroviral (ARV) medication refill. Finally, levels were assigned to these 6 attributes based on data from the literature, transcripts, and knowledge of the Ethiopian context. CONCLUSIONS: This detailed description illuminates the attribute development process and provides the reader with a basis for evaluating the rigor of this phase of DCE construction. This paper contributes empirical evidence to the limited methodological literature on attributes and levels of development for DCE, thereby providing further empirical guidance on ART service preference, specifically among patients of low- and middle-income countries.",1
Cancer patients' experiences and preferences when receiving bad news: a qualitative study.,"PURPOSE: Receiving a cancer diagnosis significantly impacts patients' lives, and how the bad news is delivered influences patients' trajectory, psychosocial adjustment and openness to psycho-oncological support. We explored how patients' experiences, reactions and preferences were when receiving the news and which optimization recommendations can be made. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory qualitative study with patients who enrolled in the new integrated cross-sectoral psycho-oncological care programme 'isPO', being enrolled 12 months post-diagnosis. Data on the main issue (i.e. perception of the moment when the diagnosis is received) were collected via telephone interviews that were fully audiotaped and transcribed. Two independent coders conducted inductive content analyses using MAXQDA. RESULTS: Out of 38 approached patients, 23 cancer patients with 13 different tumour entities participated. They had a mean age of 54.2 (SD 16.2); n = 17 (74%) were female. Three major themes with 14 corresponding subthemes emerged: (1) patients' experiences with the bad news delivery, including setting, mode, preparation and perceived needs; (2) patients' reactions to the bad news, such as shock, fear and helplessness, disbelief and denial, anger and feeling of injustice, thankfulness and depression; and (3) patients' receiving preferences, including psycho-oncological support, addressing informational needs, needs-driven comprehensive support and a competent multidisciplinary support team. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of bad news delivery and addressing patients' needs should be strongly considered by physicians. We recommend integrating patients' perspective on the quality management processes of breaking bad news. For providing needs-centred high-quality care, applying existing guidelines and acquiring patient-centred communication skills are central.",0
Colorectal Cancer Screening and Surveillance in the Geriatric Population.,"PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: Our national guidelines regarding screening and surveillance for colorectal cancer recommend individualized discussions with patients 75-85 years of age. This review explores the complex decision-making that surrounds these discussions. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite updated guidelines for colorectal cancer screening and surveillance, the guidance for patients 75 years of age or older remains unchanged. Studies exploring the risks to colonoscopy in this population, patient preferences, life expectancy calculators and additional studies in the subpopulation of inflammatory bowel disease patients provide points of consideration to aid in individualized discussions. The benefit-risk discussion for colorectal cancer screening in patients over 75 years old warrants further guidance to develop best practice. To craft more comprehensive recommendations, additional research with inclusion of such patients is needed.",0
"Objectivity, practicality, and significance of practice guidelines for the practicing neurologists: What we learnt from consensus criteria in CIDP, Myasthenia Gravis and Inflammatory Myopathies.","The value of practice guidelines in the three most common autoimmune neuromuscular disorders, namely Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP), Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and Autoimmune Inflammatory Myopathies (AIM), has been extensively debated regarding their usefulness in clinical practice, objectivity and universal value considering that guidelines are also established regionally in certain countries. This commentary highlights common concerns on how guidelines are presently generated, pointing out: (a) non-sufficient diversity among Task-Force members to identify and address not only routine clinical and electrophysiology issues but also immunology, imaging, pathology, biomarkers, epidemiology or treatment economics; (b) Task-Force being often comprised by the same or seemingly like-minded members conveying the erroneous impression that experts with opposing views might have been excluded, even if this is clearly not the case; and (c) relying on web-based registries or retrospective data collections from heterogeneous sources. As a result, the existing practice guidelines in CIDP, MG and AIM remain an unfinished business but an excellent base for further enhancement. Guidelines can be extremely helpful not only for clinical trials but also in clinical practice if viewed as a living document with continuously updated versions by experts even with opposing views with precise information on diagnostics, pathomechanisms, therapeutic schemes, evolving biomarkers and economics of new therapies with validation of the post-guidelines criteria. Geographic diversity should be taken into consideration because the availability of biomarker testing, and therapies differ among countries. Patient preferences need to be also considered in therapeutic guidelines because newly marketed drugs offer more options steadily changing the therapeutic algorithms in autoimmune neuromuscular diseases generating also questions as to whether they also influence decisions on insurance coverage. Collectively, these startup considerations are aimed to make practice guidelines more objective, widely acceptable worldwide and more practical or easier to follow in clinical practice.",0
Treatment patterns and healthcare costs among patients with psoriasis initiating apremilast or biologics: a retrospective claims database cohort analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare treatment patterns and healthcare costs for patients with psoriasis who initiate apremilast, tumor necrosis factor inhibitor, or interleukin inhibitor. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used Optum Clinformatics(®) Data Mart to identify propensity score-matched patients initiating apremilast, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, or interleukin inhibitors, with 12-month baseline and 24-month follow-up data. Switch, discontinuation, persistence, healthcare resource utilization, and total healthcare costs were assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-four-month switch rates were highest for tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (32%), followed by apremilast (21%) then interleukin inhibitors (14%). Mean (SD) per-patient-per-month costs for switchers were lowest for apremilast ($4213 [$2304]), higher for tumor necrosis factor inhibitors ($5274 [$2280]), and highest for interleukin inhibitors ($5539 [$2296]; p < .001), primarily attributable to pharmacy costs: $3466 (apremilast), $4432 (tumor necrosis factor inhibitor), and $4721 (interleukin inhibitor). LIMITATIONS: Psoriasis severity is absent from claims data; cost outcomes may be influenced by more severe psoriasis being more costly. CONCLUSION: Switching psoriasis treatment is common and increases over time. Apremilast initiators had lower switch rates and costs compared with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, despite lower effectiveness reported in previous studies, perhaps indicating patient preference for oral treatment. Additional oral options may be desirable for this population.",0
"Can the General Public Be a Proxy for an ""At-Risk"" Group in a Patient Preference Study? A Disease Prevention Example in Rheumatoid Arthritis.","BACKGROUND: When selecting samples for patient preference studies, it may be difficult or impractical to recruit participants who are eligible for a particular treatment decision. However, a general public sample may not be an appropriate proxy. OBJECTIVE: This study compares preferences for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) preventive treatments between members of the general public and first-degree relatives (FDRs) of confirmed RA patients to assess whether a sample of the general public can be used as a proxy for FDRs. METHODS: Participants were asked to imagine they were experiencing arthralgia and had screening tests indicating a 60% chance of developing RA within 2 yrs. Using a discrete choice experiment, participants were offered a series of choices between no treatment and 2 unlabeled hypothetical treatments to reduce the risk of RA. To assess data quality, time to complete survey sections and comprehension questions were assessed. A random parameter logit model was used to obtain attribute-level estimates, which were used to calculate relative importance, maximum acceptable risk (MAR), and market shares of hypothetical preventive treatments. RESULTS: The FDR sample (n = 298) spent more time completing the survey and performed better on comprehension questions compared with the general public sample (n = 982). The relative importance ranking was similar between the general public and FDR participant samples; however, other relative preference measures involving weights including MARs and market share differed between groups, with FDRs having numerically higher MARs. CONCLUSION: In the context of RA prevention, the general public (average risk) may be a reasonable proxy for a more at-risk sample (FDRs) for overall relative importance ranking but not weights. The rationale for a proxy sample should be clearly justified. HIGHLIGHTS: Participants from the general public were compared to first-degree relatives on their preferences for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) preventive treatments using a discrete choice experiment.Preferences were similar between groups in terms of the most important and least important attributes of preventive treatments, with effectiveness being the most important attribute. However, relative weights differed.Attention to the survey and predicted market shares of hypothetical RA preventive treatments differed between the general public and first-degree relatives.The general public may be a reasonable proxy for an at-risk group for patient preferences ranks but not weights in the disease prevention context; however, care should be taken in sample selection for patient preference studies when choosing nonpatients.",1
Racial Disparity in Tympanostomy Tube Placement in Inpatient Pediatric Admissions.,"This study aims to evaluate if race and ethnicity affect rates of tympanostomy tube (TT) placement during inpatient pediatric admissions in children with otologic conditions. A review of the 2016 Kids' Inpatient Database was conducted based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes for common otologic conditions. Among 85 827 weighted pediatric inpatient discharges with ICD-10-CM codes for common otologic conditions, 213 underwent TT placement. Odds ratios (ORs) for children of Hispanic ethnicity and Asian or Pacific Islander race undergoing TT placement when compared to other ethnicities and races were 0.60 (P = .011) and 0.21 (P = .040), respectively. Multiple logistic regression showed Hispanic ethnicity was associated with lower rates of TT placement when compared to non-Hispanic white children (OR = 0.62; 95% confidence interval = 0.40-0.96). Future studies should assess why these differences exist and if these differences are associated with racial/ethnic bias or attributed to patient/family preference.",0
How should respiratory depression and loss of airway patency be handled during initiation of palliative sedation?,BACKGROUND: Loss of airway patency has been reported during initiation of palliative sedation. In present guidelines the loss of airway patency during initiation of palliative sedation is not addressed. Airway patency can be restored by jaw thrust/chin lift or placing the patient in the recovery position. AIM: A structured ethical analysis of how respiratory depression and loss of airway patency during initiation of palliative sedation should be handled. The essence of the dilemma is whether it is appropriate to apply simple non-invasive methods to restore airway patency in order to avoid the patient's immediate death. DESIGN: A structured analysis based on the four principles of healthcare ethics and stakeholders' interests. RESULTS: Beneficence and autonomy support a decision not to regain airway patency whereas non-maleficence lends weight to a decision to restore airway patency. Whether the proportionality criterion of the principle of double effect is met depends on the features of the individual case. The ethical problem appears to be a genuine dilemma where important values and arguments point to different conclusions. CONCLUSION: Whether to restore airway patency when the airway is obstructed during initiation of palliative sedation will ultimately be based on clinical judgment taking into account both any known patient preferences and relevant clinical information. There are strong arguments favoring both options in this clinical and ethical dilemma. The fact that a clear and universal recommendation cannot be made does not imply indifference regarding what is the clinically and ethically best option for each individual patient.,0
Physical Activity Preferences of People Living with Brain Injury: Formative Qualitative Research to Develop a Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The World Health Organization physical activity guidelines for people living with disability do not consider the needs of people living with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury. This paper describes the qualitative co-development of a discrete choice experiment survey to inform the adaption of these guidelines by identifying the physical activity preferences of people living with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury in Australia. METHODS: The research team comprised researchers, people with lived experience of traumatic brain injury and health professionals with expertise in traumatic brain injury. We followed a four-stage process: (1) identification of key constructs and initial expression of attributes, (2) critique and refinement of attributes, (3) prioritisation of attributes and refinement of levels and (4) testing and refining language, format and comprehensibility. Data collection included deliberative dialogue, focus groups and think-aloud interviews with 22 purposively sampled people living with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury. Strategies were used to support inclusive participation. Analysis employed qualitative description and framework methods. RESULTS: This formative process resulted in discarding, merging, renaming and reconceptualising attributes and levels. Attributes were reduced from an initial list of 17 to six: (1) Type of activity, (2) Out-of-pocket cost, (3) Travel time, (4) Who with, (5) Facilitated by and (6) Accessibility of setting. Confusing terminology and cumbersome features of the survey instrument were also revised. Challenges included purposive recruitment, reducing diverse stakeholder views to a few attributes, finding the right language and navigating the complexity of discrete choice experiment scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: This formative co-development process significantly improved the relevance and comprehensibility of the discrete choice experiment survey tool. This process may be applicable in other discrete choice experiment studies.",1
Balancing benefits and risks in lung cancer therapies: patient preferences for lung cancer treatment alternatives.,"BACKGROUND: In the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) the combination of Immuno- Oncotherapy (IO) and chemotherapy (CT) has been found to be superior to IO or CT alone for patients' survival. Patients and clinicians are confronted with a preference sensitive choice between a more aggressive treatment with a greater negative effect on quality of life versus alternatives that are less effective but have fewer side effects. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to: (a) quantify patients' preferences for relevant attributes related to Immuno-Oncotherapy treatment alternatives, and (b) evaluate the maximum acceptable risk (MAR)/Minimum acceptable benefit (MAB) that patients would accept for treatment alternatives. METHODS: An online preference survey using discrete-choice experiment (DCE) was completed by NSCLC patients from two hospitals in Italy and Belgium. The survey asked patients' preferences for five patient- relevant treatment attributes. The DCE was developed using a Bayesian D-efficient design. DCE analyses were performed using mixed logit models. Information regarding patient demographics, health literacy, locus of control, and quality of life was also collected. RESULTS: 307 patients (158 Italian, 149 Belgian), stage I to IV, completed the survey. Patients preferred treatments with a higher 5-year survival chance as the most important attribute over all the other attributes. Preference heterogeneity for the attribute weights depended on health literacy, patients' age and locus of control. Patients were willing to accept a substantially increased risks of developing side effects in exchange for the slightest increase (1%) in the chance of surviving at least 5 years from the diagnosis of cancer. Similarly, patients were willing to accept a switch in the mode of administration or complete loss of hair to obtain an increase in survival. CONCLUSION: In this study, the proportion of respondents who systematically preferred survival over all other treatment attributes was particularly high. Age, objective health literacy and locus of control accounted for heterogeneity in patients' preferences. Evidence on how NSCLC patients trade between survival and other NSCLC attributes can support regulators and other stakeholders on assessing clinical trial evidence and protocols, based on patients' conditions and socio-demographic parameters.",1
Citizen attitudes to non-treatment decision making: a Norwegian survey.,"BACKGROUND: Decisions about appropriate treatment at the end of life are common in modern healthcare. Non-treatment decisions (NTDs), comprising both withdrawal and withholding of (potentially) life-prolonging treatment are in principle accepted in Norway. However, in practice they may give rise to significant moral problems for health professionals, patients and next of kin. Here, patient values must be considered. It is relevant to study the moral views and intuitions of the general population on NTDs and special areas of contention such as the role of next of kin in decision-making. METHODS: Electronic survey to members of a nationally representative panel of Norwegian adults. Respondents were presented with vignettes describing patients with disorders of consciousness, dementia, and cancer where patient preferences varied. Respondents answered ten questions about the acceptability of non-treatment decision making and the role of next of kin. RESULTS: We received 1035 complete responses (response rate 40.7%). A large majority, 88%, supported the right of competent patients to refuse treatment in general. When an NTD was in line with the patient's previously expressed preferences, more respondents tended to find NTDs acceptable. More respondents would accept NTDs for themselves than for the vignette patients. In a scenario with an incompetent patient, clear majorities wanted the views of next of kin to be given some but not decisive weight, and more weight if concordant with the patient's wishes. There were, however, large variations in the respondents' views. CONCLUSION: This survey of a representative sample of the Norwegian adult population indicates that attitudes to NTDs are often in line with national laws and guidelines. However, the high variance among the respondents and relatively large weight given to next of kin's views, indicate a need for appropriate dialogue among all stakeholders to prevent conflicts and extra burdens. Furthermore, the emphasis given to previously expressed opinions indicates that advance care planning may increase the legitimacy of NTDs and prevent challenging decision-making processes.",0
Investigation of predictors influencing patient-pharmacist relationship establishment.,"BACKGROUND: A strong patient-pharmacist relationship is tied to patients' trust and confidence in pharmacists and pharmacy services. While past research has described patient-pharmacist relationship archetypes (i.e., ""customer,"" ""client,"" ""partner"") with potential to help pharmacists initially understand patients' preferences and expectations of care and services, little is known about potential factors that underlie these preferences and expectations. OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to [1] compare the prevalence of the current and desired patient-pharmacist relationships archetypes reported by patients and [2] identify the sociodemographic, health, and medication use and procurement factors predictive of the archetypes representing patients' current relationship with outpatient pharmacists. METHODS: Data from 1521 patients were collected via the 2021 National Consumer Survey on Medication Experience and Pharmacists' Role. Patient-pharmacist relationship distribution across patients' sociodemographic characteristics was explored using crosstabulations. Multinomial logistic regression was also used to investigate the association between patient sociodemographic characteristics and the current patient-pharmacist archetype relationships. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 53.9 years and 57.3% were married. Thirty-two percent of the patients reported currently having a ""Customer"" relationship, while 17.9% and 15.2% reported having a ""Client"" and ""Partner"" archetype relationship, respectively. ""Client"" (25.2%) and ""Partner"" (20.2%) relationships were the most commonly preferred archetypal relationships. The odds ratios (OR) of having ""Client"" or ""Partner"" relationships increased with the number of patients' health conditions and medications. Patients who visited independently owned and clinic pharmacies had a higher OR of building professional relationships with a pharmacist. CONCLUSION: The qualities of a patient-pharmacist relationship may be associated with key patient characteristics. Pharmacists can build relationships with patients informed by a continuum of patient preferences, expectations, and needs to optimize health outcomes.",0
A qualitative study on people with opioid use disorders' perspectives on smoking and smoking cessation interventions.,"INTRODUCTION: Smoking-related diseases are major contributors to disability and shorter life expectancy among opioid-dependent patients. Smoking prevalence is considerably higher for opioid-dependent persons than among the general population, and only a minority quit smoking in treatment settings. Studies show that pharmacological smoking cessation interventions have modest success rates. This study aimed to investigate patients' receiving opioid agonist therapy perspectives on factors affecting behavior and decisions related to smoking cessation, and their experiences with smoking cessation. METHODS: This is a qualitative study using semi-structured individual interviews. The participants were asked, among others, to elaborate on the participants' thoughts about smoking, previous attempts to quit tobacco use, and what could prompt a smoking cessation attempt. We analyzed the transcripts with systematic text condensation. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research and the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines were followed. Opioid-dependent patients receiving opioid agonist therapy in outpatient clinics were invited to participate using a purposive sampling method. In total, fourteen individuals participated in this study. RESULTS: We identified six themes which were: (1) reflections on how smoking affected decisions, (2) smoking and its impact on physical and mental health, (3) the economy as a motivator to stop smoking, (4) emotions, desires, and habits related to smoking, (5) knowledge of smoking, smoking cessation, and quit attempts, and (6) social factors influencing the participants' choices and activities. The participants were well informed about the consequences of smoking and had some knowledge and experience in quitting. The participants' pulmonary health was an important motivational factor for change. Withdrawal symptoms, anxiety, and fear of using other substances discouraged several from attempting to quit smoking. In contrast, social support from partners and access to meaningful activities were considered important factors for success. Few reported being offered help from health professionals to make a smoking cessation attempt. DISCUSSION: Experiencing social support, being encouraged to quit smoking, and patients' concerns for their physical health were important reasons for wanting to quit smoking. Smoking cessation interventions based on patient preferences and on the behavior change wheel may enable a higher success rate among patients receiving opioid agonist therapy.",0
Physicians approach shared decision-making for sports eligibility decisions heterogeneously.,"BACKGROUND: There is limited data regarding how clinicians operationalize shared decision-making (SDM) with athletes with cardiovascular diagnoses. This study was designed to explore sports cardiologists' conceptions of SDM and approaches to sports eligibility decisions. METHODS: 20 sports cardiologists were interviewed by telephone or video conference from October 2022 to May 2023. Qualitative descriptive analysis was conducted with the transcripts. RESULTS: All participants endorsed SDM for eligibility decisions, however, SDM was defined and operationalized heterogeneously. Only 6 participants specifically referenced eliciting patient preferences during SDM. Participants described variable roles for the physician in SDM and variable views on athletes' understanding, perception, and tolerance of risk. Participants thresholds for prohibitive annual risk of sudden cardiac death ranged from <1 % to >10 %. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reinforce the general acceptance of SDM for sports eligibility decisions and highlight the need to better understand this process and identify the most effective approach for operationalization.",0
Safety outcomes and patients' preferences for home-based intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in pompe disease and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) disorder: COVID-19 and beyond.,"BACKGROUND: The Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) demands precise information on benefit/risk profile of home-based enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of patients with Pompe disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). This passage is necessary to obtain the authorization for ERT home therapy, even after the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic period. This research intends to evaluate the safety, treatment satisfaction, and compliance of MPS I patients treated with laronidase (Aldurazyme®) and Pompe Disease patients treated with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme®) in a homecare setting. RESULTS: We report herein an early interim analysis of the HomERT (Home infusions of ERT) study, a multicenter, non-interventional, double-cohort study that retrospectively analyzed 38 patients from 14 sites in Italy: cohort A (Pompe disease - 32 patients) and cohort B (MPS I - 6 patients). Among the selected patients who started home therapy before enrollment, the average number of missed home-based infusions was 0.7 (1.3) in cohort A and 3.8 (6.4) in cohort B with no return to the hospital setting. Irrespective of the treatment location, 3 prior ADRs per cohort were reported. The majority of patients preferred home-based infusions (cohort A: 96.9%; cohort B: 100%): the main reason was attributed to treatment convenience (cohort A: 81.3%; cohort B: 83.3%). Despite the underlying conditions, most patients self-evaluated their health as ""good"" (cohort A: 50%; cohort B: 83.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of favorable safety profile, improved treatment compliance and personal satisfaction validates the use of ERT with laronidase and alglucosidase alfa as a strong candidate for home therapy.",0
The role of topical therapies along the psoriasis patient journey: An overview from the Symposium 'Tailoring topical psoriasis treatments to patients' needs and expectations' of the 30(th) EADV Congress 2021.,"This article summarizes a presentation titled 'The role of topical therapies along the psoriasis patient journey' held at the Satellite Symposium of the 30(th) European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress. During this session, the role of topical treatments in the management of psoriasis was presented, with a particular focus on the current unmet needs and data gaps. Psoriasis plays a significant role in a patient's daily life, impacting them not only physically but also psychologically and socially. The disease burden increases with duration and severity. Topical therapies are the keystone of the management of psoriasis. About 70%-80% of patients present a mild-to-moderate form of psoriasis that can be successfully treated with topical agents. According to a German recommendation, patients with mild psoriasis should initiate a topical therapy in combination with skin care products. In the real-life setting, the calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (CAL/BDP) fixed combination was the most prescribed topical treatment for beyond-mild patients in Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. Healthcare professionals also often or very often prescribed topicals as an alternative to non-biologic systemics in certain situations, such as patient preference (51%), contraindication (50%) and to limit side effects (26%). Adjunctive topical therapy to patients using systemic therapy is used to optimize treatment outcomes and improving the quality of life for patients. Topical treatments can be also effective in severe forms of psoriasis. However, there are still some gaps and unmet needs on topical therapy. Ineffectiveness, patient dissatisfaction and adherence are the largest barriers to treatment success. Main strengths of topical treatments include the availability of various topical ingredients and galenics, the adaptability to different anatomical areas and the possible combination with phototherapy and systemics. Moreover, patients in specific situations can benefit from switching to topical treatments (e.g. pregnancy or surgery).",0
Videoconferencing of Movement-Based and Psychologically Informed Interventions for Chronic Pain: A Systematic Review and Horizon Scan.,"Introduction: With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, use of telehealth technology increased dramatically. Nonpharmacological approaches to pain management may be well suited for virtual care. Yet, it is not widely understood if this treatment modality is effective when delivered via videoconferencing. This review examines the effectiveness of movement-based and psychologically informed chronic pain management interventions delivered via videoconferencing compared to in-person care. Methods: Searches of MEDLINE(®) (via Ovid(®)), Embase (via Elsevier), CINAHL Complete (via EBSCO), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (via Ovid) were performed from inception to June 10, 2021. All articles meeting eligibility criteria were included for data abstraction. Results: Eight thousand two hundred fifty-two citations were identified, and after removing duplicates, 4,661 citations remained. One study investigating acceptance and commitment therapy met eligibility criteria. The noninferiority randomized trial found no statistically significant difference in outcomes between delivery modalities. A horizon scan was conducted to assess planned or recent studies. Horizon scan results yielded six protocols in trial databases, one pilot study, and three published protocols for ongoing studies. Discussion: Findings from this study indicate that virtually delivered pain management is a possible substitute for in-person care. Given the paucity of evidence on this topic, further comparative and adequately powered studies that assess the impact of movement-based and psychologically informed pain management delivered via videoconferencing are needed. Conclusions: Research is needed to understand patient preferences of such interventions within a variety of settings. Such evaluations will be needed to guide clinical and operations practice to optimize equitable deployment and access to high-quality health care delivered via videoconferencing.",0
Collagenase Treatment Versus Needle Fasciotomy for Single-Digit Dupuytren Contractures: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"PURPOSE: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the available randomized controlled trial data comparing needle fasciotomy and collagenase treatment for single-digit Dupuytren contractures with a minimum of 3-year follow-up and determine whether one treatment is superior regarding contracture correction and functional outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching four databases for randomized controlled trials investigating the single-digit treatment outcomes for Dupuytren contracture comparing collagenase treatment and needle fasciotomy with a minimum of 3-year follow-up. The risk of bias of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model in anticipation of unobserved heterogeneity. The primary outcome measure was contracture recurrence. Secondary outcome measures included final fixed flexion contracture (FFC), Quick Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) scores, and Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main (URAM) scores. RESULTS: After screening 264 articles, 4 randomized clinical trials were eligible for final inclusion. One trial had a high risk of bias, and two trials had some concern for bias. The final meta-analysis included 347 patients, 169 who underwent collagenase treatment and 178 who underwent needle fasciotomy. No significant differences were noted between the groups in contracture recurrence, FFC, and URAM scores. The pooled data showed a higher QuickDASH score in the collagenase treatment group compared with the needle fasciotomy group, but the observed difference was less than what would be expected to be clinically relevant. CONCLUSIONS: Needle fasciotomy and collagenase treatment have similar outcomes with regards to contracture recurrence, final FFC, QuickDASH scores, and URAM scores for the single-digit treatment for Dupuytren contracture at a minimum of 3-year follow-up. Relevant factors that may be considered during the shared decision-making process for treatment selection include surgeon and patient preferences, costs of treatment, and the disparate complication profiles of these two treatments. TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic II.",0
HTA community perspectives on the use of patient preference information: lessons learned from a survey with members of HTA bodies.,"This research sought to assess whether and how patient preference (PP) data are currently used within health technology assessment (HTA) bodies and affiliated organizations involved in technology/drug appraisals and assessments. An exploratory survey was developed by the PP Project Subcommittee of the HTA International Patient and Citizen Involvement Interest Group to gain insight into the use, impact, and role of PP data in HTA, as well as the perceived barriers to its incorporation. Forty members of HTA bodies and affiliated organizations from twelve countries completed the online survey. PP data were reported to be formally considered as part of the HTA evidence review process by 82.5 percent of the respondents, while 39.4 percent reported that most of the appraisals and assessments within their organization in the past year had submitted PP data. The leading reason for why PP data were not submitted in most assessments was time/resource constraints followed by lack of clarity on PP data impact. Participants reported that PP data had a moderate level of influence on the deliberative process and outcome of the decision, but a higher level of influence on the decision's quality. Most (81.8 percent) felt patient advocacy groups should be primarily responsible for generating and submitting this type of evidence. Insights from the survey confirm the use of PP data in HTA but reveal barriers to its broader and more meaningful integration. Encouragingly, participants believe obstacles can be overcome, paving the way for a second phase of research involving in-depth collaborative workshops with HTA representatives.",0
Barriers and Facilitators to Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis by Men Who Have Sex with Men and Community Stakeholders in Malaysia.,"BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) in Malaysia are disproportionately affected by HIV. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an evidence-based HIV prevention strategy; yet, uptake remains low among Malaysian MSM, who have a limited understanding of barriers to PrEP. METHODS: We employed the nominal group technique (NGT), a structured mixed-methods strategy to understand the barriers and facilitators to PrEP use among Malaysian MSM, combined with a qualitative focus group. Six virtual focus group sessions, three among MSM (n = 20) and three among stakeholders (n = 16), were conducted using a video-conferencing platform. Rank-ordering of barriers from NGT was recorded, and thematic analysis was conducted for content. RESULTS: Similar barriers were reported by MSM and community stakeholders, with aggregated costs associated with PrEP care (e.g., consultation with a clinician, medication, laboratory testing) being the greatest barrier, followed by limited knowledge and awareness of PrEP. Additionally, the lack of access to PrEP providers, the complex clinical protocol for PrEP initiation and follow-up, and social stigma undermined PrEP delivery. Qualitative discussions identified potential new strategies to overcome these barriers, including expanded outreach efforts to reach hard-to-reach MSM, a 'one-stop' delivery model for PrEP services, a patient-centered decision aid to guide PrEP uptake, and easy access to LGBT-friendly PrEP providers. CONCLUSION: Current barriers may be overcome through governmental subsidy for PrEP and evidence-informed shared decision aids to support both MSM and PrEP providers.",0
Utility of Platelet-Rich Plasma Therapy in the Management of Meniscus Injuries: A narrative review.,"Menisci are crucial for knee joint functions and meniscal tears are common injuries, especially in sports activities. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which enhances healing, has emerged as a promising additive treatment for meniscus injuries, utilizing the regenerative properties of platelets and growth factors for improved clinical outcomes. In studies with a follow-up period of less than one year, the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy for meniscus injuries showed significant improvements in knee symptoms and daily activity. Patients experienced enhanced outcomes in terms of pain reduction and increased sports activity, with MRI scans indicating stable meniscus conditions after six months. Studies with a follow-up of more than one year, however, did not find significant differences between groups treated with PRP and groups not treated with PRP in terms of various outcome measures, including pain and knee function. The vascularization of the menisci is vital for their proper function, and insufficient blood supply can affect healing of meniscal injuries. PRP therapy is used to enhance meniscal healing by introducing growth factors and anti-inflammatory agents. PRP therapy may enable athletes with meniscal tears to return to sports more quickly and has less rehabilitation duration. While PRP seems promising as an alternative to failed treatment or as an adjunct to treatment in the short term, its long-term effectiveness remains inconclusive. Patient preferences, commitment to therapy rehabilitation, and cost should all be considered on an individual basis.",0
First-Trimester Screening Program for the Risk of Pre-eclampsia Using a Multiple-Marker Algorithm: A Health Technology Assessment.,"BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia is when high blood pressure develops after 20 weeks of pregnancy and either proteinuria, maternal end-organ dysfunction, or uteroplacental dysfunction causing fetal growth restriction also develops. The Fetal Medicine Foundation has created an algorithm (""the FMF algorithm"") that uses maternal factors in combination with biophysical and biochemical markers to identify people at high risk for pre-eclampsia so that they can been offered acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) as a preventive measure. We conducted a health technology assessment to evaluate the safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of a first-trimester population-wide screening program for pre-eclampsia risk that uses the FMF algorithm (""the FMF-based screening program""). We also evaluated the accuracy of the FMF algorithm, the budget impact of publicly funding the population-wide FMF-based screening program, and patient preferences and values. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each study using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions tool and the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-Comparative tool, and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature search and conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the FMF-based screening program to standard care (screening for risk of pre-eclampsia using maternal factors alone) from a public payer perspective. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding a population-wide FMF-based screening program in Ontario. We spoke with people who have experience with pregnancy and preeclampsia and their family members through direct interviews to gather preferences and values surrounding pre-eclampsia and the potential screening program. RESULTS: We included nine studies in the clinical evidence review. The FMF-based screening program likely reduces the risk of pre-eclampsia with delivery at less than 37 weeks' gestation compared with standard care, when initiated at 11+(0) to 13+(6) weeks' gestation; risk ratios ranged from 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-0.93) to 0.70 (95% CI 0.58-0.84) (GRADE: Moderate). It may reduce the risks of low birth weight (risk ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.85-0.94]) and low Apgar score (risk ratio 0.73 [95% CI 0.63-0.85]) (GRADE: Low). Evidence on the effectiveness of the FMF-based screening program in reducing the risk of stillbirth and neonatal death was highly uncertain (GRADE: Very low). In addition, the FMF algorithm can improve the detection rate of pre-eclampsia with delivery at less than 37 weeks' gestation or at less than 34 weeks' gestation compared with conventional algorithms, although there are concerns about bias and applicability across studies. The population-wide FMF-based screening program is more effective and more costly than standard care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the population-wide FMF-based screening program compared with standard care is $3,446 per prevented case of pre-eclampsia with delivery at less than 37 weeks. The annual budget impact of publicly funding the population-wide FMF-based screening program in Ontario ranges from an additional $1.23 million in year 1 to $3.56 million in year 5, for a total of $8.50 million over the next 5 years. The population-wide FMF-based screening program was seen as valuable by those who have experienced pregnancy and their family members. Strong emphasis was placed on providing education and equitable access as part of any screening program, and participants valued the potential clinical benefits that the population-wide FMF-based screening program could provide. CONCLUSIONS: The FMF-based screening program is likely more effective than standard care in reducing the risk of pre-eclampsia with delivery at less than 37 weeks' gestation. Also, the FMF algorithm can improve the detection rate of pre-eclampsia with delivery at less than 37 weeks' gestation or at less than 34 weeks' gestation when compared with conventional algorithms. The population-wide FMF-based screening program is more effective and more costly than standard care. We estimate that publicly funding the population-wide FMF-based screening program in Ontario would result in additional costs of $8.50 million over the next 5 years. Pregnant people and their family members valued the potential equitable access, information, and clinical benefits that the population-wide FMF-based screening program could provide.",0
Use of Patient Preferences Data Regarding Multiple Risks to Inform Regulatory Decisions.,"Background and Objectives. Risk-tolerance measures from patient-preference studies typically focus on individual adverse events. We recently introduced an approach that extends maximum acceptable risk (MAR) calculations to simultaneous maximum acceptable risk thresholds (SMART) for multiple treatment-related risks. We extend these methods to include the computation and display of confidence intervals and apply the approach to 3 published discrete-choice experiments to evaluate its utility to inform regulatory decisions. Methods. We generate MAR estimates and SMART curves and compare them with trial-based benefit-risk profiles of select treatments for depression, psoriasis, and thyroid cancer. Results. In the depression study, SMART curves with 70% to 95% confidence intervals portray which combinations of 2 adverse events would be considered acceptable. In the psoriasis example, the asymmetric confidence intervals for the SMART curve indicate that relying on independent MARs versus SMART curves when there are nonlinear preferences can lead to decisions that could expose patients to greater risks than they would accept. The thyroid cancer application shows an example in which the clinical incidence of each of 3 adverse events is lower than the single-event MARs for the expected treatment benefit, yet the collective risk profile surpasses acceptable levels when considered jointly. Limitations. Nonrandom sample of studies. Conclusions. When evaluating conventional MARs in which the observed incidences are near the estimated MARs or where preferences demonstrate diminishing marginal disutility of risk, conventional MAR estimates will overstate risk acceptance, which could lead to misinformed decisions, potentially placing patients at greater risk of adverse events than they would accept. Implications. The SMART method, herein extended to include confidence intervals, provides a reproducible, transparent evidence-based approach to enable decision makers to use data from discrete-choice experiments to account for multiple adverse events. HIGHLIGHTS: Estimates of maximum acceptable risk (MAR) for a defined treatment benefit can be useful to inform regulatory decisions; however, the conventional metric considers one adverse event at a time.This article applies a new approach known as SMART (simultaneous maximum acceptable risk thresholds) that accounts for multiple adverse events to 3 published discrete-choice experiments.Findings reveal that conventional MARs could lead decision makers to accept a treatment based on individual risks that would not be acceptable if multiple risks are considered simultaneously.",1
Determinants of Clinical Decision Making under Uncertainty in Dentistry: A Scoping Review.,"Clinical decision-making for diagnosing and treating oral and dental diseases consolidates multiple sources of complex information, yet individual clinical judgements are often made intuitively on limited heuristics to simplify decision making, which may lead to errors harmful to patients. This study aimed at systematically evaluating dental practitioners' clinical decision-making processes during diagnosis and treatment planning under uncertainty. A scoping review was chosen as the optimal study design due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the topic. Key terms and a search strategy were defined, and the articles published in the repository of the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE/PubMed) were searched, selected, and analysed in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Of the 478 studies returned, 64 relevant articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. Studies that were included were based in 27 countries, with the majority from the UK and USA. Articles were dated from 1991 to 2022, with all being observational studies except four, which were experimental studies. Six major recurring themes were identified: clinical factors, clinical experience, patient preferences and perceptions, heuristics and biases, artificial intelligence and informatics, and existing guidelines. These results suggest that inconsistency in treatment recommendations is a real possibility and despite great advancements in dental science, evidence-based practice is but one of a multitude of complex determinants driving clinical decision making in dentistry. In conclusion, clinical decisions, particularly those made individually by a dental practitioner, are potentially prone to sub-optimal treatment and poorer patient outcomes.",0
Editorial Commentary: Surgical Videos on YouTube Are Not Peer Reviewed and Have Low Educational Value.,"The rise of online platforms like YouTube for health information has prompted scrutiny over the quality of medical/surgical-related video content. Recent research on YouTube videos regarding anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with quadriceps tendon autograft shows low educational quality and reliability using established assessment tools. Physicians primarily published content, with longer videos, and physician-generated videos, generally correlating with higher quality. However, YouTube's inadequacy as a reliable source for ACLR information underscores the need for alternative educational resources. Orthopaedic health care professionals must play a pivotal role in guiding patients toward credible sources and take aim at improving online content quality. Understanding patient preferences for online resources is essential for enhancing patient education, the patient-provider relationship, and decision-making in orthopaedic care.",0
Toenail Onychomycosis with or without Diabetes in Canada: Patient Treatment Preferences and Health State Utilities.,"BACKGROUND: Toenail onychomycosis affects approximately 6.7% of Canadians. Symptoms include nail discolouration/disfiguration and pain; psychosocial impacts contribute to reduced health-related quality-of-life. Comorbid diabetes increases the risk of complications and exacerbates burden. Treatment may include topical therapy and/or oral agents. PURPOSE: To understand toenail onychomycosis treatment preferences, and to quantify the impact of toenail onychomycosis, with or without diabetes, on patient well-being. METHODS: Adults living in Canada with self-reported, physician-diagnosed, toenail onychomycosis were recruited online. A discrete choice experiment was used to quantify treatment preferences. Scenarios were randomized; data were analyzed using conditional logit regression. Health state utilities were estimated using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3(®). Results were stratified by diabetes status and toenail onychomycosis severity; the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to assess between-group utility differences. RESULTS: Three-hundred thirteen participants with toenail onychomycosis were included (161 had comorbid diabetes; 61.3%, severe onychomycosis). The mean age was 57.7 years; 55.9% were male. Treatment attributes with statistically significant impacts on patient preferences were efficacy (odds ratio [OR],1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.05 per 1% increased treatment success), administration method (one pill versus topical nail lacquer reference, 1.14; 1.04-1.26; topical solution applicator versus reference: 1.15; 1.03-1.29), severe adverse events (0.85; 0.80-0.90 per 1% increased risk), and risk of potential pharmacodynamic (0.80; 0.76-0.85) and alcohol (0.93; 0.88-0.98) interactions; preferences were more pronounced for efficacy and avoiding severe adverse events among toenail onychomycosis patients with comorbid diabetes. The mean (95% CI) utility value was 0.73 (0.70-0.75) overall, and statistically significantly lower (p=0.02) for toenail onychomycosis patients with diabetes (0.70; CI, 0.66-0.73) than those without (0.76; CI, 0.72-0.79). CONCLUSION: Among patients with toenail onychomycosis, the presence of diabetes was associated with differing treatment-related preferences. Utility values for patients with toenail onychomycosis represent a significant decline from full health that is exacerbated by comorbid diabetes.",1
Physical function and severe side effects matter most to patients with RA (< 5 years): a discrete choice experiment assessing preferences for personalized RA treatment.,"AIM: Early assessment of patient preferences has the potential to support shared decisions in personalized precision medicine for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to assess treatment preferences of patients with RA (< 5 years) with previous experience of inadequate response to first-line monotherapy. METHOD: Patients were recruited (March-June 2021) via four clinics in Sweden. Potential respondents (N = 933) received an invitation to answer a digital survey. The survey included an introductory part, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and demographic questions. Each respondent answered 11 hypothetical choice questions as part of the DCE. Patient preferences and preference heterogeneity were estimated using random parameter logit models and latent class analysis models. RESULTS: Patients (n = 182) assessed the most important treatment attributes out of physical functional capacity, psychosocial functional capacity, frequency of mild side effects and likelihood of severe side effects. In general, patients preferred a greater increase in functional capacity and decreased side effects. However, a substantial preference heterogeneity was identified with two underlying preference patterns. The most important attribute in the first pattern was the 'likelihood of getting a severe side effect'. Physical functional capacity was the most important attribute in the second pattern. CONCLUSION: Respondents focused their decision-making mainly on increasing their physical functional capacity or decreasing the likelihood of getting a severe side effect. These results are highly relevant from a clinical perspective to strengthen communication in shared decision making by assessing patients' individual preferences for benefits and risks in treatment discussions.",1
When attitudes and beliefs get in the way of shared decision-making: A mediation analysis of participation preference.,"INTRODUCTION: Certain sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., older age) have previously been identified as barriers to patients' participation preference in shared decision-making (SDM). We aim to demonstrate that this relationship is mediated by the perceived power imbalance that manifests itself in patients' negative attitudes and beliefs about their role in decision-making. METHODS: We recruited a large sample (N = 434) of outpatients with a range of urological diagnoses (42.2% urooncological). Before the medical consultation at a university hospital, patients completed the Patients' Attitudes and Beliefs Scale and the Autonomy Preference Index. We evaluated attitudes as a mediator between sociodemographic factors and participation preference in a path model. RESULTS: We replicated associations between relevant sociodemographic factors and participation preference. Importantly, attitudes and beliefs about one's own role as a patient mediated this relationship. The mediation path model explained a substantial proportion of the variance in participation preference (27.8%). Participation preferences and attitudes did not differ for oncological and nononcological patients. CONCLUSION: Patients' attitudes and beliefs about their role determine whether they are willing to participate in medical decision-making. Thus, inviting patients to participate in SDM should encompass an assessment of their attitudes and beliefs. Importantly, negative attitudes may be accessible to change. Unlike stable sociodemographic characteristics, such values are promising targets for interventions to foster more active participation in SDM. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: This study was part of a larger project on implementing SDM in urological practice. Several stakeholders were involved in the design, planning and conduction of this study, for example, three authors are practising urologists, and three are psychologists with experience in patient care. In addition, the survey was piloted with patients, and their feedback was integrated into the questionnaire. The data presented in this study is based on patients' responses. Results may help to empower our patients.",0
Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Before Radical Cystectomy for Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer: Elective and Eligibility Factors Impacting Utilization.,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to assess utilization of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and etiologies for lack of NAC receipt among patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). METHODS: Patients diagnosed with MIBC undergoing radical cystectomy at a single institution (2005-2021) were included. Patients were categorized by receipt of NAC, and reasons for no NAC were categorized into eligibility and elective factors. Overall survival was analyzed using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models and modeled with Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: Three hundred eighty patients with MIBC were included; 154 (40.5%) received NAC. Patients were not candidates for NAC due to renal dysfunction (16.6%), clinical contraindications (4.7%), salvage setting (2.1%), and histology (5.3%; total N = 109). Among 271 (71.3%) who were eligible, utilization increased from early (2005-2016) to recent (2016-2021) time periods (34.2% to 85.7% among NAC-eligible, P < .001; 22.8% vs 67.1% among all MIBC, P < .001). Elective factors for not receiving NAC included patient symptoms (7.8%), disease progression concern (7.0%), patient preference/refusal (20.3%) and provider discretion (8.1%) among 271 NAC-eligible patients. Notably, patient preference/refusal decreased from 33.6% to 3.4% in recent years (P < .001). On multivariable analysis, lack of NAC utilization due to renal dysfunction (HR 2.18, P = .002), clinical contraindications (HR 2.62, P = .01), and elective factors (HR 1.88, P = .01) were associated with worse overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: NAC utilization increased over time with 85.7% of eligible patients with MIBC receiving NAC in recent years. Renal dysfunction, patient preference, and clinical contraindications were primary etiologies for lack of NAC. Fewer patients refused NAC in recent years leading to a potential ceiling for NAC utilization.",0
Comparison of direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin in chronic limb-threatening ischemia.,"OBJECTIVE: The role of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in chronic limb-threatening ischemia after revascularization is unknown. Current evidence-based guidelines do not provide clear guidance on the role of anticoagulation or the selection of anticoagulant. Current practice is highly varied and based on provider and patient preference. The purpose of this study was to measure the impact of different anticoagulants on the incidence of major adverse limb events (MALEs) after revascularization for chronic limb-threatening ischemia, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for major bleeding events. METHODS: This was a single-center, observational, retrospective cohort study. Subjects were eligible if they were 18 years or older; underwent endovascular or open revascularization for chronic limb-threatening ischemia, rest pain, or tissue loss; and were subsequently prescribed apixaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin. The primary end point was the incidence of MALEs, including above-ankle amputation or major index-limb reintervention, within 1 year of index event. Secondary end points included the rate of all-cause mortality, MACEs, and incidence of International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) major bleeding. RESULTS: From January 1, 2017, to September 20, 2022, 141 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were reviewed. The median age was 67 years, with 92 patients prescribed apixaban or rivaroxaban and 49 patients prescribed warfarin. Of these, 42 patients were prescribed triple antithrombotic therapy, 88 dual antithrombotic therapy, and 13 anticoagulant monotherapy. The primary outcome of 1-year MALEs occurred in 36.7% of the warfarin group and 33.7% of the DOAC group (relative risk [RR], 1.09; 95% CI, 0.53-2.25; P = .72). Secondary outcomes of 1-year MACEs (10.2% vs 4.3%; RR, 2.35; 95% CI, 0.60-9.18; P = .18) and 1-year all-cause mortality (26.5% vs 16.3%; RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 0.70-3.78; P = .15) did not differ between the groups. The secondary safety outcome of 1-year ISTH major bleeding occurred in 16.3% of the warfarin group and 4.3% of the DOAC group (RR, 3.76; 95% CI, 1.07-13.19; P = .015). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia who were revascularized and prescribed anticoagulation with apixaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin on discharge, no difference in MALEs, MACEs, or all-cause mortality was found. However, 1-year admissions for ISTH major bleeding were significantly higher among patients prescribed warfarin. A randomized trial may confirm these findings.",0
Research Knowledge Translation in Sensory Integration-Based Therapy: Exploring Subjectivity of Clinical Expertise.,"Background. Clinical expertise is the mechanism through which practitioners implement other components of evidence-based practice (EBP). Within occupational therapy practice, intervention approaches that are both closely and loosely aligned with Ayres' Theory of Sensory Integration are widespread, offering a unique opportunity to investigate the subjective nature of clinical expertise in EBP. Purpose. This qualitative study explored motivations to offer sensory integration-based interventions, and factors informing occupational therapists' clinical decision making in relation to an arguably contentious evidence base. Method. Six post-graduate sensory integration trained UK occupational therapists participated in individual semi-structured interviews. Interviews were transcribed, member-checked and analyzed using thematic coding analysis. Findings. Despite sound understanding of theory and continuous efforts to develop clinical knowledge, non-traditional hierarchies of evidence notably inform clinical decisions. The clinical expertise required for integration of patient preferences, clinical state and circumstances, and research evidence is informed by pragmatic responses to facilitators and barriers across contexts, combined with unique profession-specific identity factors. Implications. While empirical healthcare research is ideally undertaken under controlled conditions, realities of clinical practice are rarely so clear cut. Study findings highlight important subjective factors that are central to real-world research knowledge translation and further understanding of the clinical expertise component of EBP.",0
Early Pregnancy Loss Management in the Emergency Department vs Outpatient Setting.,"IMPORTANCE: Early pregnancy loss (EPL), or miscarriage, is the most common complication of early pregnancy, and many patients experiencing EPL present to the emergency department (ED). Little is known about how patients who present to the ED with EPL differ from those who present to outpatient clinics and how their management and outcomes differ. OBJECTIVE: To compare the management and outcomes of patients with EPL who present to the ED vs outpatient clinics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used the IBM MarketScan Research Database, a national insurance claims database. Participants were pregnant people aged 15 to 49 years in the US who presented to either an ED or outpatient clinic for initial diagnosis of EPL from October 2015 through December 2019. Data analysis was performed from May 2021 to March 2022. EXPOSURES: The primary exposure was location of service (ED vs outpatient clinic). Other exposures of interest included demographic characteristics, current pregnancy history, and comorbidities. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was EPL management type (surgical, medication, or expectant management). Complications, including blood transfusion and hospitalization, and characteristics associated with location of service were also evaluated. Bivariable analyses and multivariable logistic regression were used for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 117 749 patients with EPL diagnoses were identified, with a mean (SD) age of 31.8 (6.1) years. Of these patients, 20 826 (17.7%) initially presented to the ED, and 96 923 (82.3%) presented to outpatient clinics. Compared with the outpatient setting, patients in the ED were less likely to receive surgical (2925 patients [14.0%] vs 23 588 patients [24.3%]) or medication (1116 patients [5.4%] vs 10 878 patients [11.2%]) management. In the adjusted analysis, characteristics associated with decreased odds of active (surgical or medication) vs expectant management included ED (vs outpatient) presentation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.44-0.47), urban location (aOR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82-0.91), and being a dependent on an insurance policy (vs primary policy holder) (aOR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.67-0.74); whereas older age (aOR per 1-year increase 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.01), established prenatal care (aOR, 2.35; 95% CI, 2.29-2.42), and medical comorbidities (aOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09) were associated with increased odds of receiving active management. Patients in the ED were more likely than those in outpatient clinics to need a blood transfusion (287 patients [1.4%] vs 202 patients [0.2%]) or hospitalization (463 patients [2.2%] vs 472 patients [0.5%]), but complications were low regardless of location of service. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of privately insured patients with EPL, differences in management between the ED vs outpatient setting may reflect barriers to accessing comprehensive EPL management options. More research is needed to understand these significant differences in management approaches by practice setting, and to what extent EPL management reflects patient preferences in both outpatient and ED settings.",0
"A cross-sectional study evaluating the knowledge, attitude, and practice of evidence-based medicine among resident doctors of a health-care Institution of National Importance in India.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promotes the integration of updated- best evidence with patient preferences and medical expertise for clinical decision-making. Despite the availability of high-quality evidence such as systematic review and meta-analysis, some clinicians manage their patients based on past experiences and expert opinion. Thus, this study was proposed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of EBM among resident doctors at a tertiary care hospital in India. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted among senior residents and final-year postgraduates (PGs) who were independently involved in clinical decision-making. By convenience sampling method, the participants were recruited, and the validated EBM Questionnaire (EBMQ) was distributed online for assessing the knowledge, attitude, and practice of EBM. Descriptive statistics were represented as frequency and proportions. RESULTS: A total of 102 resident doctors participated with male preponderance (74.5%). Nearly, 96 (94.1%) participants were already practicing EBM and 21.6% had undergone EBM training. Textbooks (50%) were the most often referred sources for EBM information. Specific EBM databases such as MEDLINE and Cochrane were also utilized by 37.3% of participants. More than 70% of participants understood the terms such as a randomized controlled trial, case-control study, and P value. A higher proportion (80.4%) of participants showed a positive attitude about patient care improved by EBM. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the resident doctors exhibited good knowledge and a positive attitude toward applying EBM in clinical decision-making. Periodic training through workshops or courses and integration of EBM with the PG curriculum would potentially enhance the EBM practice.",0
Patient Preferences and Their Effects on Rehabilitation Outcomes: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of aligning patients' preferences with specific rehabilitation delivery modes on rehabilitation outcomes. DESIGN: A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: The study cohort comprised 208 patients referred for physiotherapy rehabilitation after non-surgical or surgical interventions for rotator cuff injury, shoulder impingement, or acromioclavicular osteoarthritis. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three rehabilitation modalities: 1) group-based exercise, 2) individual exercise, or 3) home exercise. In this study, participants were categorized into two groups: ""matched preference"" (MP) and ""unmatched preference"" (UP). The primary outcome measure was change in function, measured with the shortened Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH). Secondary outcome measures were change in pain, assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), mental well-being measured with the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), health-related quality of life assessed using the EuroQol-5Domain questionnaire (EQ-5D), fear avoidance assessed using the Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire (ÖMPQ), and overall treatment satisfaction. Outcomes were assessed at 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: The primary outcome measure, QuickDASH, showed no significant differences between groups at either 3 months (-3.0 [-8.2 to 2.3]) or 6 months (0.5 [-5.7 to 6.7]). Additionally, no significant differences were observed in the secondary outcome measures. CONCLUSION: Matching patients' preferences for specific rehabilitation delivery modes did not seem to effect rehabilitation outcomes.",0
Discrete Choice Experiment to Understand Japanese Patients' and Physicians' Preferences for Preventive Treatments for Migraine.,"INTRODUCTION: Self-injectable calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibody (mAb) auto-injectors and non-CGRP oral medications are currently available for migraine prevention in Japan. This study elicited the preferences for self-injectable CGRP mAbs and non-CGRP oral medications and determined differences in the relative importance of auto-injector attributes for patients and physicians in Japan. METHODS: Japanese adults with episodic (EM) or chronic (CM) migraine and physicians who treat migraine completed an online discrete choice experiment (DCE), asking participants to choose a hypothetical treatment they preferred between two self-injectable CGRP mAb auto-injectors and a non-CGRP oral medication. The treatments were described by seven treatment attributes, with attribute levels varying between questions. DCE data were analyzed using a random-constant logit model to estimate relative attribution importance (RAI) scores and predicted choice probabilities (PCP) of CGRP mAb profiles. RESULTS: A total of 601 patients (79.2% with EM, 60.1% female, mean age: 40.3 years) and 219 physicians (mean length of practice: 18.3 years) completed the DCE. About half (50.5%) of patients favored CGRP mAb auto-injectors, while others were skeptical of (20.2%) or averse (29.3%) to them. Patients most valued needle removal (RAI = 33.8%), shorter injection duration (RAI = 32.1%), and auto-injector base shape and need for skin pinching (RAI = 23.2%). Most physicians (87.8%) favored auto-injectors over non-CGRP oral medications. Physicians most valued less-frequent dosing RAI = 32.7%), shorter injection duration (30.4%), and longer storage outside the fridge (RAI = 20.3%). A profile comparable to galcanezumab showed a higher likelihood of being chosen by patients (PCP = 42.8%) than profiles comparable to erenumab (PCP = 28.4%) and fremanezumab (PCP = 28.8%). The PCPs of the three profiles were similar among physicians. CONCLUSION: Many patients and physicians preferred CGRP mAb auto-injectors over non-CGRP oral medications and preferred a treatment profile similar to galcanezumab. Our results may encourage physicians in Japan to consider patient preferences when recommending migraine preventive treatments.",1
Aortic Stenosis Phenotypes and Precision Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.,"Patients with a clinical indication for aortic valve replacement can either undergo surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). There are many different factors that go into determining which type of replacement to undergo, including age, life expectancy, comorbidities, frailty, and patient preference. While both options offer significant benefits to patients in terms of clinical outcomes and quality of life, there is growing interest in expanding the indications for TAVI due to its minimally invasive approach. However, it is worth noting that there are several discrepancies in TAVI outcomes in regards to various endpoints, including death, stroke, and major cardiovascular events. It is unclear why these discrepancies exist, but potential explanations include the diversity of etiologies for aortic stenosis, complex patient comorbidities, and ongoing advancements in both medical therapies and devices. Of these possibilities, we propose that phenotypic variation of aortic stenosis has the most significant impact on post-TAVI clinical outcomes. Such variability in phenotypes is often due to a complex interplay between underlying comorbidities and environmental and inherent patient risk factors. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that patient genetics may also play a role in aortic stenosis pathology. As such, we propose that the selection and management of TAVI patients should emphasize a precision medicine approach.",0

Attitudes towards disposition of cryopreserved sperm in the event of death.,"INTRODUCTION: To evaluate patient preference for sperm disposition in case of death based on demographic factors and infertility etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed at a university hospital-affiliated fertility center. Charts of 550 men undergoing cryopreservation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) between 2016-2019 were reviewed to create a descriptive dataset. Patients previously signed consent forms stating their preference for sperm transfer to their partner or disposal in the event of their subsequent death. Patients undergoing sperm cryopreservation for the purpose of ART were analyzed to assess associations between demographic characteristics and etiology of infertility and their choice to either transfer sperm to their partner or discard. RESULTS: A total of 84.9% (342/403) of patients included in final analyses elected to transfer their sperm to their partner in the event of their death. Factors associated with a significantly increased likelihood to transfer versus discard included a male-factor infertility diagnosis compared to female-factor infertility diagnosis (transfer rate 89.3% vs. 79.9%; p = .022) and commercial insurance coverage versus non-commercial/no insurance coverage (transfer rate 86.3% vs. 75.0%, p = .029). No significant differences relating to age, race/ethnicity, occupation classification, marital status or duration of marriage, or prior paternity were found. CONCLUSION: A majority of male patients seeking sperm cryopreservation for ART elected to transfer their sperm to their partner if future death should occur. There does not appear to be a clear factor that would impact this decision based on demographic characteristics.",0
Perspectives of hospitalized heart failure patients: preferred and perceived participation roles in treatment decisions.,"Shared decision-making (SDM) is a pivotal process in seeking optimal individual treatment and incorporating clinical evidence and patients' autonomous preferences. However, patients' actual attitudes toward participation in decision-making for state-of-the-art heart failure (HF) treatment remain unclear. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey distributed by nurses and physicians specializing in HF care to assess patients' preferred and perceived participation roles in treatment decision-making during the index hospitalization, rated on five scales (from extremely passive to purely autonomous attitudes). Simultaneously, we investigated the important factors underlying treatment decision-making from the perspective of hospitalized HF patients. Of the 202 patients who were approached by our multidisciplinary HF team between 2017 and 2020, 166 (82.2%) completed the survey. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the clinical determinants of patients who reported that they left all decisions to physicians (i.e., extremely passive attitude). Of the 166 participants (male 67.5%, median age 73 years), 32.5% preferred an extremely passive attitude, while 61.4% reported that they actually chose an extremely passive attitude. A sole determinant of choosing an extremely passive decision-making role was lower educational status (odds ratio: 2.11, 95% confidence interval 1.11-4.00). The most important factor underlying the decision-making was ""Physician recommendation"" (89.2%). Notably, less than 50% considered ""In alignment with my values and preferences"" as an important factor underlying treatment decision-making. The majority of HF patients reported that they chose an extremely passive approach, and patients prioritized physician recommendation over their own values and preferences.",0
ADCC's Improving Goal Concordant Care Initiative: Implementing Primary Palliative Care Principles.,"BACKGROUND: High-quality, timely goals of care communication (GOCC) may improve patient and caregiver outcomes and promote care that is consistent with patient preferences. PROBLEM: Cancer patients, and their loved ones, appreciate GOCC; however, oncologists often lack formal communication training, institutional support and structures necessary to promote the delivery, documentation, and longitudinal follow-up of GOCC. PROPOSED SOLUTION: The Alliance of Dedicated Cancer Centers (ADCC), representing 10 U.S. academic cancer hospitals, undertook the Improving Goal Concordant Care Initiative (IGCC). This national, 3-year implementation initiative was designed in Fall 2019 by a workgroup of quality, oncology, and palliative care leaders, as well as patient and family advisory committee members (PFAC). IGCC addresses systemic gaps by requiring four core components for participation: 1) Implementation of a formal communication skills training (CST) program, 2) Structured GOCC documentation in the electronic medical record that is visible to all clinicians, 3) Expectations regarding the timing and patient populations for GOCC, and 4) Implementation of a measurement framework. METHOD: Dyads of palliative and oncology leaders committed to attend regularly scheduled, ADCC-led, virtual meetings during the design and implementation phase, incorporating PFAC feedback at every stage. Using the RE-AIM framework, we describe process and outcome evaluation measures defined by implementation and measures workgroups and collected routinely, including: CST completion; trainee evaluation response rate, trainee-reported quality of CST, trainee changes in self-efficacy and distress; percent of high-priority patients participating in GOCC, and patient-reported response to the ""Heard and Understood"" scale (HU). IGCC's impact will be assessed using claims-based utilization metrics near the end of life (EOLM) and followed longitudinally. Qualitative evaluations near the completion of IGCC will provide insight into perceived barriers, enabling factors, and sustainability. OUTCOMES: Implementation of all IGCC components has begun at all sites. ADCC-wide, 35% of MD/DOs have completed CST (range by site: 8%-100%). CST is highly rated; in Quarter 3, 2022, 93%-100%, 90%-100% and 87%-100% of respondents reported above average to excellent CST quality, likelihood to use the skills and likelihood to recommend CST to others, respectively. Clinician self-efficacy and distress ratings are expected in late 2023. All sites have identified patient populations and continue to refine automated triggers and timelines; uptake of GOCC documentation has been slow. Eight of 10 sites have submitted patient-reported HU data. EOLM data are expected for all sites in early 2024. LESSONS LEARNED: Flexibility in implementation with shared definitions, measures, and learnings about approaches optimizes the ability of all centers to collaborate and make progress in improving GOCC. Flexibility adds to the complexity of understanding intervention effectiveness, the critical intervention components and the fidelity necessary to achieve specific outcomes.",0
"Kidney biopsy in diabetic kidney disease. Yes, but in very selected cases.","The debate on kidney biopsy in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is multifaceted. Loreto Gesualdo and colleagues argue for its broader application, claiming that biopsies can offer precise diagnostic data and guide personalized treatment plans. On the other hand, Alberto Ortiz opposes this, citing insufficient evidence, resource constraints and potential risks. He suggests that alternative diagnostic methods, such as advanced imaging techniques and serological markers, will obviate the need for biopsy in most patients. Both sides agree on the need for individualized patient care, and open discussions between healthcare providers and patients about the procedure's risks and benefits. The application of kidney biopsy in these patients needs to consider clinical evidence, practical limitations and patient preferences, and demands a balanced, case-by-case approach. Overall, this moderator believes that, although fundamental in clinical research, kidney biopsy in DKD is infrequently needed.",0
Indiana Pouch Continent Cutaneous Urinary Diversion After Robotic-assisted Radical Cystectomy: A 16-Year Experience.,"BACKGROUND: Population-based practice patterns in the United States reveal continent diversions are only performed in 8%-10.4% of patients.(1-4) Ideally, for patients undergoing radical cystectomy the choice of urinary diversion should be influenced by clinical factors and patient preference, with discussions surrounding quality of life. Unfortunately, receipt of continent diversion has been shown to be influenced by a plethora of other factors such as surgeon preference/training, geography, socioeconomic status, gender, and hospital volume.(1-3) Thus, by providing detailed instruction and long-term follow-up, we hope to mitigate some of these disparities by changing the perceptions regarding feasibility and complications of continent diversions. OBJECTIVE: To provide step-by-step instruction and to report long-term clinical outcomes in bladder cancer patients receiving an Indiana pouch continent cutaneous urinary diversion (CCUD) after robot-assisted radical cystectomy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: After Institutional Review Board approval, a prospectively maintained bladder cancer database was queried for patients with T1-T4, N0-N1, M0 bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy with CCUD at a tertiary referral center from 2004 to 2020. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Complications at 30- and 90-day were recorded according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Continence rates were recorded by chart review. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 97 patients were included with a median follow-up of 93months. Clinically, 91.8% had ≤T2 disease and 29.9% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The median length of surgery was 8.0 hours, length of hospital stay was 8.3days, and urinary continence rate was 99.0%. The overall complication rate was 73.2% and 76.5% at 30- and 90-day, respectively. The major complication rate (Clavien III-V) was 17.5% at 30-day and 22.7% at 90-day. The most common major complications were abdominal infection and uretero-colonic stricture. The readmission rate was 21.4% and median overall survival was 108months. CONCLUSION: CCUD provides exceptional functional outcomes with acceptable complication rates compared to other diversion types. CCUD is a reliable reconstructive option and with this step-by-step video as a reference, we hope it will be offered to more patients.",0
"Provider perspectives on patient-centered contraceptive counseling for Latinas in Baltimore, MD.","OBJECTIVES: To explore: 1) provider narratives of their contraceptive counseling practices with Latina patients within the context of patient-centered care (PCC); and 2) provider perceptions about the barriers to the provision of patient-centered contraceptive counseling in general and more specifically, with Latina patients in Baltimore, MD. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted 25 semistructured qualitative interviews with physicians  and nurse practitioners from four specialties who provide contraceptive care to Latinas in Baltimore, MD. We analyzed data using directed content analysis. We discuss findings with attention to major constructs of PCC, applying a reproductive justice framework. RESULTS: Providers described a contraceptive counseling approach focused on pregnancy prevention as the primary goal. Most respondents used a tiered-effectiveness approach, even while noting the importance of PCC. Providers noted health system barriers to PCC, including time constraints and insurance status. Provider-reported patient-attributed barriers included low patient education/health literacy, culturally-attributed misconceptions about contraception, and language discordance. CONCLUSION: Providers described knowledge of and intention to practice PCC but had limited integration of it in their own counseling with Latinas. Responses suggest tension between an expressed desire to provide PCC and paternalistic counseling paradigms that prioritize pregnancy prevention over patient preferences. Inequitable health system barriers also interfere with true implementation of contraceptive PCC. IMPLICATIONS: Translating contraceptive PCC into practice, especially for marginalized communities, is paramount. Training should teach clinicians to recognize systems of structural inequity and discrimination that have informed approaches to counseling but are not reflective of PCC. Institutional policies must address health system barriers that also hamper PCC.",0
A Longitudinal Evaluation of the Preferences of Patients With Advanced Cancer for Quality of Life and Survival in Malaysia: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to quantify the preferences of patients with advanced cancer for quality of life (QoL) outcomes versus survival extension in Malaysia. The secondary aim of this study is to explore the change in preferences over time. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was developed to include 7 attributes valued in cancer management: physical, psychological and social functioning, pain control, survival, place of death, and cost. Patients were recruited via convenience sampling from 2 Malaysian public hospitals. The survey questionnaire was administered to patients within 6 months of their cancer diagnosis with a follow-up 3 months later. Conditional logit regression was used to estimate the preference weight, relative attribute importance, and willingness to pay. RESULTS: One hundred valid responses were collected at baseline and 45 at follow-up. Respondents placed higher values on QoL improvements from severe to moderate or mild levels and to achieve home death over survival extension from 6 to 18 months. However, additional improvements (from moderate to mild) in some of the QoL outcomes were not valued as highly as life extension from 12 to 18 months, showing that it was vital for patients to avoid being in ""severe"" health dysfunction. Improving physical dysfunction from severe to mild yielded 3 times as much value as additional 1-year survival. After 3 months, the respondents' preferences changed significantly, with increased relative attribute importance of physical functioning, pain control, and cost. CONCLUSIONS: As QoL outcomes are valued more than survival, palliative care should be introduced as early as possible to alleviate suffering related to advanced cancer.",1
A Novel Approach to Computing Preference Estimates for Different Treatment Pathways: An Application in Oncology.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer may progress through multiple treatments with differing adverse effect profiles. Moreover, pathways may be fixed or flexible in allowing for escalation or de-escalation of treatment depending on interim outcomes. We sought to develop a methodology capable of estimating preferences for the entirety of a pathway involving a sequence of different treatments. METHODS: Patients with early breast cancer completed an online discrete choice experiment to assess preferences for eight key early breast cancer attributes. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling was used to calculate attribute-level preference weights. Preference weights for hypothetical pathways were estimated by summing the respective weights for efficacy, flexible or fixed pathway, duration, administration regimen, and adverse event risk, the last two of which were time-adjusted by multiplying each weight by the proportion of time spent on a selected treatment. RESULTS: Increases in the risk of a serious adverse event were most influential in treatment pathway preferences, followed by increases in efficacy and decreases in overall pathway duration. Patients preferred a flexible pathway versus a fixed pathway. Pathway preference estimates fluctuated in a logically consistent manner. Switching from a flexible to a fixed pathway yielded a significantly lower pathway preference. For this same pathway, when adjuvant treatment was replaced with a treatment with a more favorable toxicity profile and shorter duration, it offset the negative impact of the more toxic neoadjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This novel methodology accounts for patient preference throughout a sequence of treatments, allowing for comparison of preferences across complex treatment pathways.",1
Patient preferences for epilepsy treatment: a systematic review of discrete choice experimental studies.,"BACKGROUND: This review aimed to 1) identify and assess the quality of discrete choice experiments (DCEs) examining preferences related to epilepsy treatment; 2) summarize the attributes and attribute levels measured in these studies; 3) identify how researchers selected and developed these attributes; and 4) identify which attributes are most important for epilepsy patients. METHODS: A systematic literature review using PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases from database inception to February or April 2022. We included primary discrete-choice experiments eliciting preferences for various attributes of pharmacological and surgical interventions in patients diagnosed with epilepsy or the parents/carers of children with epilepsy. We excluded non- primary studies, studies assessing preferences for nonpharmacological treatment and studies that elicit preferences using methods other than discrete choice experiments. Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of studies. The quality of the included studies was assessed using two validated checklists. Study characteristics and findings were summarized descriptively. RESULTS: A total of seven studies were included in the review. The majority of studies explored patients' preferences, and two compared the preferences of patients with physicians. The majority (n = 6) compared two medications, and one compared two surgical options to continuing medication options. The studies examined 44 attributes in total, including side effects (n = 26), efficacy expressed as being seizure free or have fewer seizures (n = 8), costs (n = 3), dosing frequency (n = 3), duration of side effects (n = 2), mortality (n = 1), long-term problems after surgery (n = 1) and surgical options (n = 1). The findings indicate that people with epilepsy have strong preferences for improving seizure control, which was ranked as the top priority in all studies. Patients also have a strong preference for the reduction of adverse effects and may be willing to make trade-offs between improved seizure control and reduction of long-term side effects that may impact their quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: The use of DCEs in measuring patients' preference for epilepsy treatment is accumulating. However, inadequate reporting of methodological details may reduce decision-makers' confidence in the findings. Suggestions for future research are provided.",1
Racial and ethnic disparities in end-of-life care for patients with oesophageal cancer: death trends over time.,"BACKGROUND: Given significant morbidity and mortality associated with oesophageal cancer, supportive, high-quality end-of-life care is critical. Most patients with advanced cancer prefer to die at home, but incongruence between preferred and actual place of death is common. Here, we examined trends and disparities in location of death among patients with oesophageal cancer. METHODS: Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Range Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database, we utilized multinomial logistic regression to assess associations between sociodemographic characteristics and location of death for patients with oesophageal cancer (n = 237,063). Additionally, we utilized linear regression models to evaluate the significance of changes in location of death trends over time and disparities in the relative change in location of death trends across sociodemographic groups. FINDINGS: From 2003 to 2019, there was a decrease of deaths in hospitals, nursing homes, and outpatient medical facilities/emergency departments and an increase of deaths at home and in hospice. Relative to White decedents, Black and Asian decedents were less likely to die at home (relative risk ratio (RRR): 0.58 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-0.60], RRR: 0.57 [95% CI: 0.53-0.61]) and in hospice (RRR: 0.67 [95% CI: 0.64-0.71], RRR: 0.49 [95% CI: 0.43-0.55]) when compared to the hospital. Similar disparities were noted for American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) decedents. These disparities persisted even upon stratifying by the number of listed causes of death, a proxy for severity of illness. Time trend analysis indicated that increases in deaths in hospice over time occurred at a slower rate for AIAN and Asian decedents relative to White decedents. INTERPRETATION: 2 in 5 patients with oesophageal cancer die at home, with an increasing proportion dying at home and in hospice-in line with general patient preferences. However, location of death disparities have largely persisted over time among racial and ethnic minority groups. Our findings suggest the importance of improving access to advance care planning and delivering tailored, person-centred interventions. FUNDING: None.",0
Respiratory Management of Patients With Neuromuscular Weakness: An American College of Chest Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline and Expert Panel Report.,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory failure is a significant concern in neuromuscular diseases (NMDs). This CHEST guideline examines the literature on the respiratory management of patients with NMD to provide evidence-based recommendations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An expert panel conducted a systematic review addressing the respiratory management of NMD and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence and formulating and grading recommendations. A modified Delphi technique was used to reach a consensus on the recommendations. RESULTS: Based on 128 studies, the panel generated 15 graded recommendations, one good practice statement, and one consensus-based statement. INTERPRETATION: Evidence of best practices for respiratory management in NMD is limited and is based primarily on observational data in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The panel found that pulmonary function testing every 6 months may be beneficial and may be used to initiate noninvasive ventilation (NIV) when clinically indicated. An individualized approach to NIV settings may benefit patients with chronic respiratory failure and sleep-disordered breathing related to NMD. When resources allow, polysomnography or overnight oximetry can help to guide the initiation of NIV. The panel provided guidelines for mouthpiece ventilation, transition to home mechanical ventilation, salivary secretion management, and airway clearance therapies. The guideline panel emphasizes that NMD pathologic characteristics represent a diverse group of disorders with differing rates of decline in lung function. The clinician's role is to add evaluation at the bedside to shared decision-making with patients and families, including respect for patient preferences and treatment goals, considerations of quality of life, and appropriate use of available resources in decision-making.",0
Prioritizing Treatment Goals of People Diagnosed with Bipolar I Disorder in the US: Best-Worst Scaling Results.,"PURPOSE: Bipolar I disorder (BP-I) is associated with significant disease burden, but evidence on treatment goals in people diagnosed with BP-I is scarce. This study sought to quantify treatment goals related to the pharmacological management of BP-I in adults in the US and to identify if subgroups of people with similar treatment goals exist. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A best-worst scaling (BWS) of treatment goals was developed based on available literature and input from experts and patients and was distributed as part of a survey between August and September 2021. Survey participants were adults with a self-reported diagnosis of BP-I who were recruited via an online panel in the US. Participants were asked to prioritize the importance of 16 treatment goals using BWS. BWS scores were computed using multinomial logistic regression, with the scores across all goals summing to 100 for each participant. Subgroups of people with similar preferences were identified using latent class analysis. RESULTS: The most important treatment goals for people diagnosed with BP-I (N=255) were ""being less impulsive, angry, or irritable"" (score: 9.73), or being ""able to feel pleasure or happiness"" (score: 9.54). Goals related to reducing the incidence of various potential adverse events of medication (scores: ≤4.51) or ""reducing dependence on others"" (score: 3.04) were less important. Two subgroups were identified. One subgroup (n=111) prioritized symptom-focused goals, considering ""reducing frequency of mania, depression, and mixed episodes"" and ""being less impulsive, angry or irritable"" the most important (scores: 12.46 and 11.85, respectively). The other subgroup (n=144) placed significantly more importance on social functioning-focused goals, including beginning or maintaining a relationship with a partner/significant other, and with family and/or friends (scores: 8.45 and 7.70, respectively). CONCLUSION: People diagnosed with BP-I prioritized emotional improvements. Subgroups of people with BP-I prioritized either symptom-focused or social functioning-focused treatment goals.",1
Preferences Regarding Breast Surgery Omission Among Patients With Breast Cancer Who Receive Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Currently, several ongoing prospective studies are investigating the safety of breast surgery omission in patients with breast cancer who are exceptional responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, there is little information about the preferences of these patients regarding omission of breast surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a questionnaire survey to assess preferences regarding omission of breast surgery among patients with breast cancer who had human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive or estrogen receptor-negative tumors and good clinical response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients' estimation of the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after definitive surgery or breast surgery omission was also assessed. RESULTS: Of 93 patients, only 22 (23.7%) said they would omit breast surgery. Under the scenario of omitting breast surgery, the 5-year IBTR rate estimated by patients who said they would omit breast surgery was significantly lower (median, 10%) than the rate estimated by patients who preferred undergoing definitive surgery (median, 30%) (p=0.017). CONCLUSION: The proportion of our surveyed patients who were willing to omit breast surgery was low. Patients who said they preferred to omit breast surgery overestimated the 5-year IBTR risk.",1
Statement of the Spanish Interdisciplinary Vascular Prevention Committee on the updated European Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention.,"We present the Spanish adaptation of the 2021 European Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) prevention in clinical practice. The current guidelines besides the individual approach greatly emphasize on the importance of population level approaches to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Systematic global CVD risk assessment is recommended in individuals with any major vascular risk factor. Regarding LDL-Cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus, goals and targets remain as recommended in previous guidelines. However, it is proposed a new, stepwise approach (Step 1 and 2) to treatment intensification as a tool to help physicians and patients pursue these targets in a way that fits patient profile. After Step 1, considering proceeding to the intensified goals of Step 2 is mandatory, and this intensification will be based on 10-year CVD risk, lifetime CVD risk and treatment benefit, comorbidities and patient preferences. The updated SCORE algorithm-SCORE2, SCORE-OP- is recommended in these guidelines, which estimates an individual's 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD events (myocardial infarction, stroke) in healthy men and women aged 40-89 years. Another new and important recommendation is the use of different categories of risk according different age groups (< 50, 50-69, ≥70 years). Different flow charts of CVD risk and risk factor treatment in apparently healthy persons, in patients with established atherosclerotic CVD, and in diabetic patients are recommended. Patients with chronic kidney disease are considered high risk or very high-risk patients according to the levels of glomerular filtration rate and albumin-to-creatinine ratio. New lifestyle recommendations adapted to the ones published by the Spanish Ministry of Health as well as recommendations focused on the management of lipids, blood pressure, diabetes and chronic renal failure are included.",0
Medication Abortion Follow-Up Rates in a Rural Population Before and After Introduction of a Remote Follow-Up Option.,"Background: Medication abortion (MAB) follow-up historically involves visiting a health care facility for ultrasonography or laboratory testing. In rural states such as New Mexico, many patients travel hours for MAB, making two visits burdensome. Studies demonstrate feasibility, safety, and patient preference for remote follow-up. Materials and Methods: We evaluated whether MAB follow-up by telephone had noninferior loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) rates compared with ultrasonography or laboratory follow-up in a rural population. This was a retrospective chart review of University of New Mexico MAB LTFU rates after changing to telephone follow-up (home group, n = 136). Patients were propensity-matched in a 1:2 ratio to a historical cohort (health care group, n = 272) to eliminate significant differences. We defined LTFU as no contact within 50 days. We evaluated complications requiring intervention, possible ongoing pregnancy, completion of the home follow-up protocol (7- and 30-day calls, high-sensitivity urine pregnancy test [UPT]), follow-up by intended method (home or health care), and number of call attempts. Results: LTFU rates for the home group (n = 23, 17%) were noninferior to the health care group (n = 60, 22%, p = 0.24). Rates of complications requiring intervention (p = 0.83) and possible ongoing pregnancy (p = 0.72) among the home group were similar to the health care group. Ninety-seven (71%) home group patients completed the initial call, 79 (58%) completed the UPT, and 86 (69%) completed the 30-day call. Ninety-five (70%) home group patients followed up by intended method, comparable with the health care group (n = 199, 73%, p = 0.56). Staff made a median of 3 (interquartile range: 2-4) calls per home group patient. Conclusions: Remote MAB LTFU rates were noninferior to in-person LTFU rates.",0
Treatment Preferences in Young Adults with Moderate to Severe Psoriasis: A Qualitative Study from the Nordic Countries.,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to explore treatment preferences and identify patient characteristics in young bio-naive adults with moderate to severe psoriasis in the Nordic countries (Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Denmark). METHODS: Patients were 18-45 years old and bio-naive but referred for biologic treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. Patients were included at eight Nordic dermatology clinics. Patients with significant comorbidity or psoriatic arthritis were excluded. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) were assessed along with basic patient information. A semistructured interview guide was used in individual qualitative interviews, asking patients about their treatment preferences and reasons, disease journey, and disease management. The interviews were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Twenty-four patients sufficed to reach saturation in this qualitative study. RESULTS: The patient sample characteristics represented a qualitative variation in age, sex, symptoms, duration of disease, and country. We included a total of 12 male and 12 female patients. The mean age was 34 years (range 18-45 years), the mean age at diagnosis was 20 years (range 6-34 years), the mean ± standard deviation (SD) time since diagnosis was 13 ± 8 years, PASI was 9.5 ± 4.7, and DLQI was 15.2 ± 6.4. Interviews suggested that both the burden of disease as well as the burden of treatment influenced patient preferences regarding treatment attributes, hence getting alleviation from symptoms did not alone influence patient preferences. Time, effort, and inconvenience related to psoriasis treatments also influenced patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: This first in-depth, qualitative study in young bio-naive adults with psoriasis suggests that patient preferences are focusing not only on symptom relief but also on alleviating the burden of psoriasis treatment. Understanding the reasons for patient preferences and the perspectives of young adults is needed to guide individual shared decision-making in psoriasis management.",1
Early safety and efficacy comparison of endoscopic bariatric interventions.,"BACKGROUND: Intragastric balloon (IGB) placement and endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) are the 2 primary endoscopic bariatric therapies currently performed in the United States. Procedural selection is often based primarily on patient preference. There is a paucity of comparative data between these interventions. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to compare the short-term safety and efficacy of IGB to ESG in the largest, direct comparative analysis to date. SETTING: Accredited bariatric centers across the United States and Canada. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent IGB or ESG from 2016 to 2020 from the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program database. IGB patients were propensity matched (1:1) to ESG patients. We compared readmissions, reinterventions, serious adverse events (SAE), weight loss, procedure time, and length of stay between the 2 interventions. All outcomes were measured within 30 days of the initial procedure. RESULTS: A total of 1998 pairs of patients who underwent IGB and ESG were propensity matched with no difference in baseline characteristics. Patients who underwent ESG had more readmissions within 30 days. Patients who underwent IGB had more outpatient treatments for dehydration and re-interventions, with 3.7% of patients undergoing early balloon removal less than 30 days from implantation. Both procedures had similarly low rates of SAE (P > .05). ESG led to greater total body weight loss at 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: ESG and IGB are both safe procedures with comparably low rates of SAE. Higher rates of dehydration and re-interventions after IGB suggest that ESG is perhaps better tolerated.",0
Comparison of a validated decision-support tool to a standard of care triage system for knee osteoarthritis assessment: a proof-of-concept study.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) in northwestern Ontario are referred by their primary care provider (PCP) to a centralized assessment clinic for evaluation by an advanced practice physiotherapist (APP) to determine if they will require surgical management. However, many patients are found to not require surgical management, resulting in delays for patients who do. A decision-support tool was developed to address this issue and to guide treatment options by determining the need for surgical or nonsurgical approaches. METHODS: We used a proof-of-concept method to assess the use of the decision-support tool in northwestern Ontario. Data from 100 consecutive patients assessed for knee OA management were collected from the Thunder Bay centralized assessment clinic. Two levels of agreement analyses (calculated using Cohen κ statistic) were performed, between the APP assessment decision (surgical or non-surgical) and the decision-support tool recommendation, and between the surgeon's decision (surgical or non-surgical) and the decision-support tool recommendation. RESULTS: We found a near-perfect agreement (κ = 0.870, n = 65) between the APP decision and the decision-support tool recommendation, when controlled for patient preference. There was a substantial level of agreement (κ = 0.618, n = 72) between the decision-support tool recommendation and the surgeon's decision. CONCLUSION: The decision-support tool recommendation showed considerable agreement with the decisions of the APP and surgeon indicating that it could be a valuable tool to guide PCPs caring for patients with knee OA. The applicability of a decision-support tool in northwestern Ontario displayed promising results, but further research is needed to examine the feasibility in a primary care setting.",0
Gene Therapy for Hemophilia A: A Mixed Methods Study of Patient Preferences and Shared Decision-Making.,"PURPOSE: As gene therapies for hemophilia are incorporated into clinical practice, shared decision-making (SDM) is recommended for implementation. SDM tools may facilitate informed decision-making for gene therapy and other novel therapies. OBJECTIVE: To inform the development of SDM tools for hemophilia gene therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Men with severe hemophilia were recruited from the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) Community Voices in Research (CVR). Semi-structured interviews were completed, and the interviews were transcribed verbatim for quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-five men with severe hemophilia A participated. All participants reported treatment with prophylaxis, nine (36%) on continuous prophylaxis with clotting factor, one (4%) on intermittent prophylaxis with clotting factor, and 15 (60%) on continuous prophylaxis with emicizumab. Ten (40%) indicated that they are excited about gene therapy, 12 (48%) indicated that they are hopeful about gene therapy, one (4%) indicated that they are worried or scared about gene therapy, and one (4%) indicated that they do not have strong feelings about gene therapy. Participants reported engaging Hemophilia Treatment Center, family, and the hemophilia community in their decision-making process. The most reported information needs are efficacy, safety, cost/insurance, mechanism of action, and follow-up. In addition, key information themes that emerged were patient testimonials, hard data and statistics, and comparison to other products. Twenty-two (88%) indicated that a SDM tool would be useful when discussing gene therapy with their hemophilia team. Two indicated that they do their own research, and the tool would not add anything. One needed more information to provide an answer. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the utility of a SDM tool for hemophilia gene therapy and key information needs. Data including comparison to other treatments should be provided along with patient testimonials in a transparent format. Patients will engage the Hemophilia Treatment Center, family, and community members in the decision-making process.",0
Elevated end-of-life spending: A new measure of potentially wasteful health care spending at the end of life.,"OBJECTIVE: To construct a new measure of end-of-life (EoL) spending-the elevated EoL spending-and examine its associations with measures of quality of care and patient and physician preferences in comparison with the commonly used total Medicare EoL spending measures. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING: Medicare claims data for a 20% random sample of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients, from the health care quality data for 2015-2016, from the Hospital Compare and the Medicare Geographic Variation public use file, and survey data about patient and physician preferences. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed the elevated EoL spending measure as the differential monthly spending between decedents and survivors with the same one-year mortality risk, where the risk was predicted using machine learning models. We then examined the associations of the hospital referral region (HRR)-level elevated EoL spending with various health care quality measures and with the survey-elicited patient and provider preferences. We also examined analogous associations for monthly total EoL spending on decedents. DATA EXTRACTION METHODS: Medicare FFS patients who were continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A & B in 2015 and were alive as of January 1, 2016. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found a large variation in the elevated EoL spending across HRRs in the United States. There was no evidence of an association between HRR-level elevated EoL spending and established health care quality measures, including those specific to EoL care, whereas total EoL spending was positively associated with certain quality of care measures. We also found no evidence that elevated EoL spending was associated with patient preferences for EoL care. However, elevated EoL spending was positively and significantly associated with physician preferences for treatment intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that elevated EoL spending captures different resource use from conventional measures of EoL spending and may be more valuable in identifying potentially wasteful spending.",0
"Association of Race, Ethnicity, Insurance, and Language and Rate of Breast-Conserving Therapy Among Women With Nonmetastatic Breast Cancer at an Urban, Safety-Net Hospital.","INTRODUCTION: Breast-conserving therapy (BCT), specifically breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and adjuvant radiation, provides an equivalent alternative to mastectomy for eligible patients. However, previous studies have shown that BCT is underused in the United States, particularly among marginalized demographic groups. In this study, we examine the association between race, ethnicity, insurance, and language and rate of BCS among patients treated at an academic, safety-net hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 520 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer diagnosed and treated at an academic, safety-net hospital (2009-2014). We assessed eligibility for BCT and then differences in the rate of BCT among eligible patients by race, ethnicity, insurance, and language. Reasons for not undergoing BCT were documented. RESULTS: Median age was 60 y; 55.9% were non-White, 31.9% were non-English-speaking, 15.6% were Hispanic, and 47.4% were Medicaid/uninsured. Three hundred seventy one (86.3%) underwent BCS; within this group, 324 (87.3%) completed adjuvant radiation. Among patients undergoing mastectomy, 30 patients (36.7%) were eligible for BCT; within this group, reasons for mastectomy included patient preference (n = 28) and to avoid possible re-excision or adjuvant radiation in patients with significant comorbidities (n = 2). Eligibility for BCT varied by ethnicity (Hispanic [100%], Non-Hispanic [92%], P = 0.02), but not race, language, or insurance. Among eligible patients, rate of BCS varied by age (<50 y [84.9%], ≥50 y [92.9%], P = 0.01) and ethnicity (Hispanic [98.5%], Non-Hispanic [91.3%], P = 0.04), but not race, language, or insurance. CONCLUSIONS: At our safety-net hospital, the rate of BCS among eligible patients did not vary by race, language, or insurance. Excluding two highly comorbid patients, all patients who underwent mastectomy despite being eligible for BCT were counseled regarding BCS and expressed a preference for mastectomy. Further research is needed to understand the value of BCT in the treatment of breast cancer, to ensure informed decision-making, address potential misconceptions regarding BCT, and advance equitable care for all patients.",0
"Access to device-aided therapies in advanced Parkinson's disease: navigating clinician biases, patient preference, and prognostic uncertainty.","Device-aided therapies (DAT), which include deep brain stimulation and pump-based continuous dopaminergic stimulation with either levodopa or apomorphine, are among the major advances in the clinical management of Parkinson's disease (PD). Although DAT are being increasingly offered earlier in the disease course, their classical indication remains advanced PD. Theoretically, every patient should be offered transition to DAT when faced with refractory motor and nonmotor fluctuations and functional decline. Worldwide clinical reality is far from these ideal, and, therefore, question the ""real-world"" equal opportunity of access to DAT for PD patients with advanced PD-even within a single health care system. Differences in access to care, referral pattern (timing and frequency), as well as physician biases (unconscious/implicit or conscious/explicit bias), and patients' preferences or health-seeking behaviour are to be considered. Compared to DBS, little information is available concerning infusion therapies, as well as neurologists' and patients' attitudes towards them. This viewpoint aims to be thought-provoking and to assist clinicians in moving through the process of DAT selection, by including in their decision algorithm their own biases, patient perspective, ethical concerns as well as the current unknowns surrounding PD prognosis and DAT-related long-term side effects for a given patient.",0
Patient Preferences for Adjuvant Treatment in Muscle-Invasive Urothelial Carcinoma: A Multi-Country Discrete Choice Experiment.,"PURPOSE: The evolving treatment landscape in muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma creates challenges for clinicians and patients in selecting the most appropriate therapy. Here, we aimed to understand adjuvant treatment preferences among patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma who underwent radical resection, including tradeoffs between efficacy outcomes and toxicity risks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional study utilizing a discrete choice experiment was conducted across the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Germany via a web-based survey. Patients ≥18 years of age who self-reported as having been diagnosed with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma were included. Patients indicated their preferences between hypothetical treatment profiles varying in eight attributes relating to efficacy, regimen, and side effects. Preference weights were estimated using hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression; relative attribute importance estimates were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, 207 patients were included (age ≥56 years, 65.7%; male, 54.1%). Patients chose adjuvant treatment 91.2% of the time vs no treatment. Prolonging overall survival from 25 to 78 months was most important, followed by reducing serious side effect risks. Increasing disease-free survival from 12 to 24 months was more important than decreasing risks of fatigue from 54% to 15% and nausea from 53% to 7%. Treatment with the shortest dosing regimen was more important for patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs patients who did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy; prolonging overall survival was more important than reducing the risk of a serious side effect in non-US patients; the opposite was found in the United States. CONCLUSION: Patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma who underwent radical resection preferred adjuvant treatment over no treatment regardless of side effects. Patients prioritized overall survival improvements followed by a reduced side effect profile.",1
Factors Influencing Primary Care Practitioners' Cancer Screening Recommendations for Older Adults: a Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Primary care practitioners (PCPs) play a key role in cancer screening decisions for older adults (≥ 65 years), but recommendations vary by cancer type and jurisdiction. PURPOSE: To examine the factors influencing PCPs' recommendations for breast, cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer screening for older adults. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Pre-Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL, searched from 1 January 2000 to July 2021, and citation searching in July 2022. STUDY SELECTION: Assessed factors influencing PCPs' breast, prostate, colorectal, or cervical cancer screening decisions for older adults' (defined either as ≥ 65 years or < 10-year life expectancy). DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently conducted data extraction and quality appraisal. Decisions were crosschecked and discussed where necessary. DATA SYNTHESIS: From 1926 records, 30 studies met inclusion criteria. Twenty were quantitative, nine were qualitative, and one used a mixed method design. Twenty-nine were conducted in the USA, and one in the UK. Factors were synthesized into six categories: patient demographic characteristics, patient health characteristics, patient and clinician psycho-social factors, clinician characteristics, and health system factors. Patient preference was most reported as influential across both quantitative and qualitative studies. Age, health status, and life expectancy were also commonly influential, but PCPs held nuanced views about life expectancy. Weighing benefits/harms was also commonly reported with variation across cancer screening types. Other factors included patient screening history, clinician attitudes/personal experiences, patient/provider relationship, guidelines, reminders, and time. LIMITATIONS: We could not conduct a meta-analysis due to variability in study designs and measurement. The vast majority of included studies were conducted in the USA. CONCLUSIONS: Although PCPs play a role in individualizing cancer screening for older adults, multi-level interventions are needed to improve these decisions. Decision support should continue to be developed and implemented to support informed choice for older adults and assist PCPs to consistently provide evidence-based recommendations.

Impact of patient choice and hospital competition on patient outcomes after rectal cancer surgery: A national population-based study.,"BACKGROUND: The objective of the current national cohort study was to analyze the correlation between choice and competition on outcomes after cancer surgery in rectal cancer. METHODS: The analysis included all men who underwent rectal cancer surgery in the English National Health Service between March 2015 and April 2019 (n = 13,996). Multilevel logistic regression was used to assess the effect of a rectal cancer surgery center being located in a competitive environment (based on the number of centers within a threshold distance) and being a successful competitor (based on the ability to attract patients from other hospitals) on eight patient-level outcomes: 30- and 90-day emergency readmissions, 30-day re-operation rates, 90-day postoperative mortality, length of stay >14 days, circumferential resection margin status, rates of primary procedure with a permanent stoma, and rates of persistent stoma 18 months after anterior resection. RESULTS: With adjustment for patient characteristics, patients who underwent surgery in centers located in a stronger competitive environment were less likely to have an abdominoperineal excision or a Hartman's procedure (odds ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.97, p = .04). Additionally, individuals who received treatment at hospitals that were successful competitors had a lower risk of a 90-day readmission following rectal cancer surgery (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.97, p = .03) and were less likely to have a persistent stoma at 18 months after anterior resection (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.93, p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals located in areas of high competition are associated with better patient outcomes and improved processes of care for rectal cancer surgery.",0
Fix or Replace? Patient Preferences for the Treatment of Geriatric Lower Extremity Fractures: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: When considering treatment options for geriatric patients with lower extremity fractures, little is known about which outcomes are prioritized by patients. This study aimed to determine the patient preferences for outcomes after a geriatric lower extremity fracture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We administered a discrete choice experiment survey to 150 patients who were at least 60 years of age and treated for a lower extremity fracture at a Level I trauma center. The discrete choice experiment presented study participants with 8 sets of hypothetical outcome comparisons, including joint preservation (yes or no), risk of reoperation at 6 months and 24 months, postoperative weightbearing status, disposition, and function as measured by return to baseline walking distance. We estimated the relative importance of these potential outcomes using multinomial logit modeling. RESULTS: The strongest patient preference was for maintained function after treatment (59%, P < .001), followed by reoperation within 6 months (12%, P < .001). Although patients generally favored joint preservation, patients were willing to change their preference in favor of joint replacement if it increased function (walking distance) by 13% (SE, 66%). Reducing the short-term reoperation risk (12%, P < .001) was more important to patients than reducing long-term reoperation risk (4%, P = .33). Disposition and weightbearing status were lesser priorities to patients (9%, P < .001 and 7%, P < .001, respectively). DISCUSSION: After a lower extremity fracture, geriatric patients prioritized maintained walking function. Avoiding short-term reoperation was more important than avoiding long-term reoperation. Joint preservation through fracture fixation was the preferred treatment of geriatric patients unless arthroplasty or arthrodesis provides a meaningful functional benefit. Hospital disposition and postoperative weightbearing status were less important to patients than the other included outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric patients strongly prioritize function over other outcomes after a lower extremity fracture.",1
"Cardio4Health Study, a Cardiac Telerehabilitation Pilot Program Aimed at Patients After an Ischemic Event: Cross-sectional Study.","BACKGROUND: Center-based cardiac rehabilitation programs (CRPs) reduce morbidity and mortality after an ischemic cardiac event; however, they are widely underused. Home-based CRP has emerged as an alternative to improve patient adherence; however, its safety and efficacy remain unclear, especially for older patients and female patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a holistic home-based CRP for patients with ischemic heart disease and evaluate its safety and impact on functional capacity, adherence to a healthy lifestyle, and quality of life. METHODS: The 8-week home-based CRP included patients of both sexes, with no age limit, who had overcome an acute myocardial infarction in the previous 3 months, had a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≥40%, and had access to a tablet or mobile device. The CRP was developed using a dedicated platform designed explicitly for this purpose and included 3 weekly exercise sessions combining tailored aerobic and strength training and 2 weekly educational session focused on lifestyle habits, therapeutic adherence, and patient empowerment. RESULTS: We initially included 62 patients, of whom 1 was excluded for presenting with ventricular arrhythmias during the initial stress test, 5 were excluded because of incompatibility, and 6 dropped out because of a technological barrier. Ultimately, 50 patients completed the program: 85% (42/50) were male, with a mean age of 58.9 (SD 10.3) years, a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 52.1% (SD 6.72%), and 25 (50%) New York Heart Association functional class I and 25 (50%) New York Heart Association II-III. The CRP significantly improved functional capacity (+1.6 metabolic equivalent tasks), muscle strength (arm curl test +15.5% and sit-to-stand test +19.7%), weekly training volume (+803 metabolic equivalent tasks), adherence to the Mediterranean diet, emotional state (anxiety), and quality of life. No major complications occurred, and adherence was excellent (>80%) in both the exercise and educational sessions. In the subgroup analysis, CRP showed equivalent beneficial effects irrespective of sex and age. In addition, patient preferences for CRP approaches were equally distributed, with one-third (14/50, 29%) of the patients preferring a face-to-face CRP, one-third (17/50, 34%) preferring a telematic CRP, and one-third (18/50, 37%) preferring a hybrid approach. Regarding CRP duration, 63% (31/50) of the patients considered it adequate, whereas the remaining 37% (19/50) preferred a longer program. CONCLUSIONS: A holistic telematic CRP dedicated to patients after an ischemic cardiac event, irrespective of sex and age, is safe and, in our population, has achieved positive results in improving maximal aerobic capacity, weekly training volume, muscle strength, quality of life, compliance with diet, and anxiety symptoms. The preference for a center- or home-based CRP approach is diverse among the study population, emphasizing the need for a tailored CRP to improve adherence and completion rates.",0
"Treatment preferences of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France, and Spain: results from a discrete choice experiment.","INTRODUCTION: Newer treatment options for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) with efficacy and safety profiles that differ from traditional therapies have facilitated personalized management strategies to optimize patient outcomes. In the context of such personalized management, understanding how treatment characteristics influence patients' preferences is essential. This study assessed patients' preferences for RRMM treatment attributes and determined trade-offs between potential benefits, administration procedures, and adverse effects. METHODS: Patients' preferences were evaluated using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Patients with RRMM who reported failing two lines of anti-myeloma treatment (immunomodulatory agent and a proteasome inhibitor [PI]) or ≥ 3 lines (including ≥1 PI, immunomodulatory agent, or anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody), were recruited across the US, UK, Italy, Germany, France, and Spain. DCE attributes and levels were identified using a targeted literature review, a review of clinical data for relevant RRMM treatments, qualitative patient interviews, and input from clinical and myeloma patient experts. The DCE was administered within an online survey from February-June 2022. Preference data were analyzed using an error-component logit model and willingness to make trade-offs for potential benefits, and relative attribute importance scores were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, 296 patients from the US (n = 100), UK (n = 49), Italy (n = 45), Germany (n = 43), France (n = 39), and Spain (n = 20) participated in the DCE. Mean (standard deviation) age was 63.8 (8.0) years, 84% had a caregiver, and patients had a median of 3 (range: 2-8) prior lines of therapy. Efficacy attributes most influenced patients' preferences, with increasing overall response rate (25-85%) and overall survival (6 months to 2 years) contributing to ~50% of treatment decision-making. Administration procedures were also considered important to patients. Avoiding individual side effects was considered relatively less important, with patients willing to tolerate increases in side effects for gains in efficacy. Patient characteristics such as rate of disease progression, sociodemographics, or clinical characteristics also influenced treatment preferences. CONCLUSION: Patients with RRMM were willing to tolerate increased risk of side effects for higher efficacy. Preferences and risk tolerance varied between patients, with preference patterns differing by certain patient characteristics. This highlights the importance of shared decision-making for optimal treatment selection and patient outcomes.",1
Advances in Human-Centered Care to Address Contemporary Unmet Needs in Chronic Dialysis.,"Advances in the treatment of kidney failure with chronic dialysis have stagnated over the past three decades, with over 50% of patients still managed by conventional in-hospital haemodialysis. In parallel, the demands of chronic dialysis medical care have changed and evolved due to a growing population that has higher frailty and multimorbidity. Thus, the gap between the needs of kidney failure patients and the healthcare capability to provide effective overall management has widened. To address this problem, healthcare policy has increasingly aligned towards a human-centred approach. The paradigm shift of human-centred approach places patients at the forefront of decision-making processes, ensuring that specific needs are understood and prioritised. Integration of human-centred approaches with patient care has been shown to improve satisfaction and quality of life. The aim of this narrative is to evaluate the current clinical challenges for managing kidney failure for dialysis providers; summarise current experiences and unmet needs of chronic dialysis patients; and finally emphasise how human-centred care has advanced chronic dialysis care. Specific incremental advances include implementation of renal supportive care; home-assisted dialysis; hybrid dialysis; refinements to dialysis methods; whereas emerging advances include portable and wearable dialysis devices and the potential for the integration of artificial intelligence in clinical practice.",0
Real-World Experience of People with Hemophilia A Receiving Turoctocog Alfa Pegol (N8-GP): Results from a Patient Experience Survey.,"PURPOSE: Turoctocog alfa pegol (N8-GP) is an extended half-life recombinant factor VIII molecule used for the treatment of hemophilia A (HA). The purpose of this study was to investigate real-world experiences of patients with HA treated with N8-GP. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 25-minute online survey was completed by adults (≥18 years) and caregivers of adolescents (12-16 years) with HA receiving N8-GP across six countries (Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, UK and US). Patients were recruited using a multichannel approach through recruitment panels, referrals from healthcare professionals and patient associations. The survey comprised a questionnaire with metrics including satisfaction and preferences for N8-GP, quality of life (QoL) and long-term impact. RESULTS: A total of 62 participants (98% male [n=61], mean age 29 years) comprising 46 patients and 16 caregivers completed the survey. Patients (60% non-severe [n=37] and 40% severe [25]) were on N8-GP for a mean period of 1.4 years. Patients expressed satisfaction (95% vs 42%, p<0.001) and preference (91% vs 9%, p<0.001) for N8-GP vs their previous treatments. Most patients with severe HA (87%, p=0.038) and patients on prophylaxis (84%, p<0.001) stated lower frequency of injections as their main reason for satisfaction, while improved QoL drove satisfaction for non-severe patients (81%, p=0.053). Overall, patients perceived that QoL score improved (74.8 vs 65.9, p=0.01) with N8-GP treatment compared with previous treatments. Flexibility to store at room temperature was one of the key convenience factors driving satisfaction. Patients believed that N8-GP can offer a long-term impact in areas such as ability to perform day-to-day activities (68%), independence to live like a person without hemophilia (63%), ability to travel (60%) with a feeling of optimism and hopefulness (82%). CONCLUSION: Lower frequency of injections, storage flexibility and improved QoL drove satisfaction and preference for N8-GP over previous treatments among patients with HA.",0
Considering patient perspectives in economic evaluations of health interventions.,"Current guidelines for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of health interventions commonly recommend the use of a payer and/or a societal perspective. This raises the concern that the resulting reimbursement decision may overlook the full spectrum of impacts and equity considerations. In this paper, we argue that a potential solution is to supplement a societal- or payer-perspective economic evaluation with an additional evaluation accounting for exclusively the patient perspective. We present five categories of health interventions for which a patient-perspective analysis may be informative including those (1) that cross the definitional boundary between drugs and non-drug technologies; (2) affect patient adherence to protocol; (3) represent revolutionary treatments for genetic disorders; (4) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio involving slightly less effective, but substantially less costly, than the current standard; and (5) have been previously approved for funding but now being targeted for potential delisting or disinvestment. Real-world examples are discussed in detail. Lived experience individuals were invited to provide vignettes. Discussions are provided regarding how to incorporate patient inputs to improve patient-centered decision-making.",0
Cancer patients' expectations of advance care planning: A typological content analysis of qualitative interviews.,"BACKGROUND: Advance care planning (ACP) can help to elicit cancer patients' preferences in a discussion process to promote person-centred medical decision-making. Expectations are known to be highly relevant determinants of decisional processes. So far, however, little is known about cancer patients' expectations of ACP that lead to acceptance or refusal of the programme. The presented study, therefore, aims to explore cancer patients' expectations of ACP. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposeful sample of 27 cancer patients consenting to or refusing a newly implemented ACP programme in a German university hospital. Data were analysed using typological content analysis. RESULTS: We identified five different expectation clusters in relation to ACP. Consenting participants held expectations about the impact of ACP that were either 'ego-centred' or 'family-centred'. Refusers had expectations based on ignorance and misinformation, or-if they had already completed an advance directive-expectations to avoid unpleasant redundancy, perceiving no additional benefit but a burden from ACP. Finally, refusers in particular expressed expectations of delegated responsibility at the end of life, including anticipation of proxy decision-making. CONCLUSION: Our study results suggest that expectation-modifying measures could be taken to positively influence cancer patients' expectations and thus the acceptance of ACP. In this respect, reducing ignorance and misguided expectations plays a decisive role. Especially in family constellations with expected delegation of responsibility and dependence at the end of life, it might be important to promote ACP as a family-intervention to improve family outcomes.",0
Acne characteristics in Latin American patients and the potential role of trifarotene.,"BACKGROUND: Individualization of treatment based on acne type and severity, location, disease burden, and patient preference is required to maximize efficacy, safety, and adherence to therapy. Latin American populations have unique attributes that must be considered as part of this process to improve clinical success and achieve patient goals. Acne is more common among patients with darker skin phototypes, in whom it is often associated with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring-the most important acne sequelae-potentially due to more frequent and more severe underlying inflammatory processes in this population. DISCUSSION: These data argue for an early and proactive approach to managing acne in these patients with agents that target the inflammatory processes that underlie acne and its sequelae. As a class, retinoids offer a spectrum of activity that may be useful in addressing the unique needs of Latin American populations. CONCLUSION: Trifarotene, a novel, selective retinoid, has been evaluated in relevant patient populations.",0

Patient and Public Acceptance of Digital Technologies in Health Care: Protocol for a Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Strokes pose a particular challenge to the health care system. Although stroke-related mortality has declined in recent decades, the absolute number of new strokes (incidence), stroke deaths, and survivors of stroke has increased. With the increasing need of neurorehabilitation and the decreasing number of professionals, innovations are needed to ensure adequate care. Digital technologies are increasingly used to meet patients' unfilled needs during their patient journey. Patients must adhere to unfamiliar digital technologies to engage in health interventions. Therefore, the acceptance of the benefits and burdens of digital technologies in health interventions is a key factor in implementing these innovations. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the development of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to weigh criteria that impact patient and public acceptance. Secondary study objectives are a benefit-burden assessment (estimation of the maximum acceptable burden of technical features and therapy-related characteristics for the patient or individual, eg, no human contact), overall comparison (assessment of the relative importance of attributes for comparing digital technologies), and adherence (identification of key attributes that influence patient adherence). The exploratory objectives include heterogeneity assessment and subgroup analysis. The methodological aims are to investigate the use of DCE. METHODS: To obtain information on the criteria impacting acceptance, a DCE will be conducted including 7 attributes based on formative qualitative research. Patients with stroke (experimental group) and the general population (control group) are surveyed. The final instrument includes 6 best-best choice tasks in partial design. The experimental design is a fractional-factorial efficient Bayesian design (D-error). A conditional logit regression model and mixed logistic regression models will be used for analysis. To consider the heterogeneity of subgroups, a latent class analysis and an analysis of heteroscedasticity will be performed. RESULTS: The literature review, qualitative preliminary study, survey development, and pretesting were completed. Data collection and analysis will be completed in the last quarter of 2023. CONCLUSIONS: Our results will inform decision makers about patients' and publics' acceptance of digital technologies used in innovative interventions. The patient preference information will improve decisions regarding the development, adoption, and pricing of innovative interventions. The behavioral changes in the choice of digital intervention alternatives are observable and can therefore be statistically analyzed. They can be translated into preferences, which define the value. This study will investigate the influences on the acceptance of digital interventions and thus support decisions and future research.

Preferences for Monitoring Comprehensive Heart Failure Care: A Latent Class Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To measure preference heterogeneity for monitoring systems among patients with a chronic heart failure. METHODS: A best-worst scaling experiment (BWS case 3) was conducted among patients with chronic heart failure to assess preferences for hypothetical monitoring care scenarios. These were characterized by the attributes mobility, risk of death, risk of hospitalization, type and frequency of monitoring, risk of medical device, and system-relevant complications. A latent class analysis (LCA) was used to analyze and interpret the data. In addition, a market simulator was used to examine which treatment configurations participants in the latent classes preferred. RESULTS: Data from 278 respondents were analyzed. The LCA identified four heterogeneous classes. For class 1, the most decisive factor was mobility with a longer distance covered being most important. Class 2 respondents directed their attention toward attribute ""monitoring,"" with a preferred monitoring frequency of nine times per year. The attribute risk of hospitalization was most important for respondents of class 3, closely followed by risk of death. For class 4, however, risk of death was most important. A market simulation showed that, even with high frequency of monitoring, most classes preferred therapy with high improvement in mobility, mortality, and hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Using LCA, variations in preferences among different groups of patients with chronic heart failure were examined. This allows treatment alternatives to be adapted to individual needs of patients and patient groups. The findings of the study enhance clinical and allocative decision-making while elevating the quality of clinical data interpretation.",1
Perceived guideline clarity impacts guideline-concordant care for breast cancer screening in women age 40-49.,"BACKGROUND: Canadian and US Task Forces recommend against routine mammography screening for women age 40-49 at average breast cancer risk as harms outweigh benefits. Both suggest individualized decisions based on the relative value women place on potential screening benefits and harms. Population-based data reveal variation in primary care professionals (PCPs) mammography rates in this age group after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, highlighting the need to explore PCP screening perspectives and how this informs clinical behaviours. Results from this study will inform interventions that can improve guideline concordant breast screening for this age group. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were performed with PCPs in Ontario, Canada. Interviews were structured using the theoretical domains framework (TDF) to explore determinants of breast cancer screening best-practice behaviours: (1) risk assessment; (2) discussion regarding benefits and harms; and (3) referral for screening. ANALYSIS: Interviews were transcribed and analyzed iteratively until saturation. Transcripts were coded deductively by behaviour and TDF domain. Data that did not fit within a TDF code were coded inductively. The research team met repeatedly to identify potential themes that influenced or were important consequences of the screening behaviours. The themes were tested against further data, disconfirming cases, and different PCP demographics. RESULTS: Eighteen physicians were interviewed. The theme of perceived guideline clarity (a lack of clarity on guideline-concordant practices) influenced all behaviours and moderated the extent to which the risk assessment and discussion occurred. Many were unaware of how risk-assessment factored into the guidelines and/or did not perceive that a shared-care discussion was guideline-concordant. Deferral to patient preference (screening referral without a complete discussion of benefits and harms) occurred when the PCPs had low knowledge regarding harms and/or if they experienced regret (TDF domain: emotion) resulting from prior clinical experiences. Older providers described patient's influence impacting their decisions and physicians trained outside Canada, practicing in higher-resourced areas, and female physicians described being influenced by beliefs about consequences of benefits of screening. CONCLUSION: Perceived guideline clarity is an important driver of physician behaviour. Improving guideline concordant care should start by clarifying the guideline itself. Thereafter, targeted strategies include building skills in identifying and overcoming emotional factors and communication skills important for evidence-based screening discussions.",0
Advance care planning-family carer psychological distress and involvement in decision making: the ACTION trial.,"OBJECTIVES: Facilitated advance care planning (ACP) helps family carers' to be aware of patient preferences. It can improve family carers' involvement in decision making and their overall experiences at the end of life, as well as, reduce psychological stress. We investigated the effects of the ACTION Respecting Choices (RC) ACP intervention on the family carers' involvement in decision making in the last 3 months of the patients' life and on the family carers' psychological distress after 3 months of bereavement. METHODS: Over six European countries, a sample of 162 bereaved family carers returned a bereavement questionnaire. Involvement in decision making was measured with a single item of the Views of Informal Carers-Evaluation of Services Short Form questionnaire. Psychological distress was measured with the Impact of Event Scale (IES). RESULTS: No significant effect was found on family carers involvement in decision making in the last 3 months of the patients' life (95% CI 0.449 to 4.097). However, the probability of involvement in decision making was slightly higher in the intervention arm of the study (89.6% vs 86.7%; OR=1.357). Overall, no statistical difference was found between intervention and control group regarding the IES (M=34.1 (1.7) vs 31.8 (1.5); (95% CI -2.2 to 6.8)). CONCLUSION: The ACTION RC ACP intervention showed no significant effect on family carers' involvement in decision making or on subsequent psychological distress. More research is needed about (1) how family carers can be actively involved in ACP-conversations and (2) how to prepare family carers on their role in decision making.

Bone grafting techniques and materials for implant dentistry.,"Bone quality, volume, height and width all play a pivotal role in dental implant stability, success and survival. A lack of adequate bone can be overcome with various bone grafting procedures. Dependent on many factors, including the amount of bone required, the site of implant placement, patient preferences and clinician factors; the type of bone grafting material and procedure undertaken can vary. Supplemental bone can be sourced from a variety of sources, including autogenous, allogenous and xenograft bone. Dependent on the source of the bone, it will have different properties in aiding bone formation, as well as being presented in different formulations, such as bone particles or bone blocks.The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of bone grafting indications, materials and types of bone grafting techniques that can be utilised to aid dental implant provision. It also discusses the properties needed to ensure optimal success of guided bone regeneration techniques.",0
Indefinite Anticoagulant Therapy for First Unprovoked Venous Thromboembolism : A Cost-Effectiveness Study.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines recommend indefinite anticoagulation for a first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE). OBJECTIVE: To estimate the benefit-harm tradeoffs of indefinite anticoagulation in patients with a first unprovoked VTE. DESIGN: Markov modeling study. DATA SOURCES: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses for the long-term risks and case-fatality rates of recurrent VTE and major bleeding. Published literature for costs, quality of life, and other clinical events. TARGET POPULATION: Patients with a first unprovoked VTE who have completed 3 to 6 months of initial anticoagulant treatment. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Canadian health care public payer. INTERVENTION: Indefinite anticoagulation with direct oral anticoagulants. OUTCOME MEASURES: Recurrent VTE events, major bleeding events, costs in 2022 Canadian dollars (CAD), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: When compared with discontinuing anticoagulation after initial treatment in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients aged 55 years, indefinite anticoagulation prevented 368 recurrent VTE events, which included 14 fatal pulmonary emboli, but induced an additional 114 major bleeding events, which included 30 intracranial hemorrhages and 11 deaths from bleeding. Indefinite anticoagulation cost CAD $16 014 more per person and did not increase QALYs (-0.075 per person). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Model results were most sensitive to the case-fatality rate of major bleeding and the annual risk for major bleeding during extended anticoagulation. LIMITATION: The model assumed that risks for recurrent VTE and major bleeding measured in clinical trials at 1 year remained constant during extended anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should use shared decision making to incorporate individual patient preferences and values when considering treatment duration for unprovoked VTE.

Patient preferences and decision-making when considering surgery for musculoskeletal disorders: A mixed methods systematic review.,"INTRODUCTION: The burden of Musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) is large. Surgery is an important management option but the factors that shape patients' surgical decisions are not well understood. As prior reviews have explored only single data types or conditions, a mixed methods appraisal across the musculoskeletal spectrum was undertaken. METHODS: A mixed-methods systematic, convergent segregated approach was used, with PubMed, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINHAL), Embase and PsycINFO searched to identify studies of adult patients' decisions about whether to undergo surgery. A narrative synthesis was conducted, with identified themes integrated across quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies. RESULTS: Forty-six studies were included (24 quantitative, 19 qualitative and three mixed methods), with four decision-making themes identified (symptoms, sociodemographic and health factors, information and perceptions). Decision-making involves a complex interaction of individual sociodemographic, health and symptom information, integrated with individual perceptions of candidacy and surgical expectations. While most studies investigated hip and knee surgery, across all included conditions, patients are more likely to favour surgery if symptoms and/or dysfunction are higher, and if perceptions of surgical candidacy and processes (outcomes, inconvenience, and risk) are favourable. Other factors including age, general health, race, financial context, professional and non-professional communication, and information sources also impact decision-making but exert a less consistent impact upon the propensity to prefer surgery. CONCLUSION: Patients are more likely to choose surgery for MSD when they have higher levels of symptoms or dysfunction and positive perceptions of surgical suitability and expectations. Other factors important to individuals, have a less consistent impact upon the propensity to prefer surgery. These findings have potential to aid the efficient referral of patients to orthopaedics. More research is needed to validate these findings across the spectrum of MSD.",1
Neck Rejuvenation.,"A common complaint of patients presenting for facial cosmetic evaluation is the appearance of aging in the neck. Specifically, vertical lines visible at the medial borders of the platysma muscles - known as platysmal bands - accumulation of fat in the submental area, and effacement of the cervicomental angle are frequently mentioned. Multiple options with varying degrees of invasiveness are available to address these concerns, such as neck lift with or without platysmaplasty, submental liposuction, deoxycholic acid injection, cryotherapy, botulinum toxin injection, and skin resurfacing, among others. Determining the appropriate treatment modality will depend on patient preference and goals, budget, general health, and underlying anatomy. Frequently, these procedures will be combined with other interventions, like face lifting and blepharoplasty, or dermal filler injections. Surgeons will often need to pair with allied healthcare personnel, such as injection nurses and aestheticians, in order to maximize patients' results and satisfaction.",0
Patient and researcher stakeholder preferences for use of electronic health record data: a qualitative study to guide the design and development of a platform to honor patient preferences.,"OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study aimed to understand patient and researcher perspectives regarding consent and data-sharing preferences for research and a patient-centered system to manage consent and data-sharing preferences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted focus groups with patient and researcher participants recruited from three academic health centers via snowball sampling. Discussions focused on perspectives on the use of electronic health record (EHR) data for research. Themes were identified through consensus coding, starting from an exploratory framework. RESULTS: We held two focus groups with patients (n = 12 patients) and two with researchers (n = 8 researchers). We identified two patient themes (1-2), one theme common to patients and researchers (3), and two researcher themes (4-5). Themes included (1) motivations for sharing EHR data, (2) perspectives on the importance of data-sharing transparency, (3) individual control of personal EHR data sharing, (4) how EHR data benefits research, and (5) challenges researchers face using EHR data. DISCUSSION: Patients expressed a tension between the benefits of their data being used in studies to benefit themselves/others and avoiding risk by limiting data access. Patients resolved this tension by acknowledging they would often share their data but wanted greater transparency on its use. Researchers expressed concern about incorporating bias into datasets if patients opted out. CONCLUSIONS: A research consent and data-sharing platform must consider two competing goals: empowering patients to have more control over their data and maintaining the integrity of secondary data sources. Health systems and researchers should increase trust-building efforts with patients to engender trust in data access and use.",0
Patient and General Population Preferences Regarding the Benefits and Harms of Treatment for Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Patient preferences for treatment outcomes are important to guide decision-making in clinical practice, but little is known about the preferences of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient preferences regarding the attributed benefits and harms of systemic treatments for mHSPC and preference heterogeneity between individuals and specific subgroups. DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted an online discrete choice experiment (DCE) preference survey among 77 patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) and 311 men from the general population in Switzerland between November 2021 and August 2022. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We evaluated preferences and preference heterogeneity related to survival benefits and treatment-related adverse effects using mixed multinomial logit models and estimated the maximum survival time participants were willing to trade to avert specific adverse effects. We further assessed characteristics associated with different preference patterns via subgroup and latent class analyses. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Patients with mPC showed an overall stronger preference for survival benefits in comparison to men from the general population (p = 0.004), with substantial preference heterogeneity between individuals within the two samples (both p < 0.001). There was no evidence of differences in preferences for men aged 45-65 yr versus ≥65 yr, patients with mPC in different disease stages or with different adverse effect experiences, or general population participants with and without experiences with cancer. Latent class analyses suggested the presence of two groups strongly preferring either survival or the absence of adverse effects, with no specific characteristic clearly associated with belonging to either group. Potential biases due to participant selection, cognitive burden, and hypothetical choice scenarios may limit the study results. CONCLUSIONS: Given the relevant heterogeneity in participant preferences regarding the benefits and harms of treatment for mHSPC, patient preferences should be explicitly discussed during decision-making in clinical practice and reflected in clinical practice guidelines and regulatory assessment regarding treatment for mHSPC. PATIENT SUMMARY: We examined the preferences (values and perceptions) of patients and men from the general population regarding the benefits and harms of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. There were large differences between men in how they balanced the expected survival benefits and potential adverse effects. While some men strongly valued survival, others more strongly valued the absence of adverse effects. Therefore, it is important to discuss patient preferences in clinical practice.",1
Patients' Preference for Participation in Medical Decision-Making: Secondary Analysis of the BEDSIDE-OUTSIDE Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Patients may prefer different levels of involvement in decision-making regarding their medical care which may influence their medical knowledge. OBJECTIVE: We investigated associations of patients' decisional control preference (DCP) with their medical knowledge, ward round performance measures (e.g., duration, occurrence of sensitive topics), and perceived quality of care measures (e.g., trust in the healthcare team, satisfaction with hospital stay). DESIGN: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled multicenter trial conducted between 2017 and 2019 at 3 Swiss teaching hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients that were hospitalized for inpatient care. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was patients' subjective average knowledge of their medical care (rated on a visual analog scale from 0 to 100). We classified patients as active, collaborative, and passive according to the Control Preference Scale. Data collection was performed before, during, and after the ward round. KEY RESULTS: Among the 761 included patients, those with a passive DCP had a similar subjective average (mean ± SD) knowledge (81.3 ± 19.4 points) compared to patients with a collaborative DCP (78.7 ± 20.3 points) and active DCP (81.3 ± 21.5 points), p = 0.25. Regarding patients' trust in physicians and nurses, we found that patients with an active vs. passive DCP reported significantly less trust in physicians (adjusted difference, - 5.08 [95% CI, - 8.69 to - 1.48 points], p = 0.006) and in nurses (adjusted difference, - 3.41 [95% CI, - 6.51 to - 0.31 points], p = 0.031). Also, patients with an active vs. passive DCP were significantly less satisfied with their hospital stay (adjusted difference, - 7.17 [95% CI, - 11.01 to - 3.34 points], p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with active DCP have lower trust in the healthcare team and lower overall satisfaction despite similar perceived medical knowledge. The knowledge of a patient's DCP may help to individualize patient-centered care. A personalized approach may improve the patient-physician relationship and increase patients' satisfaction with medical care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03210987).",0
Immunotherapy in oncology and the kidneys: a clinical review of the evaluation and management of kidney immune-related adverse events.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are now widely used in the treatment of many cancers, and currently represent the standard of care for multiple malignancies. These agents enhance the T cell immune response to target cancer tissues, and have demonstrated considerable benefits for cancer outcomes. However, despite these improved outcomes, there are important kidney immune-related adverse events (iRAEs) associated with ICI. Acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis remains the most frequent kidney iRAE, however glomerular lesions and electrolytes disturbances are increasingly being recognized and reported. In this review, we summarize clinical features and identify risk factors for kidney iRAEs, and discuss the current understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms. We highlight the evidence basis for guideline-recommended management of ICI-related kidney injury as well as gaps in current knowledge. We advocate for judicious use of kidney biopsy to identify ICI-associated kidney injury, and early use of corticosteroid treatment where appropriate. Selected patients may also be candidates for re-challenge with ICI therapy after a kidney iRAE, in view of current data on recurrent rates of kidney injury. Risk of benefits of re-challenge must be considered on an individual considering patient preferences and prognosis. Lastly, we review current knowledge of ICI use in the setting of patients with end-stage kidney disease, including kidney transplant recipients and those receiving dialysis, which suggest that these patients should not be summarily excluded from the potential benefits of these cancer therapies.",0
"Understanding rural-urban differences in veterans' internet access, use and patient preferences for telemedicine.","BACKGROUND: The expansion of telemedicine (e.g., telephone or video) in the Veterans Health Administration (VA) raises concerns for health care disparities between rural and urban veterans. Factors impeding telemedicine use (e.g., broadband, digital literacy, age) disproportionally affect rural veterans. PURPOSE: To examine veteran-reported broadband access, internet use, familiarity with, and preferences for telemedicine stratified by residential rurality. METHODS: Three hundred fifty veterans with a VA primary care visit in March 2022 completed a 30-min computer-assisted telephone interview. The sampling design stratified veterans by residential rurality (i.e., rural or urban) and how primary care was delivered (i.e., in-person or by video). Counts and weighted percentages are reported. FINDINGS: After accounting for survey weights, 96.2% of respondents had in-home internet access and 89.5% reported functional connection speeds. However, rural- compared to urban-residing veterans were less likely to experience a telemedicine visit in the past year (74.1% vs. 85.2%; p = 0.02). When comparing telemedicine to in-person visits, rural versus urban-residing veterans rated them not as good (45.3% vs. 36.8%), just as good (51.1% vs. 53.1%), or better (3.5% vs. 10.0%) (p = 0.05). To make telemedicine visits easier, veterans, regardless of where they lived, recommended technology training (46.4%), help accessing the internet (26.1%), or provision of an internet-enabled device (25.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Though rural-residing veterans were less likely to experience a telemedicine visit, the same actionable facilitators to improve telemedicine access were reported regardless of residential rurality. Importantly, technology training was most often recommended. Policy makers, patient advocates, and other stakeholders should consider novel initiatives to provide training resources.",0
How do patients value features of biological medicine in rheumatoid arthritis? A discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to quantify the preference of the patients regarding biological DMARDs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients' preferences were assessed using a discrete choice experiment. Eighteen different surveys describing eight attributes were designed using experimental design methods. Each survey presented eight choice tasks with two options for patients to choose one. A conditional logit model was used to calculate relative importance and willingness to pay. Subgroup analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of the patients' characteristic on their preferences. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included in the study. All attributes had significant effects on the patients' choices. The most important feature was the ability to preserve physical function. The least important feature was the route of administration. Surprisingly, the out-of-pocket cost was one of the last priorities for respondents. According to the relative importance calculations, 80% of the patients' preferences can be obtained by clinical attributes. Based on subgroup analysis, the most important patient characteristic that affected their choices was the monthly out-of-pocket history. CONCLUSIONS: Different features of treatment had different effects on the patients' preferences. Quantification of the impact of each attribute not only revealed their relative importance but also determined the trade-off rate among them.",1
Oncoplastic Techniques and Tricks to Have in Your Toolbox.,"Oncoplastic breast reconstruction seeks to address partial mastectomy defects in the setting of breast-conserving surgery to achieve superior aesthetic outcomes with comparable oncologic safety compared with traditional breast conservation surgery. As such, oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery has grown in popularity in recent years. Several techniques have been used to displace the volume with the remaining breast tissue or replace it with local soft-tissue options, with decision-making guided by patient and tumor characteristics, additional treatment requirements, patient preference, and available tissue resources. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of considerations in oncoplastic breast reconstruction with a focus on techniques and tips to achieve optimal outcomes.",0
Mailing abortion pills does not delay care: A cohort study comparing mailed to in-person dispensing of abortion medications in the United States.,"OBJECTIVE: Given the substantial barriers to abortion access in the United States, many clinics now mail patients abortion medications. We examined whether dispensing the medications by mail prolonged time to medication use. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed data from no-test medication abortions with medication provided either by mail or in a clinic from 11 United States clinics from February 2020 to January 2021. We examined mean number of days from patients' first contact with the clinic to mifepristone ingestion, its two-component intervals (first contact to medication dispensing and dispensing to mifepristone ingestion), and pregnancy duration at mifepristone ingestion. We used Poisson regression to compare mean outcomes across three dispensing methods: in-person, mailed from the clinic, and mailed from a mail-order pharmacy. RESULTS: Among the 2600 records, patients took mifepristone on average at 49 days of gestation (95% CI, 47-51) and 7 days (95% CI, 4-10) after first contact. Mean time from first contact to mifepristone ingestion was 6 days when medications were dispensed in-person and 9 days when mailed (p = 0.38). While time from first contact to dispensing was similar across methods (6 days in-person, 5 days mailed, p = 0.77), more time elapsed from dispensing to mifepristone ingestion when medications were mailed (4 days from clinic, 5 days from mail-order pharmacy) versus dispensed in-person (0.3 days, p < 0.001). Time to mifepristone ingestion was shorter with higher pregnancy duration. Pregnancy duration at ingestion was similar across methods (48 days in-person, 50 days mailed). CONCLUSIONS: Mailing medications did not significantly prolong time from patients' first contact with the clinic to mifepristone ingestion or increase pregnancy duration at mifepristone ingestion. IMPLICATIONS: Abortion providers should offer a range of medication abortion dispensing options, prioritizing patient preference.",0
Study protocol for a cross-sectional online survey investigating patient preferences and experiences of waiting for elective cardiac surgery.,"INTRODUCTION: Being on a waiting list for elective (planned) cardiac surgery can be physically and psychologically challenging for patients. Research suggests that stress associated with waiting for surgery is dependent on different individual and contextual factors. However, most data on patients' experiences of waiting for surgery and preferences for waiting list management derives from non-cardiac clinical populations. The aim of the current study is to explore patients' experiences of being on a waiting list for elective cardiac surgery, and their views on how the waiting experience could be improved in the future. This work will inform the patient management strategy during the waiting period for surgery across the four major hospitals in London directly involved in this study, and potentially beyond by transferring learning to other services. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a mixed-methods study that will collect quantitative and qualitative data using a cross-sectional online survey. Patients who are on waiting lists for elective surgery across four major cardiac surgery departments in London hospitals, and are at least 18 years old, will be invited by their healthcare team via text message or letter to complete the survey. The target sample size of non-randomly selected participants will be 268. Bivariable and multivariable regression models will be used to assess associations between survey items measuring the impact of the cardiac condition on specific life domains (eg, daily activities, social and family relationships, hobbies, sexual life), anxiety and depression symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 and survey items evaluating experiences of health services. Data on experience and preferences for improvements to the waiting experience will be analysed with qualitative content analysis using an inductive approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was reviewed and granted ethical approval by the East of England-East Cambridge Research Ethics Committee. Findings from this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, a research website and social media and with an online event engaging patients, members of the public, healthcare professionals and other relevant stakeholders. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMB: NCT05996640.",0
Limited versus full sternotomy for aortic valve replacement.,"BACKGROUND: Aortic valve disease is a common condition easily treatable with cardiac surgery. This is conventionally performed by opening the sternum ('median sternotomy') and replacing the valve under cardiopulmonary bypass. Median sternotomy is well tolerated, but as less invasive options become available, the efficacy of limited incisions has been called into question. In particular, the effects of reducing the visibility and surgical access have raised safety concerns with regard to the placement of cannulae, venting of the heart, epicardial wire placement, and de-airing of the heart at the end of the procedure. These difficulties may increase operating times, affecting outcome. The benefits of smaller incisions are thought to include decreased pain; improved respiratory mechanics; reductions in wound infections, bleeding, and need for transfusion; shorter intensive care stay; better cosmesis; and a quicker return to normal activity. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2017, with seven new studies. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement via a limited sternotomy versus conventional aortic valve replacement via median sternotomy in people with aortic valve disease requiring surgical replacement. SEARCH METHODS: We performed searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase from inception to August 2021, with no language limitations. We also searched two clinical trials registries and manufacturers' websites. We reviewed references of primary studies to identify any further studies of relevance. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials comparing aortic valve replacement via a median sternotomy versus aortic valve replacement via a limited sternotomy. We excluded trials that performed other minimally invasive incisions such as mini-thoracotomies, port access, transapical, transfemoral or robotic procedures. Although some well-conducted prospective and retrospective case-control and cohort studies exist, these were not included in this review. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial papers to extract data, assess quality, and identify risk of bias. A third review author provided arbitration where required. We determined the certainty of evidence using the GRADE methodology and summarised results of patient-relevant outcomes in a summary of findings table. MAIN RESULTS: The review included 14 trials with 1395 participants. Most studies had at least two domains at high risk of bias. We analysed 14 outcomes investigating the effects of minimally invasive limited upper hemi-sternotomy on aortic valve replacement as compared to surgery performed via full median sternotomy. Upper hemi-sternotomy may have little to no effect on mortality versus full median sternotomy (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45 to 1.94; 10 studies, 985 participants; low-certainty evidence). Upper hemi-sternotomy for aortic valve replacement may increase cardiopulmonary bypass time slightly, although the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference (MD) 10.63 minutes, 95% CI 3.39 to 17.88; 10 studies, 1043 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and may increase aortic cross-clamp time slightly (MD 6.07 minutes, 95% CI 0.79 to 11.35; 12 studies, 1235 participants; very low-certainty evidence), although the evidence is very uncertain. Most studies had at least two domains at high risk of bias. Postoperative blood loss was probably lower in the upper hemi-sternotomy group (MD -153 mL, 95% CI -246 to -60; 8 studies, 767 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence suggested that there may be no change in pain scores by upper hemi-sternotomy (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.19, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.04; 5 studies, 649 participants). Upper hemi-sternotomy may result in little to no difference in quality of life (MD 0.03 higher, 95% CI 0 to 0.06 higher; 4 studies, 624 participants; low-certainty evidence). Two studies reporting index admission costs concluded that limited sternotomy may be more costly at index admission in the UK National Health Service (MD 1190 GBP more, 95% CI 420 GBP to 1970 GBP, 2 studies, 492 participants; low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence was of very low to moderate certainty. Sample sizes were small and underpowered to demonstrate differences in some outcomes. Clinical heterogeneity was also noted. Considering these limitations, there may be little to no effect on mortality. Differences in extracorporeal support times are uncertain, comparing upper hemi-sternotomy to full sternotomy for aortic valve replacement. Before widespread adoption of the minimally invasive approach can be recommended, there is a need for a well-designed and adequately powered prospective randomised controlled trial. Such a study would benefit from also performing a robust cost analysis. Growing patient preference for minimally invasive techniques merits thorough quality of life analyses to be included as end points, as well as quantitative measures of physiological reserve.",0
Fracture risk and assessment in adults with cancer.,"Individuals with cancer face unique risk factors for osteoporosis and fractures. Clinicians must consider the additive effects of cancer-specific factors, including treatment-induced bone loss, and premorbid fracture risk, utilizing FRAX score and bone mineral densitometry when available. Pharmacologic therapy should be offered as per cancer-specific guidelines, when available, or local general osteoporosis guidelines informed by clinical judgment and patient preferences. Our objective was to review and summarize the epidemiologic burden of osteoporotic fracture risk and fracture risk assessment in adults with cancer, and recommended treatment thresholds for cancer treatment-induced bone loss, with specific focus on breast, prostate, thyroid, gynecological, multiple myeloma, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. This narrative review was informed by PubMed searches to July 25, 2022, that combined terms for cancer, stem cell transplantation, fracture, bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular bone score, FRAX, Garvan nomogram or fracture risk calculator, QFracture, prediction, and risk factors. The literature informs that cancer can impact bone health in numerous ways, leading to both systemic and localized decreases in BMD. Many cancer treatments can have detrimental effects on bone health. In particular, hormone deprivation therapies for hormone-responsive cancers such as breast cancer and prostate cancer, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant for hematologic malignancies, adversely affect bone turnover, resulting in osteoporosis and fractures. Surgical treatments such as hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for gynecological cancers can also lead to deleterious effects on bone health. Radiation therapy is well documented to cause localized bone loss and fractures. Few studies have validated the use of fracture risk prediction tools in the cancer population. Guidelines on cancer-specific treatment thresholds are limited, and major knowledge gaps still exist in fracture risk and fracture risk assessment in patients with cancer. Despite the limitations of current knowledge on fracture risk assessment and treatment thresholds in patients with cancer, clinicians must consider the additive effects of bone damaging factors to which these patients are exposed and their premorbid fracture risk profile. Pharmacologic treatment should be offered as per cancer-specific guidelines when available, or per local general osteoporosis guidelines, in accordance with clinical judgment and patient preferences.",0
When should electronic medical records reminders for cancer screening stop?-Results from a national physician survey.,"BACKGROUND: Many older adults are screened for breast and colorectal cancers beyond guideline recommended thresholds. Electronic medical record (EMR) reminders are commonly used to prompt cancer screening. Behavioral economics theory suggests that changing the default settings for these reminders can be effective to reduce over-screening. We examined physician perspectives about acceptable thresholds for stopping EMR cancer screening reminders. METHODS: In a national survey of 1200 primary care physicians (PCP) and 600 gynecologists randomly selected from the AMA Masterfile, we asked physicians to choose whether EMR reminders for cancer screening should stop based on a list of criteria that included age, life expectancy, specific serious illnesses, and functional limitations. Physicians could choose multiple responses. PCPs were randomized to questions about breast or colorectal cancer screening. RESULTS: A total of 592 physicians participated (adjusted response rate 54.1%). 54.6% chose age and 71.8% chose life expectancy as criteria for stopping EMR reminders; only 30.6% chose functional limitations. Regarding age thresholds, 52.4% chose ages ≤75, 42.0% chose a threshold between 75 and 85, 5.6% would not stop reminders even at age 85. Regarding life expectancy thresholds, 32.0% chose ≥10 years, 53.1% chose a threshold between 5 and 9 years, 14.9% would not stop reminders even when life expectancy is <5 years. CONCLUSIONS: We found that many physicians would continue EMR reminders for cancer screening even in light of older age, limited life expectancy, and functional limitations. This may reflect reluctance to stop cancer screening and/or reluctance to stop EMR reminders so that physicians can retain control to decide for individual patients, for example, to assess patient preference and ability to tolerate treatment. There was consensus for stopping EMR reminders at ages 85+ and <5-year life expectancy. Interventions that seek to reduce over-screening by suppressing EMR reminders may be important for these groups but may have limited physician buy-in outside these thresholds.",0
Editorial Commentary: Suture Button Fixation for the Latarjet Procedure Is Superior to Screw Fixation.,"An increasing body of evidence suggests that suture button fixation is comparable with screw fixation in Latarjet and potentially associated with reduced graft resorption. Suture button fixation may facilitate performing the Latarjet procedure, particularly when done in an arthroscopic manner. The use of suture button fixation technique theoretically facilitates improved positioning of the graft on the glenoid, as it frees the surgeon from the potential of the soft-tissue envelope to impact positioning of the graft, which can occur with screw-based guides. The bone graft can be shuttled into an optimal position and then tensioned with relative ease in comparison with screw-based techniques. Suture button fixation results in lower complication rates compared with screw fixation; almost one third of the screw fixation complications are hardware-related, and screw fixation results in a high rate of hardware removal. Moreover, the arthroscopic Latarjet suture button literature is published by experienced surgeons. Arthroscopic Latarjet has a significant learning curve, reducing the translatability of studies that report superior findings with any one technique. The generalizability of results reminds us that evidence-based medicine should be practiced through the lens of not only patient preferences, but also through an honest appraisal of a surgeon's own ability.",0
Using discrete choice experiment to investigate patients' and parents' preferences for initiating ADHD medication.,"BACKGROUND: The decision to initiate medication is complex and is influenced by a variety of factors. There is limited information on the relative importance of factors that influence the initiation of ADHD medication. AIMS: To investigate the factors, and their relative importance, that influence the decision to initiate medication in adults, and parents of children, with ADHD. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was conducted using eight choice tasks made up of five attributes that described the outcomes of initiating medication. A mixed multinomial logit model was used to estimate preferences for medication. RESULTS: Respondents' overall preferences for initiating medication were negative (Mean (β)= -0.72705, p < 0.1), however, significant heterogeneity was noted in preferences (SD: 0.93604, p < 0.001). Side-effects were the most important factor for both adults (Relative importance (RI) = 40.39%) and parents (RI = 41.99%). Improvement in education had a greater weighting in adults' decision-making compared to parents (RI = 36.93% vs 30.47%) while improvement in aggressive (RI = 14.38% vs 11.84%) and social behaviour (RI = 12.59% vs 10.37%) was more important to parents. CONCLUSIONS: Important differences in preferences of patients and parents were identified, highlighting that the decision to initiate medication is influenced differently in different individuals and groups.",1
Perspectives of the Friedreich ataxia community on gene therapy clinical trials.,"Gene therapy is a potential treatment for Friedreich ataxia, with multiple programs on the horizon. The purpose of this study was to collect opinions about gene therapy from individuals 14 years or older with Friedreich ataxia or parents/caregivers of Friedreich ataxia patients who were diagnosed as children 17 or younger. Participants were asked to complete a survey after reading brief educational materials regarding gene therapy. Most of the patients captured in this survey have an early-onset (classical) presentation of the disease. Participants expressed urgency in participating in gene therapy clinical trials despite the associated risks. About half of the respondents believed that gene therapy would cease progression or minimize symptoms, whereas nearly one-fourth expected to be cured. The survey also revealed how participants perceive their symptom burden, because a substantial majority reported that balance/walking issues most interfere with their quality of life and would be the symptom they would prioritize treating. Although not statistically significant, more caregivers prioritized treating cardiomyopathy than patients. This study provides valuable information on priorities, beliefs, and expectations regarding gene therapy and serves to guide future gene therapy opinion studies and gene therapy trial design.",0

Co-Design of an Evidence-Based Practice Continuing Education Course for Canadian Naturopathic Doctors.,"Objectives: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is a clinical decision-making process combining the best available scientific evidence with clinician expertise and patient preference. While EBP has been associated with a range of benefits, it is recognized that EBP is used suboptimally by a range of health professionals, including naturopathic doctors (NDs). Canadian NDs have expressed a high level of interest in opportunities to improve their EBP skills; however, barriers exist, including those that apply broadly to health professionals, and those that are unique to the naturopathic profession. The objective of the present project was to co-design an EBP continuing education (CE) course tailored to the needs and preferences of Canadian NDs. Design: These needs were solicited through the use of focus groups. Groups were stratified based on participants' use of evidence at baseline. The focus groups asked NDs about their definition of EBP, and their interest in an EBP course, including preferred content, and method of delivery. The focus group discussions were transcribed, and thematic analysis was completed. Subjects: Twenty-two Canadian NDs participated. Results: Participants reported a high level of understanding of EBP, a high level of interest in participating in an EBP course and provided actionable recommendations about course content and delivery. Some of the themes that emerged were consistent across the groups while others differed by stratification. Conclusions: The findings of this project will inform the development and evaluation of a future CE course.",0
Turning It Over to God: African American Assisted Living Residents' End-of-Life Preferences and Advance Care Planning.,"OBJECTIVES: Assisted living (AL), a popular long-term care setting for older Americans, increasingly is a site for end-of-life care. Although most residents prefer AL to be their final home, relatively little is known about end-of-life preferences and advance care planning, especially among African American residents. Our research addresses this knowledge gap. METHODS: Informed by grounded theory, we present an analysis of qualitative data collected over 2 years in a 100-bed AL community catering to African American residents. Data consisted of field notes from participant observation conducted during 310 site visits and 818 observation hours, in-depth interviews with 25 residents, and a review of their AL records. RESULTS: Residents varied in their end-of-life preferences and advance care planning, but united in the belief that God was in control. We identified ""Turning it over to God"" as an explanatory framework for understanding how this group negotiated end-of-life preferences and advance care planning. Individual-level resident factors (e.g., age, pain, and function) and factors reflecting broader cultural and societal influences, including health literacy and care experiences, were influential. DISCUSSION: Contradictions arose from turning it over to God, including those between care preferences, planning, and anticipated or actual end-of-life outcomes.",0
Effect of switching from continuous to bilevel positive airway pressure on sleep quality in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: the prospective POP IN VAuto study.,"BACKGROUND: Issues with tolerability and side effects can decrease continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device usage and the benefits of therapy. Different positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy modes providing expiratory pressure relief or using a different pressure during inspiration vs. expiration (bilevel PAP) may alleviate some of these issues. This multicenter, prospective study evaluated the effects of switching from CPAP to bilevel PAP (VAuto mode) on respiratory parameters, device usage, side effects and patient-reported outcomes in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). METHODS: Eligible OSA patients had started CPAP ≥3 months previously, had good compliance (mean 6.1±2.0 h/night) and well-controlled OSA [residual apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 4.9±3.1/h] but had pressure tolerance issues or persistent side effects/discomfort. All were switched from CPAP to bilevel PAP (AirCurve 10 VAuto; ResMed). Effectiveness (residual AHI), sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, therapy-related side effects, and patient satisfaction/preference were assessed after 3 months and 1 year. RESULTS: Forty patients were analyzed (68% male, age 64±11 years, body mass index 30.7±5.8 kg/m(2)). At 3 months and 1 year after switching to bilevel PAP, median [interquartile range] residual AHI was 4/h [2-5.3] and 3.7/h [1.8-5], respectively, and device usage was 7.0 [4.9-7.5] and 6.4 [4.4-7.3] h/night, respectively. Device switch was associated with significant reductions from baseline in expiratory PAP {from 12 [11-13] to 8 [7-9] cmH(2)O at 3 months (P<0.001) and 9 [8-12] cmH(2)O at 1 year (P=0.005)}, 95(th) percentile pressure {from 14 [12-14] to 10 [9-11] and 10 [8-11] cmH2O; P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively} and leak {from 1 [0-6] to 0 [0-1] and 0 [0-2] L/min; P=0.049 and P=0.033, respectively}. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score decreased significantly from baseline to 3 and 6 months [7.2±4.0 to 5.0±3.2 (P=0.005) and 4.5±2.7 (P<0.001), respectively]. CPAP-related mouth dryness, choking sensation and aerophagia were significantly improved one year after switching to bilevel PAP. Bilevel PAP was preferred over CPAP by 90% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Switching to bilevel PAP had several benefits in patients struggling with CPAP, facilitating therapy acceptance and ongoing device usage.",0
The role of the foam formulation in improving psoriasis treatment acceptability: a real-life experience and a literature review.,"BACKGROUND: Topical therapies represent the first-line treatment for mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Among various topical options, the fixed-dose combination of calcipotriene (Cal) and betamethasone dipropionate (BD) foam (Enstilar®, LEO Pharma, Ballerup, Denmark) showed superior efficacy to Cal and BD monotherapy and ointment and gel formulations. In addition, the Cal/BD foam is the only topical treatment allowed for either reactive treatment of relapse or twice-weekly maintenance use. Since treatment acceptability is crucial to optimize adherence, this paper presents a case series from a multicenter experience using the Cal/BD foam, to further characterize the use of this therapeutic approach. In addition, a narrative review of studies evaluating the acceptability of the Cal/BD foam, even compared with other formulations, is provided. CASE SERIES: The case series involved adult patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis treated with the Cal/BD foam from October 2021 to June 2022. A clinical and dermoscopic evaluation of plaques was provided for all patients. Data from the clinical practice report complete clinical resolution of plaques in most patients after 4 weeks of active treatment with the Cal/BD foam, and the dermoscopic clearance after a maximum of 8 weeks. Full adherence to treatment was also reported. Literature evidence suggests that the Cal/BD foam is easy to apply and presents high cosmetic acceptance, rapid onset of action, high efficacy, optimal safety, and a high patient preference. The high satisfaction obtained with Cal/BD foam suggests that this formulation is better accepted than others. CONCLUSIONS: The Cal/BD foam represents a valuable approach for managing mild-to-moderate psoriasis, both in short and long-term treatment.",0
Racial disparities in the pharmacological treatment of insomnia: A time-to-event analysis using real-world data.,"OBJECTIVE: Examine the association between race and time to pharmacologic treatment of insomnia in a large multi-institutional cohort. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of electronic medical records from a regional health information exchange. Eligible patients included adults with at least one healthcare visit per year from 2010 to 2019, a new insomnia diagnosis code during the study period, and no prior insomnia diagnosis codes or medications. A Cox frailty model was used to examine the association between race and time to an insomnia medication after diagnosis. RESULTS: In total, 9557 patients were analyzed, 7773 (81.3%) of whom where White, 1294 (13.5%) Black, 238 (2.5%) Other, and 252 (2.6%) unknown race. About 6.2% of Black and 8% of Other race patients received an order for a Food and Drug Administration-approved insomnia medication after diagnosis compared with 13.5% of White patients. Black patients were significantly less likely to have an order for a Food and Drug Administration-approved insomnia medication at all time points (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] range: 0.37-0.73), and patients reporting Other race were less likely to have received an order at 2 (aHR 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.94), 3 (aHR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13-0.79), and 4 years (aHR 0.21, 95% CI 0.06-0.71) of follow-up. Similar results were observed in a sensitivity analysis including off-label medications. CONCLUSIONS: Patients belonging to racial minority groups are less likely to be prescribed an insomnia medication than White patients after accounting for sociodemographic and clinical factors. Further research is needed to determine the extent to which patient preferences and physician perceptions affect these prescribing patterns and investigate potential disparities in nonpharmacologic treatment.",0
The Experiences of Older Adults Living With Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Scoping Review.,"The prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease is rising in persons older than 65 years. Although there is extensive literature on inflammatory bowel disease in older adults from a disease-related outcome, epidemiological, and treatment perspective, the older adult perspective on inflammatory bowel disease-related care needs and experiences is not well represented. This scoping review examines the existing literature regarding the care experiences of older adults living with inflammatory bowel disease. A systematic search was conducted using 3 concepts: older adults, inflammatory bowel disease, and patient experience. Seven publications met the inclusion criteria. Reported data include study design and methods, sample characteristics, and findings relevant to the research question. Two themes were identified: preferences for interactions with healthcare personnel and peer support networks, and barriers to accessing care for inflammatory bowel disease needs. An overarching concept across all studies was the need and request for individualized, patient-centered care where patient preferences are considered. This review highlights the need for more research on the older adult age group to guide evidence-informed practice that meets their individual inflammatory bowel disease care needs.",0
How can patient preferences be used and communicated in the regulatory evaluation of medicinal products? Findings and recommendations from IMI PREFER and call to action.,"Objective: Patients have unique insights and are (in-)directly affected by each decision taken throughout the life cycle of medicinal products. Patient preference studies (PPS) assess what matters most to patients, how much, and what trade-offs patients are willing to make. IMI PREFER was a six-year European public-private partnership under the Innovative Medicines Initiative that developed recommendations on how to assess and use PPS in medical product decision-making, including in the regulatory evaluation of medicinal products. This paper aims to summarize findings and recommendations from IMI PREFER regarding i) PPS applications in regulatory evaluation, ii) when and how to consult with regulators on PPS, iii) how to reflect PPS in regulatory communication and iv) barriers and open questions for PPS in regulatory decision-making. Methods: PREFER performed six literature reviews, 143 interviews and eight focus group discussions with regulators, patient representatives, industry representatives, Health Technology Assessment bodies, payers, academics, and clincians between October 2016 and May 2022. Results: i) With respect to PPS applications, prior to the conduct of clinical trials of medicinal products, PPS could inform regulators' understanding of patients' unmet needs and relevant endpoints during horizon scanning activities and scientific advice. During the evaluation of a marketing authorization application, PPS could inform: a) the assessment of whether a product meets an unmet need, b) whether patient-relevant clinical trial endpoints and outcomes were studied, c) the understanding of patient-relevant effect sizes and acceptable trade-offs, and d) the identification of key (un-)favorable effects and uncertainties. ii) With respect to consulting with regulators on PPS, PPS researchers should ideally have early discussions with regulators (e.g., during scientific advice) on the PPS design and research questions. iii) Regarding external PPS communication, PPS could be reflected in the assessment report and product information (e.g., the European Public Assessment Report and the Summary of Product Characteristics). iv) Barriers relevant to the use of PPS in regulatory evaluation include a lack of PPS use cases and demonstrated impact on regulatory decision-making, and need for (financial) incentives, guidance and quality criteria for implementing PPS results in regulatory decision-making. Open questions concerning regulatory PPS use include: a) should a product independent broad approach to the design of PPS be taken and/or a product-specific one, b) who should optimally be financing, designing, conducting, and coordinating PPS, c) when (within and/or outside clinical trials) to perform PPS, and d) how can PPS use best be operationalized in regulatory decisions. Conclusion: PPS have high potential to inform regulators on key unmet needs, endpoints, benefits, and risks that matter most to patients and their acceptable trade-offs. Regulatory guidelines, templates and checklists, together with incentives are needed to foster structural and transparent PPS submission and evaluation in regulatory decision-making. More PPS case studies should be conducted and submitted for regulatory assessment to enable regulatory discussion and increase regulators' experience with PPS implementation and communication in regulatory evaluations.",1

When to Consider Coronary Revascularization for Stable Coronary Artery Disease.,"Revascularization is an effective adjunct to medical therapy for some patients with chronic coronary disease. Despite numerous randomized trials, there remains significant uncertainty regarding if and how to revascularize many patients. Coronary artery bypass grafting is a class I indication for patients with significant left main stenosis or multivessel disease with ejection fraction ≤ 35%. For other patients, clinicians must carefully consider the potential benefits of symptom improvement and reduction of future myocardial infarction or CV death against the risk and cost of revascularization. Although guidelines provide a framework for these decisions, each individual patient will have distinct coronary anatomy, clinical factors, and preferences.",0
Effective Use of Bromelain and Acetylcysteine (BromAc(®)) for Treatment of Perigastric Pseudomyxoma Peritonei: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare clinical condition of progressive peritoneal mucin accumulation. PMP has a reasonable survivability but with a notable risk of tumour recurrence. Standard treatment, including for tumour relapse, aims for a cure with complete cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. In the case of tumour recurrence, surgery becomes progressively complex, and some patients are not suitable for surgery either due to patient preference or morbidity and mortality risk. BromAc(®) is an emerging, novel mucolytic combination therapy composed of bromelain and acetylcysteine which can be administered intratumorally via radiologically guided drains. It represents a minimally invasive treatment for patients who have symptomatic tumour deposits but are not surgical candidates. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 64-year-old male with a background of appendiceal PMP who presented with a gastric outlet obstruction from a perigastric tumour deposit. This was managed with BromAc(®) administration, following which the patient's symptoms resolved. This corresponded with an 80% reduction in the tumour volume radiologically. CONCLUSION: BromAc(®) is an emerging minimally invasive treatment for PMP tumour deposits that may be considered as adjunctive or alternative treatment in patients who are not surgical candidates to reduce tumour burden and improve symptomatology and quality of life.",0
Impact of Opioid Dose Reductions on Patient-Reported Mental Health and Suicide-Related Behavior and Relationship to Patient Choice in Tapering Decisions.,"Mental health and suicide-related harms resulting from prescription opioid tapering are poorly documented and understood. Six health systems contributed opioid prescribing data from January 2016 to April 2020. Patients 18 to 70 years old with evidence of opioid tapering participated in semi-structured interviews. Individuals who experienced suicide attempts were oversampled. Family members of suicide decedents who had experienced opioid tapering were also interviewed. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. The study participants included 176 patients and 16 family members. Patients were 68% female, 80% White, and 15% Hispanic, mean age 58. All family members were female spouses of White, non-Hispanic male decedents. Among the subgroup (n = 60) who experienced a documented suicide attempt, reported experiencing suicidal ideation during tapering, or were family members of suicide decedents, 40% reported that opioid tapering exacerbated previously recognized mental health issues, and 25% reported that tapering triggered new-onset mental health concerns. Among participants with suicide behavior, 47% directly attributed it to opioid tapering. Common precipitants included increased pain, reduced life engagement, sleep problems, withdrawal, relationship dissolution, and negative consequences of opioid substitution with other substances for pain relief. Most respondents reporting suicide behavior felt that the decision to taper was made by the health care system or a clinician (67%) whereas patients not reporting suicide behavior were more likely to report it was their own decision (42%). This study describes patient-reported mental health deterioration or suicide behavior while tapering prescription opioids. Clinicians should screen for, monitor, and treat suicide behavior while assisting patients in tapering opioids. PERSPECTIVE: This work describes changes in patient-reported mental health and suicide behavior while tapering prescription opioids. Recommendations for improving care include mental health and suicide risk screening during and following opioid tapering.",0
"Effectiveness, reach, uptake, and feasibility of digital health interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.","BACKGROUND: Digital health interventions have shown promising results for the management of type 2 diabetes, but a comparison of the effectiveness and implementation of the different modes is not currently available. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of SMS, smartphone application, and website-based interventions on improving glycaemia in adults with type 2 diabetes and report on their reach, uptake, and feasibility. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo on May 25, 2022, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of digital health interventions in reducing glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) in adults with type 2 diabetes, published in English from Jan 1, 2009. Screening was carried out using Covidence, and data were extracted following Cochrane's guidelines. The primary endpoint assessed was the change in the mean (and 95% CI) plasma concentration of HbA(1c) at 3 months or more. Cochrane risk of bias 2 was used to assess risk of bias. Data on reach, uptake, and feasibility were summarised narratively and data on HbA(1c) reduction were synthesised in a meta-analysis. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria was used to evaluate the level of evidence. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021247845. FINDINGS: Of the 3236 records identified, 56 RCTs from 24 regions (n=11 486 participants), were included in the narrative synthesis, and 26 studies (n=4546 participants) in the meta-analysis. 20 studies used SMS as the primary mode of delivery of the digital health intervention, 25 used smartphone applications, and 11 implemented interventions via websites. Smartphone application interventions reported higher reach compared with SMS and website-based interventions, but website-based interventions reported higher uptake compared with SMS and smartphone application interventions. Effective interventions, in general, included people with greater severity of their condition at baseline (ie, higher HbA(1c)) and administration of a higher dose intensity of the intervention, such as more frequent use of smartphone applications. Overall, digital health intervention group participants had a -0·30 (95% CI -0·42 to -0·19) percentage point greater reduction in HbA(1c), compared with control group participants. The difference in HbA(1c) reduction between groups was statistically significant when interventions were delivered through smartphone applications (-0·42% [-0·63 to -0·20]) and via SMS (-0·37% [-0·57 to -0·17]), but not when delivered via websites (-0·09% [-0·64 to 0·46]). Due to the considerable heterogeneity between included studies, the level of evidence was moderate overall. INTERPRETATION: Smartphone application and SMS interventions, but not website-based interventions, were associated with better glycaemic control. However, the studies' heterogeneity should be recognised. Considering that both smartphone application and SMS interventions are effective for diabetes management, clinicians should consider factors such as reach, uptake, patient preference, and context of the intervention when deciding on the mode of delivery of the intervention. Nine in ten people worldwide own a feature phone and can receive SMS and four in five people have access to a smartphone, with numerous smartphone applications being available for diabetes management. Clinicians should familiarise themselves with this modality of programme delivery and encourage people with type 2 diabetes to use evidence-based applications for improving their self-management of diabetes. Future research needs to describe in detail the mediators and moderators of the effectiveness and implementation of SMS and smartphone application interventions, such as the optimal dose, frequency, timing, user interface, and communication mode to both further improve their effectiveness and to increase their reach, uptake, and feasibility.

Ultrasound-Guided Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block.,"Pain management is an integral part of providing care in the emergency setting. Lower extremity pain from hip fractures, burns, and other trauma is a common presenting complaint. Unfortunately, pain management can be difficult due to medication side effects, patient preferences, and other patient characteristics that can make intravenous analgesia less desirable. Opioid medications can be associated with respiratory depression, hypotension, mental status changes, and vomiting. NSAIDs can increase bleeding risk and exacerbate underlying gastrointestinal (GI) problems. Acetaminophen alone is often not sufficient for severe pain. Hip fractures, in particular, can cause considerable pain, and often occur in elderly adults with multiple comorbidities which make analgesia challenging. A fascia iliaca compartment block can provide superior analgesia with minimal side effects. It can be deployed in a relatively quick fashion after a small amount of training and can be executed with high success rates under ultrasound guidance. In a study by Monzon et al., patients who received a fascia iliaca compartment block for a hip fracture had significantly reduced pain levels. The pain was initially rated at an average of 8.5 on a 10 point scale but decreased to an average of 2.3 at 2 hours post-injection. In a study by Stevens et al., in Anesthesia Intensive Care, patients who underwent a fascia iliaca compartment block used significantly less morphine over the course of 24 hours than the control group which used morphine alone. An additional advantage is the duration of effect, which has been seen for 8 to 10 hours following a single shot block. Another randomized placebo-controlled trial showed that pain relief was superior at all time points measured in the fascia iliac compartment block group as compared with a group utilizing morphine only. In fact, median total morphine consumption in the compartment block group was 0 mg due to excellent analgesia after only a compartment block. Similar results were seen in a study by Lopez et al. for femoral shaft fractures. Emergency department-specific studies using ultrasound guidance have shown 76% mean reduction of pain score in patients with hip fracture at 120 minutes.",0
Persistent obstructive sleep apnoea in children: treatment options and management considerations.,"Unresolved obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) after an adenotonsillectomy, henceforth referred to as persistent OSA, is increasingly recognised in children (2-18 years). Although associated with obesity, underlying medical complexity, and craniofacial disorders, persistent OSA also occurs in otherwise healthy children. Inadequate treatment of persistent OSA can lead to long-term adverse health outcomes beyond childhood. Positive airway pressure, used as a one-size-fits-all primary management strategy for persistent childhood OSA, is highly efficacious but has unacceptably low adherence rates. A pressing need exists for a broader, more effective management approach for persistent OSA in children. In this Personal View, we discuss the use and the need for evaluation of current and novel therapeutics, the role of shared decision-making models that consider patient preferences, and the importance of considering the social determinants of health in research and clinical practice. A multipronged, comprehensive approach to persistent OSA might achieve better clinical outcomes in childhood and promote health equity for all children.",0
Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Statement: Clinical considerations for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus disease in infants.,"Respiratory syncytial virus is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract illness globally in children aged <5 years. Each year, approximately 58,000 hospitalizations in the United States are attributed to respiratory syncytial virus. Infants aged ≤6 months experience the most severe morbidity and mortality. Until recently, prevention with the monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, was only offered to infants with high-risk conditions, and treatment primarily consisted of supportive care. Currently, 2 products are approved for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus in infants. These include the Pfizer bivalent recombinant respiratory syncytial virus prefusion F protein subunit vaccine, administered seasonally to the pregnant person between 32 0/7 and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation, and the monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab, administered to infants aged up to 8 months entering their first respiratory syncytial virus season. With few exceptions, administering both the vaccine to the pregnant person and the monoclonal antibody to the infant is not recommended. All infants should be protected against respiratory syncytial virus using one of these strategies. Key considerations for pregnant individuals include examining available safety and efficacy data, weighing accessibility and availability, and patient preferences for maternal vaccination vs infant monoclonal antibody treatment. It will be critical for maternal-fetal medicine physicians to provide effective and balanced counseling to aid patients in deciding on a personalized approach to the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus in their infants.",0
Patient preferences for telehealth services in a large multispecialty practice.,"INTRODUCTION: Telehealth service provision has accelerated during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As the pandemic continues, clinical practices have discovered ways to resume operations. Opportunities exist to understand patient preferences for telehealth clinical services and to tailor offerings to different demographic groups. METHODS: We conducted a survey of patients receiving telehealth services through our outpatient practice to understand the types of healthcare services for which patients report preferences for telehealth. RESULTS: We received 551 survey responses (response rate = 20.8%; 551/2650). More than half of patients indicated being 'very likely' to use telehealth services to refill medication(s) (67.3%), prepare for an upcoming visit (66.1%), review test results (60.3%), or receive education (54.2%). Males had lower odds of preferring telehealth services for reviewing test results (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34-0.94) or mental health issues (OR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.38-0.77). Respondents who received a video visit were significantly more likely than those who received a telephone visit to report preferences for using telehealth for education, care plan discussions, long-term health issues, and mental health. DISCUSSION: Patient preferences for telehealth services vary by services provided and respondent demographics. Experience with telehealth increases the likelihood for future use of these services.",0
"Prevalence, attitudes and concerns toward telepsychiatry and mobile health self-management tools among patients with mental disorders during and after the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide survey in Poland from 2020 to 2023.","INTRODUCTION: Mobile Health (mHealth) is a rapidly growing field of medicine that has the potential to significantly change everyday clinical practice, including in psychiatry. The COVID-19 pandemic and technological developments have accelerated the adoption of telepsychiatry and mobile solutions, but patient perceptions and expectations of mHealth remain a key factor in its implementation. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess (1) the prevalence, (2) attitudes, preferences and (3) concerns about mobile mental health, including telepsychiatry and self-management tools, among patients with mental disorders over the period 2020-2023, i.e., at the onset, peak and after the expiration of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A semi-structured survey was administrated to 354 patients with mental disorders in Poland. The questions were categorized into three section, addressing prevalence, attitudes, and concerns about telepsychiatry and mobile health self-management tools. The survey was conducted continuously from May 2020 to the end of May 2023. RESULT: As many as 95.7% of patients with mental disorders used mobile devices at least once a week. Over the course of 3 years (from 2020 to 2023), there was a significant increase in the readiness of patients to embrace new technologies, with the percentage rising from 20% to 40%. In particular, a remarkable growth in patient preferences for telepsychiatry was observed, with a significant increase from 47% in 2020 to a substantial 96% in 2023. Similarly, mHealth self-management tools were of high interest to patients. In 2020, 62% of patients like the idea of using mobile apps and other mobile health tools to support the care and treatment process. This percentage also increased during the pandemic, reaching 66% in 2023. At the same time, the percentage of patients who have concerns about using m-health solutions has gradually decreased, reaching 35% and 28% in 2023 for telepsychiatry and for the reliability and safety of m-health self-management tools, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the growing acceptance of modern technologies in psychiatric care, with patients showing increased readiness to use telepsychiatry and mobile health self-management tools, in particular mobile applications, after the COVID-19 pandemic. This was triggered by the pandemic, but continues despite its expiry. In the face of patient readiness, the key issue now is to ensure the safety and efficacy of these tools, along with providing clear guidelines for clinicians. It is also necessary to draw the attention of health systems to the widespread implementation of these technologies to improve the care of patients with mental disorders.",0
Long-term outcomes of Gamma Knife radiosurgery in treating glossopharyngeal neuralgia.,"Glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN) is an unusual disorder causing severe, brief pain episodes in the areas supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve. Initial treatment involves medications like carbamazepine, but if these are ineffective or cause side effects, interventional pain management techniques or surgery may be considered. Gamma Knife radiosurgery is becoming popular in managing GPN due to its lower risk of complications than surgical interventions like microvascular decompression or rhizotomy. In this retrospective case series, we examined the outcomes of Gamma Knife radiosurgery in eight patients with GPN. The decision to utilize Gamma Knife radiosurgery was made following specific criteria, including failed surgical interventions, patient preference against surgery, or contraindications to surgical procedures. Patients were administered radiation doses within the range of 80 to 90 Gy, targeting either the cisternal glossopharyngeal nerve or glossopharyngeal meatus of the jugular foramen. Evaluations were conducted before the Gamma Knife radiosurgery; at 3, 6, and 12 months after Gamma Knife radiosurgery; and annually thereafter. Pain severity was assessed using the modified Barrow Neurological Institute scale grades, with patients achieving grade I-IIIa considered to have a good treatment outcome and grade IV-V to have a poor treatment outcome. Pain control and absence of radiosurgery-related complications were primary endpoints. The median age of the patients was 46.5 years, varying from 8 to 72 years. The median duration of pain was 32 months (range, 12-120 months). All patients, except one, were on polydrug therapy. All cases exhibited preoperative grade V pain. The median follow-up duration after Gamma Knife radiosurgery was 54.5 months, varying from 14 to 90 months. The overall clinical assessments revealed a gradual neurological improvement, particularly within the first 8.5 weeks (range, 1-12 weeks). The immediate outcomes at 3 months revealed that all patients (8/8, 100%) experienced pain relief, with 25% (2/8) achieving a medication-free status (Grade I). Three patients (37%) experienced a recurrence during the follow-up and were managed with repeat Gamma Knife radiosurgery (n = 2) and radiofrequency rhizotomy (n = 1). At the last follow-up, 88% (7/8) of patients had pain relief (Grades I-IIIa), with three (37%) achieving a medication-free status (Grade I). No adverse events or neurological complications occurred. The patient who underwent radiofrequency rhizotomy continued to experience inadequately controlled pain despite medication (Grade IV). Gamma Knife radiosurgery is a non-invasive, efficacious treatment option for idiopathic GPN, offering short- and long-term relief without permanent complications.",0
Implementation of a Standardized Shared Decision-making Bundle to Improve Communication Practices in the Neurocritical Care Unit.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Shared decision-making (SDM) aligns patient preferences with health care team treatment goals. This quality improvement initiative implemented a standardized SDM bundle within a neurocritical care unit (NCCU), where unique demands make existing, provider-driven SDM practices challenging. METHODS: An interprofessional team defined key issues, identified barriers, and created change ideas to drive implementation of an SDM bundle using the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Model for Improvement framework incorporating Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. The SDM bundle included (1) a health care team huddle pre-SDM and post-SDM conversation; (2) a social worker-driven SDM conversation with the patient family, including core standardized communication elements to ensure consistency and quality; and (3) an SDM documentation tool within the electronic medical record to ensure the SDM conversation was accessible to all health care team members. The primary outcome measure was percentage of SDM conversations documented. RESULTS: Documentation of SDM conversations improved by 56%, from 27% to 83% pre/postintervention. Average time to documentation decreased by 4 days, from day 9 preintervention to day 5 postintervention. There was no significant change in NCCU length of stay, nor did palliative care consultation rates increase. Postintervention, SDM team huddle compliance was 94.3%. DISCUSSION: A team-driven, standardized SDM bundle that integrates with health care team workflows enabled SDM conversations to occur earlier and resulted in improved documentation of SDM conversations. Team-driven SDM bundles have the potential to improve communication and promote early alignment with patient family goals, preferences, and values.",0
[Chronic Kidney Disease and Cancer: Ethical Choices].,"Cancer and chronic kidney disease prevalence both increase with age. As a consequence, physicians are more frequently encountering older people with cancer who need dialysis, or patients on dialysis diagnosed with cancer. Decisions in this context are particularly complex and multifaceted. Informed decisions about dialysis require a personalised care plan that considers the prognosis and treatment options for each condition while also respecting patient preferences. The concept of prognosis should include quality-of-life considerations, functional status, and burden of care. Close collaboration between oncologists, nephrologists, geriatricians and palliativists is crucial to making optimal treatment decisions, and several tools are available for estimating cancer prognosis, prognosis of renal disease, and general age-related prognosis. Decision regarding the initiation or the termination of dialysis in patients with advanced cancer have also ethical implications. This last point is discussed in this article, and we delved into ethical issues with the aim of providing a pathway for the nephrologist to manage an elderly patient with ESRD and cancer.",0
Patient preferences and comfort for cancer survivorship models of care: results of an online survey.,"PURPOSE: Workforce shortages will impact oncologists' ability to provide both active and survivorship care. While primary care provider (PCP) or survivorship clinic transition has been emphasized, there is little evidence regarding patient comfort. METHODS: We developed an online survey in partnership with patient advocates to assess survivors' comfort with PCP or survivorship clinic care and distributed the survey to online, cancer-specific patient communities from June to August 2020. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 975 surveys were complete. Most respondents were women (91%) and had private insurance (65%). Thirty-six cancer types were reported. Ninety-three percent had a PCP. Twenty-four percent were comfortable seeing a PCP for survivorship care. Higher odds of comfort were seen among respondents who were Black or had stage 0 cancer; female sex was associated with lower odds. Fifty-five percent were comfortable with a survivorship clinic. Higher odds of comfort were seen with lymphoma or ovarian cancer, > 15 years from diagnosis, and non-US government insurance. Lower odds were seen with melanoma, advanced stage, Medicaid insurance, and one late effect. Preference for PCP care was 87% for general health, 32% for recurrence monitoring, and 37% for late effect management. CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of cancer survivors were comfortable with PCP-led survivorship care and about half with a survivorship clinic. Most preferred oncologist care for recurrence monitoring and late-effect management. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Patient preference and comfort should be considered when developing survivorship care models. Future efforts should focus on facilitating patient-centered transitions to non-oncologist care.",0
Centering patient perspectives to achieve injury-related health equity in trauma care systems: Improving trauma registry data.,"BACKGROUND: Limitations in current data collection systems for patients who experience traumatic injury limit researchers' ability to identify and address disparities in injury and outcomes. We sought to develop and test a patient-centered data-collection system for equity-related data indicators that was acceptable to racially and ethnically diverse patients being treated for traumatic injuries. METHODS: Health equity indicators included in this study were race and ethnicity, language, education, employment, housing, and injury address. We conducted interviews with 245 racially and ethnically diverse trauma patients who were treated at a level-1 trauma center in the US in 2019-2020. We first interviewed 136 patients to develop a culturally resonant process and options for the health equity indicators to be added to a revised data collection system for the electronic medical record. English and Spanish interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim; qualitative analysis was used to assess patient preferences. We then pilot tested the revised data collection system with an additional 109 trauma patients to assess acceptability. Acceptability was defined as having more than 95% of participants self-identify with one of the proposed options for race/ethnicity, language, education, employment, and housing. Injury address (to identify geographic disparities) was pre-defined as acceptable if at least 85% of participants could identify exact address, cross streets, a landmark or business, or zip code of injury. RESULTS: A revised data collection system, including culturally resonant indicators and a process to be used by patient registrars to collect health equity data, was pilot tested, refined, and considered acceptable. Culturally resonant question phrasing/answer options for race/ethnicity, language, education, employment, housing status, and injury address were identified as acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a patient-centered data collection system for health equity measures with racially and ethnically diverse patients who have experienced traumatic injury. This system has the potential to increase data quality and accuracy, which is critical to quality improvement efforts and for researchers seeking to identify groups most impacted by racism and other structural barriers to equitable health outcomes and effective intervention points.",0
Satisfaction and preferences among patients with both implant-supported single crown and tooth-supported fixed dental prosthesis: a pilot study.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess patient-reported preferences and outcomes in patients rehabilitated with both an implant-supported single crown (ISC) and a tooth-supported fixed dental prosthesis (FDP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The electronic journal system at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Oslo, was searched to find patients presenting both an ISC and an FDP replacing no more than two teeth between abutments. Identified patients that agreed answered a questionnaire followed by a clinical examination. Descriptive statistics was calculated. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included. The mean function time was 11.8 years for FDPs and 6.6 years for ISCs. All but three patients were satisfied with both rehabilitation modalities. No patients were unsatisfied with aesthetics or function of either rehabilitation. All patients reported satisfactory function of their restorations and reported chewing without problems. The self-reported post-operative complications were few, but less than observed in the clinical examinations. CONCLUSIONS: More patients reported food impaction with their FDP as compared to their ISC. Function and aesthetics of FDPs and ISCs were rated similarly, but more patients found the ISC treatment more uncomfortable. Despite this finding, most patients would prefer to undergo ISC treatment if they were to replace another missing tooth.",0
The art of diabetes care: guidelines for a holistic approach to human and social factors.,"A holistic approach to diabetes considers patient preferences, emotional health, living conditions, and other contextual factors, in addition to medication selection. Human and social factors influence treatment adherence and clinical outcomes. Social issues, cost of care, out-of-pocket expenses, pill burden (number and frequency), and injectable drugs such as insulin, can affect adherence. Clinicians can ask about these contextual factors when discussing treatment options with patients. Patients' emotional health can also affect diabetes self-care. Social stressors such as family issues may impair self-care behaviors. Diabetes can also lead to emotional stress. Diabetes distress correlates with worse glycemic control and lower overall well-being. Patient-centered communication can build the foundation of a trusting relationship with the clinician. Respect for patient preferences and fears can build trust. Relevant communication skills include asking open-ended questions, expressing empathy, active listening, and exploring the patient's perspective. Glycemic goals must be personalized based on frailty, the risk of hypoglycemia, and healthy life expectancy. Lifestyle counseling requires a nonjudgmental approach and tactfulness. The art of diabetes care rests on clinicians perceiving a patient's emotional state. Tailoring the level of advice and diabetes targets based on a patient's personal and contextual factors requires mindfulness by clinicians.",0
Designing Clinical MRI for Enhanced Workflow and Value.,"MRI is an expensive and traditionally time-intensive modality in imaging. With the paradigm shift toward value-based healthcare, radiology departments must examine the entire MRI process cycle to identify opportunities to optimize efficiency and enhance value for patients. Digital tools such as ""frictionless scheduling"" prioritize patient preference and convenience, thereby delivering patient-centered care. Recent advances in conventional and deep learning-based accelerated image reconstruction methods have reduced image acquisition time to such a degree that so-called nongradient time now constitutes a major percentage of total room time. For this reason, architectural design strategies that reconfigure patient preparation processes and decrease the turnaround time between scans can substantially impact overall throughput while also improving patient comfort and privacy. Real-time informatics tools that provide an enterprise-wide overview of MRI workflow and Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS)-integrated instant messaging can complement these efforts by offering transparent, situational data and facilitating communication between radiology team members. Finally, long-term investment in training, recruiting, and retaining a highly skilled technologist workforce is essential for building a pipeline and team of technologists committed to excellence. Here, we highlight various opportunities for optimizing MRI workflow and enhancing value by offering many of our own on-the-ground experiences and conclude by anticipating some of the future directions for process improvement and innovation in clinical MR imaging.

Patient Portal Privacy: Perspectives of Adolescents and Emerging Adults Living with HIV and the Parental/Guardian Role in Supporting Their Care.,"BACKGROUND: Increasing the percentage of people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), including youth, who are virally suppressed to 95% is an overall goal of the ending the HIV epidemic initiative. While patient portals have become ubiquitous, questions remain about how best to operationalize parental/guardian access to youth's patient portals in alignment with optimizing HIV care outcomes and patient preferences. This qualitative study focuses on understanding perspectives among youth with HIV (YHIV) about parental access to patient portals. METHODS: Eligible participants were YHIV aged 13 to 25 years receiving care at an urban academic hospital. Semistructured individual/paired interviews were conducted between May 2022 and March 2023. Participants were asked to discuss thoughts on parental access to patient portals, and roles parents/guardians have in supporting their HIV care. Semistructured interviews were conducted with adolescent and emerging adult health care workers (HCWs) to gain perspectives on YHIV emergent themes. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim, and we conducted thematic analysis using an inductive approach to identify codes and themes. RESULTS: Sixteen YHIV and four HCWs participated in interviews. Parental roles in coordinating HIV care ranged from supporting YHIV needs for transportation, acquiring, and taking medications, to not having any role at all. Participants shared heterogeneous perspectives about their openness to share patient portal access with their parents/guardians. Perspectives were not strictly congruent along lines of participant age or parental roles in helping youth to manage HIV care. Sharing passwords emerged both as a pathway that YHIV grant access to their accounts and a source of confusion for clinicians when parents/guardians send messages using their child's account. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest HCWs should initiate conversations with YHIV patients to determine preferences for parental/guardian access to their patient portal, educate on proxy access, and explain the extent of medical information that is shared with proxy accounts, regardless of age and perceived parental involvement in HIV care.",0
Peer Support in Rheumatic Diseases: A Narrative Literature Review.,"Rheumatic diseases are a group of chronic conditions that are associated with significant morbidity, impaired physical function, psychosocial stress, and cost to the healthcare system. Peer support interventions have been shown to have a positive impact on health outcomes in several chronic conditions, but no review has specifically assessed the impact of peer support on rheumatic conditions. The aim of this narrative literature review was to understand how peer support has been applied in the field of rheumatology, with a specific focus on the impact of observational and randomized studies of direct peer support interventions on various outcome measures across rheumatic conditions. We also examined studies exploring patient attitudes and preferences toward peer support. The majority of studies included focused on peer support in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Generally, patients across the spectrum of rheumatic disease perceive peer support as a useful tool. Peer support interventions, while highly variable, were generally associated with positive impacts on health-related quality of life metrics (both perceived and measured), although these differences were not always statistically significant. Important limitations include variability in study design, selection bias among study participants, and short follow-up periods across most peer support interventions.",0
The relevance of fatigue to relapse rate in multiple sclerosis: Applying patient preference data to the OPTIMUM trial.,"BACKGROUND: In the OPTIMUM trial in patients with relapsing MS, treatment differences in annualized relapse rate (ARR, 0.088) and change in fatigue at week 108 (3.57 points, measured using the Fatigue Symptoms and Impacts Questionnaire-Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis, symptom domain (FSIQ-RMS-S)) favored ponesimod over teriflunomide. However, the importance of the fatigue outcome to patients was unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the importance of the OPTIMUM FSIQ-RMS-S results using data from an MS discrete choice experiment (DCE). METHODS: The DCE included components to correlate levels of physical and cognitive fatigue with FSIQ-RMS-S scores. Changes in relapses/year and time to MS progression equivalent to the treatment difference in fatigue in OPTIMUM were determined for similar fatigue levels as mean baseline fatigue in OPTIMUM. RESULTS: DCE participants would accept 0.06 more relapses/year or a 0.15-0.17 year decrease in time to MS progression for a 3.57-point difference in physical fatigue on the FSIQ-RMS-S. To improve cognitive fatigue by 3.57-points on the FSIQ-RMS-S, DCE participants would accept 0.09-0.10 more relapses/year or a 0.24-0.28 year decrease in time to MS progression. CONCLUSION: MS patients would accept 0.06 more relapses/year to change their fatigue by a similar magnitude as the between-treatment difference observed in the OPTIMUM trial.",1
"Evaluation of Orthodontic Treatment Method Preferences of Dentistry Students, Dentists and Orthodontic Residents.","OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate orthodontic treatment method preferences among dentistry students, dentists and orthodontic residents taking into account factors such as esthetics, advantage/disadvantage, cost and treatment duration. METHODS: The study was carried out on three groups: dentistry students (n=318), dentists (n=110) and orthodontic residents (n=98), and a 17-question survey was applied. Questionnaire forms included informational photos of conventional metal brackets (CMB), esthetic ceramic brackets (ECB), self-ligating brackets (SLB), clear aligner (CA), and lingual brackets (LB). The participants' preferences for orthodontic treatment methods were evaluated using chi-square analysis, not only between groups but also considering gender and income level. RESULTS: Regarding esthetics, dentists (41%) and orthodontic residents (78%) mostly preferred CA, while dentistry students mostly preferred LB (44%). With regard to advantage/disadvantage, dentistry students (31%) and dentists (39%) mostly preferred SLB, while orthodontic residents mostly preferred CA (55%). Regarding the success of the treatment, all three groups mostly preferred CMB. (respectively 50%; 47%; 72%). While CA was mostly preferred for short-term treatments in all three groups (respectively 40%; 71%; 88%), CMB was mostly preferred for long-term treatments (respectively 35%, 51%, 55%). Gender and income-level differences had little effect on orthodontic treatment method preferences. CONCLUSION: Except for long-term treatments and treatment success, there was generally great interest in CA, especially among orthodontic residents. Ceramic brackets and LB were generally the least preferred treatment methods among dentistry students, dentists, and orthodontic residents.",0
Center Hemodialysis Versus Peritoneal Dialysis: A Cost-Utility Analysis.,"Introduction Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) is needed for patients with end-stage kidney disease. While it is clear that kidney transplantation remains the gold standard in KRT, data comparing the cost-utility of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) are scarce. No such analysis has been performed for German patients.  Methods We used aggregated data generated by the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) for quality of life and insurance claims to evaluate mortality and economic impact. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and cost-utility were calculated accordingly.  Results PD is superior to HD within all dimensions of the SF-36, both in terms of QALY and cost-utility. The difference in cost per QALY between the aggregated physical dimensions (€50,671.54 vs. €39,745.77) is greater than that of the aggregated mental dimensions (€31,638.75 vs. €25,287.63). However, there is considerable variability among patients.  Conclusion From a health-economic point of view, PD should be preferred over HD when deciding on the KRT modality for the patient. This is not reflected in current practice, though. However, interindividual differences and patient preferences should be considered in the decision.",0
Nurses' Perceived Effects of Visitor Restrictions in Hospital Maternity Units.,"PURPOSE: To explore how perinatal nurses perceive the effects of visitor restrictions on patient care within a hospital setting. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We distributed a cross-sectional survey online to perinatal nurses in May of 2022. Characteristics of respondents were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Responses to an open-ended question were analyzed via conventional content analysis. RESULTS: Among our sample of 101 nurses, we identified seven codes representing positive effects and seven codes representing negative effects. The most frequently reported positive effects were ability to provide person-centered care (n = 36, 35.6%) and less patient stress and more rest (n = 29, 28.7%). The most frequently reported negative effects were limited patient support (n = 22, 21.8%) and emotional distress to the patient (n = 15, 14.9%). Fourteen percent (n = 14) of respondents cited both positive and negative effects. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Nurses perceived that visitor restrictions resulted in both positive and negative patient experiences. Balancing clinical needs and safety considerations with emotional needs of the childbearing individual requires careful consideration by maternity care clinicians and health care systems. Subsequent research is needed to determine optimal visitation policies during intrapartum and postpartum with consideration to hospital context and patient preferences for optimal care.",0
National trends in osteoporosis medication use among Medicare beneficiaries with and without Alzheimer's disease/related dementias.,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporotic fractures  are a leading cause of disability and premature death in the elderly. Patients with Alzheimer's and related dementia (ADRD) have high rates of osteoporosis (OP) and substantial risk of osteoporotic fractures. Yet research is sparse on trends and predictors of OP medication use in ADRD. METHODS: Medicare beneficiaries with OP aged ≥ 67 years have Medicare parts A/B/D without HMO from 2016 to 2018. Our outcome was receipt of OP medications in 2018. A multivariable logistic regression assessed association between ADRD and OP drug prescribing, adjusted for age, sex, race, region, Medicare entitlement, dual Medicaid eligibility, chronic conditions, number of provider visits/hospitalizations, and nursing home (NH) resident status. Age/ADRD and NH residency/ADRD interactions were tested. RESULTS: Our sample consisted of 47,871 people with OP and ADRD and 201,840 with OP without ADRD. OP drug use was 38.6% in ADRD patients vs. 52.7% in non-ADRD. After adjustment for demographics, chronic conditions, and previous hospitalizations/physician visits, the OR for OP drug in ADRD vs. non-ADRD was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.83-0.87). NH residents had lower odds for OP medication (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.58-0.64). There were significant interactions between ADRD and age, and between ADRD and NH residency. The OR for OP drug use associated with ADRD was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86-0.90) among community-dwelling elders and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.64-0.69) among NH residents. CONCLUSIONS: ADRD patients received OP drugs at a lower rate than their non-ADRD counterparts. More research is needed on when to prescribe or deprescribe OP drugs in the context of different ADRD severity, patient preferences, remaining life expectancy, and time-to-benefit from OP drugs.",0
Relugolix in Clinical Practice: The Best Route for All?,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been a mainstay of prostate cancer treatment for decades. Relugolix was FDA-approved in 2020 and is currently the only ADT option via an oral route. While the opportunity to use an oral medication for this indication has some advantages, a balanced discussion is required to understand in what clinical settings this agent truly has benefit over long-acting injectable formulations of ADT. Furthermore, patient preference, compliance, financial toxicity, and perhaps most importantly, pharmacologic characteristics must be considered.",0

Factors Affecting Recurrence of Idiopathic Granulomatous Mastitis: A Systematic Review.,"Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is a rare and benign disease that primarily affects young women of reproductive age. Various factors have been suggested as possible causes, including pregnancy, breastfeeding, history of taking birth control pills, hyperprolactinemia, smoking, and history of trauma. Due to unknown etiology, opinions on its treatment have varied, resulting in differing recurrence rates and side effects. Therefore, conducting a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis can aid in understanding the causes and recurrence of the disease, thereby assisting in the selection of effective treatment and improving the quality of life. A systematic literature review was conducted using predefined search terms to identify eligible studies related to risk factors and recurrence up to June 2022 from electronic databases. Data were extracted and subjected to meta-analysis when applicable. A total of 71 studies with 4735 patients were included. The mean age of the patients was 34.98 years, and the average mass size was 4.64 cm. About 3749 of these patients (79.17%) were Caucasian. Patients who mentioned a history of pregnancy were 92.65% with 76.57%, 22.7%, and 19.7% having a history of breastfeeding, taking contraceptive pills, and high prolactin levels, respectively. Around 5.6% of patients had previous trauma. The overall recurrence rate was 17.18%, with recurrence rates for treatments as follows: surgery (22.5%), immunosuppressive treatment (14.7%), combined treatment (14.9%), antibiotic treatment (6.74%), and observation (9.4%). Only antibiotic and expectant treatments had significant differences in recurrence rates compared to other treatments (p value = 0.023). In conclusion, factors such as Caucasian race, pregnancy and breastfeeding history, and use of contraceptive hormone are commonly associated with the disease recurrence. Treatment should be tailored based on symptom severity and patient preference, with surgery or immunosuppressive options for recurrence.",0
Selecting Optimal First-Line Treatment for Microsatellite Stable and Non-Mutated RAS/BRAF Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.,"Standard frontline treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is cytotoxic chemotherapy plus a biologic agent such as an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (cetuximab or panitumumab) or anti-VEGF antibody (bevacizumab). Predictive biomarkers include mismatch repair (MMR) status, and RAS and BRAF mutation status; and important factors in treatment selection include primary tumor location, intent of therapy, and potential toxicity, as well as patient age, comorbidities, and patient preference. To date, single-, double-, or triple-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy all have important roles in appropriately selected patients, with the addition of anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR antibody therapy based on the relevant predictive biomarker. Data indicate that patients with proficient MMR, RAS/BRAF wt mCRC are candidates for an anti-EGFR antibody plus doublet chemotherapy if they have a left-sided primary tumor, or for anti-VEGF (bevacizumab) plus doublet or triplet chemotherapy if they have a right-sided primary tumor. Future studies may provide more predictive biomarkers to further personalize therapy for this heterogeneous disease.",0
Shared decision making in the treatment of multiple sclerosis: A consensus based on Delphi methodology.,"Shared decision making is a way of incorporating patients' preferences and values into the decisions regarding the treatment and follow-up plan for the condition that affects them. It is currently applied mainly in the context of chronic disorders for which there is no cure available but nevertheless many therapeutic alternatives, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Current views and opinions on shared decision making for the treatment of MS are discussed in this consensus based on a modified Delphi method that included a group of neurologists from Argentina. A set of statements was defined by the experts and seeks to serve as a guide to apply this concept in clinical practice.",0
