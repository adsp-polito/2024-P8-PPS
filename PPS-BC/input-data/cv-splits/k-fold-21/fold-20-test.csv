Discrete choice experiment versus swing-weighting: A head-to-head comparison of diabetic patient preferences for glucose-monitoring devices.,"INTRODUCTION: Limited evidence exists for how patient preference elicitation methods compare directly. This study compares a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and swing-weighting (SW) by eliciting preferences for glucose-monitoring devices in a population of diabetes patients. METHODS: A sample of Dutch adults with type 1 or 2 diabetes (n = 459) completed an online survey assessing their preferences for glucose-monitoring devices, consisting of both a DCE and a SW exercise. Half the sample completed the DCE first; the other half completed the SW first. For the DCE, the relative importance of the attributes of the devices was determined using a mixed-logit model. For the SW, the relative importance of the attributes was based on ranks and points allocated to the 'swing' from the worst to the best level of the attribute. The preference outcomes and self-reported response burden were directly compared between the two methods. RESULTS: Participants reported they perceived the DCE to be easier to understand and answer compared to the SW. Both methods revealed that cost and precision of the device were the most important attributes. However, the DCE had a 14.9-fold difference between the most and least important attribute, while the SW had a 1.4-fold difference. The weights derived from the SW were almost evenly distributed between all attributes. CONCLUSIONS: The DCE was better received by participants, and generated larger weight differences between each attribute level, making it the more informative method in our case study. This method comparison provides further evidence of the degree of method suitability and trustworthiness.",1
Patients' Preferences Towards Decision Counseling for Active Surveillance After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy for Esophageal Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Decision counseling (DC) is offered to enable patients to reflect on their treatment preferences and to think through the consequences of alternative treatment options. However, the timing of DC is debatable. In this study, patients who underwent DC at different times were interviewed about their experiences, specifically focusing on the timing of DC. METHODS: Patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer eligible for participation in a prospective cohort study on active surveillance (SANO-2 study) were offered DC either before or after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). Structured interviews were conducted by phone 1 week after DC, and responses were analyzed using frequency counts for the answers to set response categories. The primary outcome was the preferred time to receive DC, while the secondary outcome was the overall experience of patients with DC. RESULTS: Overall, 40 patients were offered DC between 2021 and 2023. Patients who had counseling before the start of nCRT (n = 20) were satisfied with the timing of DC. Of the 20 patients who had DC after nCRT, 6 would have preferred counseling at an earlier time point. Patients who had DC both before or after the completion of nCRT reflected positively on DC. CONCLUSION: It is recommended to introduce the option of DC as early as possible and discuss with the patient at which moment during the decision-making process they prefer to discuss all treatment options more extensively.",0
Perspectives of people with HIV and HIV clinicians on characteristics of antiretroviral treatment and HIV-related symptoms.,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess HIV symptoms from the perspective of both patients and HIV specialists and the impact of discontinuing antiretroviral treatment (ART) on symptomology. We gathered opinions from HIV specialists and people living with HIV about ideal ART parameters and treatment satisfaction. METHODS: Ex post-facto cross-sectional surveys were administered to 502 people living with HIV and 101 HIV clinicians in Spain (18 sites). RESULTS: The median age of participants with HIV was 43.2 years, 74.5% were male, and 91.6% had an undetectable viral load. The mean time since initiation of ART was 10.2 years. Between 54% and 67% of people living with HIV reported experiencing nervousness or anxiety, sadness, fatigue, sleep problems, or muscle/joint pain during the preceding 4 weeks. However, only 22%-27% of specialists acknowledged the presence of these symptoms. The most bothersome symptoms were related to mental health or the central nervous system. There were significant differences between the burden of symptoms reported by people living with HIV and those acknowledged by specialists. The symptoms that more frequently caused ART discontinuation were depression, dizziness, and sleep problems. Both people living with HIV and specialists prioritized ART efficacy and low toxicity, but their importance ratings differed for 5 of the 11 ART characteristics assessed. People living with HIV rated their satisfaction with ART at a mean (± standard deviation) of 8.9 ± 1.5 out of 10, whereas HIV specialists rated it lower, at 8.3 ± 0.7 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in HIV care and treatment, a large proportion of patients still experience symptoms. HIV specialists may not be fully aware of these. People living with HIV and HIV specialists are, overall, satisfied with ART. However, the importance they place on different ART characteristics may vary.",0
Logical Inconsistencies with Expected Utility Theory May Align Better with Patient Preferences-A Response to Paulden et al.,.,0
Should we choose CT angiography first instead of SPECT/PET first for the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease?,"In patients presenting with chest pain, current guidelines recommend the use of coronary computed tomography angiography and single-photon emission tomography/positron emission tomography, both with equal class 1 indication and level of evidence A. There is no clear recommendation on which test should be used as a first-line test. The choice of the test should be based on individualized clinical risk assessment, patient characteristics, local expertise/availability, and patient preferences. In this context, it is fair to ask which non-invasive imaging test to choose. The debate reproduced in this article answers this question by summarizing the considerations in selecting present state-of-the-art criteria of the right test for the right patient to ensure efficient resource utilization, minimize unnecessary testing, and maximize diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic efficacy.",0
Do Orthopaedic Virtual Clinic Visits Demonstrate Cost and Time Efficiencies Compared With In-person Visits?,"BACKGROUND: There are numerous reasons for the increased use of telemedicine in orthopaedic surgery, one of which is the perception that virtual visits are more cost-effective than in-person visits. However, to our knowledge, no studies have compared the cost and time investment of virtual versus in-person visits using the time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) method. Unlike methods that estimate cost based on charges for services rendered, TDABC provides a more precise measurement of costs, which is essential for assessing cost-effective innovations and moving to value-based healthcare. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Are virtual visits less costly than analogous in-person visits, as measured by TDABC? (2) Does TDABC yield cost estimates that are lower or higher than the ratio of costs to charges (RCC), which is a simple, frequently used costing method? (3) Do the total time commitments of healthcare personnel, and that of the surgeon specifically, vary between the virtual and in-person settings? METHODS: Patients for this prospective, observational study were recruited from the practices of the highest-volume virtual-visit surgeons of three subspecialties (joints, hand, and sports) in a multihospital, tertiary-care academic institution in a metropolitan area in the Midwestern United States. Each surgeon had at least 10 years of clinical practice. Between June 2021 and September 2021, we analyzed both in-person and virtual return visits with patients who had an established relationship with the surgeon, because this represented the most frequent type of virtual visits and enabled a direct comparison between the two settings. New patients were not included in the study because of the limited availability of new-patient virtual visits; such patients often benefit from in-person physical examinations and on-site imaging. Additionally, patients seen for routine postoperative care were excluded because they were primarily seen in person by a physician assistant. Data were acquired during this period until 90 in-person and 90 virtual visits were collected according to selection criteria; no patients were lost to follow-up. Distinct process maps, which represent the steps involved in a clinic visit used to measure healthcare personnel time invested, were constructed for in-person and virtual clinic visits and used to compare total personnel and surgeon time spent. To calculate TDABC-derived costs, time allocated by personnel to complete each step was measured and used to calculate cost based on each personnel member's yearly salary. From the accounting department of our hospital, we acquired RCC cost data according to the level of service for a return visit. RESULTS: The total median cost, as measured by TDABC, was USD 127 (IQR USD 111 to 163) for an in-person visit and USD 140 (IQR USD 113 to 205) for a virtual visit (median difference USD 13; p = 0.16). RCC overestimated TDABC-calculated direct variable cost in five of six service levels (in-person levels 3, 4, and 5 and virtual levels 3 and 5) by a range of USD 25 to 88. Additionally, we found that virtual visits consumed 4 minutes less of total personnel time (in-person: 17 minutes [IQR 13.5 to 23.5 minutes], virtual: 13 minutes [IQR 11 to 19 minutes]; p < 0.001); however, this difference in personnel time did not equate to cost savings because surgeons spent 2 minutes longer on virtual visit activities than they did on in-person activities (in-person: 6 minutes [IQR 4.5 to 9.5 minutes], virtual: 8 minutes [IQR 5.5 to 13 minutes]; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Orthopaedic virtual visits did not deliver cost savings compared with in-person visits because surgeons spent more time on virtual visits and participated in virtual visits at the clinical site. Additionally, as anticipated, RCC overestimated costs as calculated by TDABC. These findings suggest that cost is not a primary advantage of transitioning to virtual visits, and that factors such as patient preference and satisfaction should be considered instead. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, economic and decision analysis.",0
Polygenic Risk Prediction in Diverticulitis.,"OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate a polygenic risk score (PRS) to predict the occurrence and severity of diverticulitis and to understand the potential for incorporation of a PRS in current decision-making. BACKGROUND: PRS quantifies genetic variation into a continuous measure of risk. There is a need for improved risk stratification to guide surgical decision-making that could be fulfilled by PRS. It is unknown how surgeons might integrate PRS in decision-making. METHODS: We derived a PRS with 44 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with diverticular disease in the UK Biobank and validated this score in the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI). We performed a discrete choice experiment of practicing colorectal surgeons. Surgeons rated the influence of clinical factors and a hypothetical polygenic risk prediction tool. RESULTS: Among 2812 MGI participants with diverticular disease, 1964 were asymptomatic, 574 had mild disease, and 274 had severe disease. PRS was associated with occurrence and severity. Patients in the highest PRS decile were more likely to have diverticulitis [odds ratio (OR)=1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.42-2.38)] and more likely to have severe diverticulitis (OR=1.61; 95% CI, 1.04-2.51) than the bottom 50%. Among 213 surveyed surgeons, extreme disease-specific factors had the largest utility (3 episodes in the last year, +74.4; percutaneous drain, + 69.4). Factors with strongest influence against surgery included 1 lifetime episode (-63.3), outpatient management (-54.9), and patient preference (-39.6). PRS was predicted to have high utility (+71). CONCLUSIONS: A PRS derived from a large national biobank was externally validated, and found to be associated with the incidence and severity of diverticulitis. Surgeons have clear guidance at clinical extremes, but demonstrate equipoise in intermediate scenarios. Surgeons are receptive to PRS, which may be most useful in marginal clinical situations. Given the current lack of accurate prognostication in recurrent diverticulitis, PRS may provide a novel approach for improving patient counseling and decision-making.",0
Is it preferable to administer a bronchodilator once- or twice-daily when treating COPD?,"Nocturnal and early morning symptoms are common and uncomfortable in many patients with COPD, and are likely to affect their long-term outcomes. However, it is still debated whether it is better to give long-acting bronchodilators once- or twice-daily to symptomatic COPD patients. The functional link between circadian rhythms of autonomic tone and airway calibre explains why the timing of administration of bronchodilators in chronic airway diseases can induce different effects when taken at different biological (circadian) times. However, the timing also depends on the pharmacological characteristics of the bronchodilator to be used. Because the profile of bronchodilation produced by once-daily vs. twice-daily long-acting bronchodilators differs throughout 24 h, selecting long-acting bronchodilators may be customized to specific patient preferences based on the need for further bronchodilation in the evening. This is especially helpful for people who experience respiratory symptoms at night or early morning. Compared to placebo, evening bronchodilator administration is consistently linked with persistent overnight improvements in dynamic respiratory mechanics and inspiratory neural drive. The current evidence indicates that nocturnal and early morning symptoms control is best handled by a LAMA taken in the evening. In contrast, it seems preferable to use a LABA for daytime symptoms. Therefore, it can be speculated that combining a LAMA with a LABA can improve bronchodilation and control symptoms better. Both LAMA and LABA must be rapid in their onset of action. Aclidinium/formoterol, a twice-daily combination, is the most studies of the available LAMA/LABA combinations in terms of impact on daytime and nocturnal symptoms.",0
Smartphone Application Versus Standard Instruction for Colonoscopic Preparation: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare smartphone application (Colonoscopic Preparation) instructions versus paper instructions for bowel preparation for colonoscopy. BACKGROUND: Adhering to bowel preparation instructions is important to ensure a high-quality colonoscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled trial included individuals undergoing colonoscopy at a tertiary care hospital. Individuals were randomized (1:1) to receive instructions through a smartphone application or traditional paper instructions. The primary outcome was the quality of the bowel preparation as measured by the Boston Bowel Preparation Score. Secondary outcomes included cecal intubation and polyp detection. Patient satisfaction was assessed using a previously developed questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 238 individuals were randomized (n = 119 in each group), with 202 available for the intention-to-treat analysis (N = 97 in the app group and 105 in the paper group). The groups had similar demographics, indications for colonoscopy, and type of bowel preparation. The primary outcome (Boston Bowel Preparation Score) demonstrated no difference between groups (Colonoscopic Preparation app mean: 7.26 vs paper mean: 7.28, P = 0.91). There was no difference in cecal intubation (P = 0.37), at least one polyp detected (P = 0.43), or the mean number of polyps removed (P = 0.11). A higher proportion strongly agreed or agreed that they would use the smartphone app compared with paper instructions (89.4% vs 70.1%, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone instructions performed similarly to traditional paper instructions for those willing to use the application. Local patient preferences need to be considered before making changes in the method of delivery of medical instructions.",0
'CROSS'-ing into the 'Real World': a retrospective cohort study of patients receiving trimodality and bimodality therapy for esophageal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: A standard of care for nonmetastatic esophageal cancer is trimodality therapy consisting of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and esophagectomy, with evidence for improved overall survival versus surgery alone in the ChemoRadiotherapy for Oesophageal cancer followed by Surgery Study (CROSS) trial. Patients who receive treatment with curative intent but are poor candidates for or decline surgery receive definitive bimodality therapy. Literature characterizing patients who receive bimodality therapy compared to trimodality therapy, and their relative outcomes, is sparse, especially among patients who are too old or too frail to qualify for clinical trials. In this study, we assess a single-institution real-world dataset of patients receiving bimodality and trimodality management. METHODS: Patients treated for clinically resectable, nonmetastatic esophageal cancer between 2009 and 2019 who received bimodality or trimodality therapy were reviewed, generating a dataset of 95 patients. Clinical variables and patient characteristics were assessed for association with modality on multivariable logistic regression. Overall, relapse-free, and disease-free survival were assessed with Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional modeling. For patients nonadherent to planned esophagectomy, reasons for nonadherence were recorded. RESULTS: Bimodality therapy was associated with greater age-adjusted comorbidity index, worse performance status, higher N-stage, presenting symptom other than dysphagia, and held chemotherapy cycles on multivariable analysis. Compared to bimodality therapy, trimodality therapy was associated with higher overall (3-year: 62% vs. 18%, P<0.001), relapse-free (3-year: 71% vs. 18%, P<0.001), and disease-free (3-year: 58% vs. 12%, P<0.001) survival. Similar results were observed among patients who did not meet CROSS trial qualifying criteria. Only treatment modality was associated with overall survival after adjusting for covariates (HR 0.37, P<0.001, reference group: bimodality). Patient choice accounted for 40% of surgery nonadherence in our population. CONCLUSIONS: Patients receiving trimodality therapy were observed to have superior overall survival compared to bimodality therapy. Patient preference for organ-preserving therapies appears to impact resection rate; further characterization of patient decision-making may be helpful. Our results suggest patients who wish to prioritize overall survival should be encouraged to pursue trimodality therapy and obtain early consultation with surgery. Development of evidence-based interventions to physiologically prepare patients before and during neoadjuvant therapy as well as efforts to optimize the tolerability of the chemoradiation plan are warranted.",0
Shared decision making in patients with substance use disorders: A one-year follow-up study.,"Patient-centered care in therapeutic processes has been associated with better clinical outcomes, however, it remains a poorly studied aspect in Substance Use Disorder (SUD). The study aimed to evaluate patient's preferences, perceived participation in treatment decisions and activation level; and how they predict retention, pharmacological adherence and substance use during one-year follow-up. Logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between independent variables, along with a wide number of sociodemographic and clinical covariates, and outcomes. Most patients prefer a shared or passive role when making decisions about their treatment, and showed concordance between their preferred and perceived roles. In the univariate models, perceiving more involvement than desired showed a higher likelihood of treatment discontinuation at 12 months, and substance use at 6 and 12 months. No significant associations were found between the remaining decisional variables or the degree of activation with the assessed outcomes. A majority of SUD patients prefer and perceive to be involved in the decision-making process about their treatment. Patients perceiving more involvement than desired might experience an excess of responsibility that could negatively influence treatment continuation and substance use. Limitations of the study preclude any definitive conclusion, and more research is needed to confirm these results.",0
"Understanding Patient Perspectives on Specialized, Longitudinal, Postpartum, Cardiovascular Risk-Reduction Clinics.","BACKGROUND: Females who experience hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) have an increased lifelong risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, Canadian clinical practice guidelines recommend cardiovascular risk reduction follow-up after a patient has HDP. This study examined the experiences of patients with HDP who attended a specialized, longitudinal general internal medicine postpartum cardiovascular risk reduction clinic called PreVASC. PreVASC focuses on comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction through cardiovascular risk factor screening and management tailored specifically for female patients after they have HDP. METHODS: This multimethod study examined the experiences of female patients with HDP via the following: (i) a quantitative survey (summarized with descriptive statistics); (ii) semistructured qualitative patient phone interviews (results grouped thematically); and (iii) triangulation of qualitative themes with quantitative survey results. RESULTS: Overall, 37% of eligible clinic patients (42 of 115) participated; 79% of participants (n = 33) reported being ""very satisfied"" with the PreVASC clinic's specialized longitudinal model of care, and 95% (n = 40) reported making at least one preventive health behaviour change after receiving individualized counselling on cardiovascular risk reduction. Qualitative results found improvements in patient-reported cardiovascular health knowledge, health behaviours, and health-related anxiety. A preference for in-person vs phone clinic visits was reported by participants. CONCLUSIONS: An in-person, general internal medicine specialist-led, longitudinal model of cardiovascular disease preventive care focused specifically on cardiovascular risk reduction after HDP had positive impacts on patient experience, health knowledge, and preventive health behaviours. This novel knowledge on patient preferences for a longitudinal, specialized model of care advances cardiovascular risk reduction tailored specifically for high-risk people after HDP.",0
Urethral Bulking With Polyacrylamide Hydrogel Compared With Other Treatments for Stress Urinary Incontinence: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.,"Our objective was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing polyacrylamide hydrogel urethral bulking with other surgical and nonsurgical treatments for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). We created a cost-effectiveness analysis using TreeAge Pro, modeling eight SUI treatments. Treatment with midurethral sling (MUS) had the highest effectiveness (1.86 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), followed by polyacrylamide hydrogel (1.82 QALYs), with a difference (Δ 0.02/year) less than the minimally important difference for utilities of 0.03 annually. When the proportion of polyacrylamide hydrogel urethral bulking procedures performed in the office setting is greater than 58%, polyacrylamide hydrogel is a cost-effective treatment for SUI, along with pessary, pelvic floor physical therapy, and MUS. Although MUS is more effective and, therefore, the preferred SUI treatment, polyacrylamide hydrogel is a reasonable alternative depending on patient preferences and treatment goals.",0
What landscape elements are needed for hospital healing spaces? Evidence from an empirical study of 10 compact hospitals.,"BACKGROUND: Modern medical research shows that a rationally planned landscape environment helps patients recover. With the growing number of hospital patients and the tightening of per capita medical landscape land, the use of limited landscape resources to serve patients has become challenging. METHODS: This study focused on the landscape environment of 10 hospitals in Guangdong Province, China. Based on the KANO theoretical model, a survey questionnaire was designed and administered to 410 participants. The data were analyzed based on demand attributes, importance, sensitivity, and group differences. RESULTS: The maintenance requirements were the most important item in the sensitivity ranking. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that the users need a safe, quiet, and private environment, owing to their higher requirements, including visual healing, rehabilitation activities, shading and heat preservation, and medical escort. Moreover, adolescents and older adult patients have common and contradictory environmental needs. For example, the landscape environment should provide both an active space and a quiet rehabilitation environment. CONCLUSION: This study evaluates how landscape resources can be better utilized from the perspective of the user and expands the theory of healing landscapes, which has practical implications for hospital renovation and landscape environment strategies.",0
Analysis of patients' thoughts and background factors influencing attitudes toward Deprescribing: interviews to obtain hints for highly satisfying and valid prescriptions.,"BACKGROUND: Prescribing with high levels of medical appropriateness and patient satisfaction improves adherence. However, its appropriateness does not always match patient preference. Deprescription is important for ensuring the safety of medication therapy, but is not straightforward. Although successful deprescribing requires knowledge of patients' thoughts on their prescriptions and factors that influence their acceptance of deprescribing, few comprehensive studies have been conducted on this topic. The aim of this study was to identify factors that influence patients' attitudes toward deprescribing and obtain hints on how to achieve higher patient satisfaction and prescribing adequacy. METHODS: A questionnaire was administered to hospitalized patients and a logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine factors that influence their attitude toward deprescribing. Individual factors affecting patients' thoughts and wishes regarding prescribing were extracted and analysed in detail. RESULTS: The analysis included 106 patients, of whom 40 (37.7%) wished deprescribing. Logistic regression analysis showed that ""Age"", ""Wish to reduce the number and types of medications"", ""Satisfaction"", ""Concerns about side effects"", and ""Wish not to have certain medications changed"" were factors influencing attitudes toward deprescribing. The results suggested that the factors were influenced by patients' perceptions and individual patient backgrounds. There was a gap between willingness to reduce medication and to change their medications. Seventy-eight percent of all respondents indicated that they would like to reduce the number and type of pills they take if possible. However, only 44.6% of these patients indicated that they would actually like to change their medication. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the only one to comprehensively investigate prescription content, patient background, and patients' thoughts on factors influencing attitudes toward deprescribing. This study revealed five factors that can influence inclination toward deprescribing. In addition, the results suggest that patients want to be able to feel well with fewer medications if possible. This information may be useful in determining prescriptions that have high validity and patient satisfaction. Further research is needed on the gap between willingness to reduce medications and to change medications.",0
Patient Preferences in Metastatic Breast Cancer Care: A Scoping Review.,"People with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) have diverse medical, physical, and psychosocial needs that require multidimensional care. Understanding patient preferences is crucial to tailor treatments, services, and foster patient-centered care. A scoping review was performed to summarize the current evidence on the preferences of people with MBC regarding their care to identify knowledge gaps and key areas for future research. The Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycInfo databases were searched. Twenty studies enrolling 3354 patients met the study eligibility criteria. Thirteen quantitative studies, four mixed methods studies, and three qualitative studies were included. Seven studies captured healthcare provider perspectives; thirteen studies evaluated patient preferences relating specifically to cancer treatments; three studies evaluated preferences relating to supportive care; and four studies evaluated communication and decision-making preferences. The current literature evaluating MBC patient preferences is heterogeneous with a focus on cancer treatments. Future research should explore patient preferences relating to multidisciplinary, multi-modal care that aims to improve quality of life. Understanding MBC patient preferences regarding their comprehensive care can help tailor healthcare delivery, enhance the patient experience, and improve outcomes.",1
Mobile health applications for epilepsy in Indian app stores: A systematic review and content analysis using the mobile app rating scale.,"OBJECTIVE: The growing prevalence of smartphones may prompt individuals with epilepsy to pursue unfulfilled healthcare requirements through mobile health (mHealth) apps, but the content and quality of these mHealth apps are rarely analysed. Hence, this study aimed to identify and assess the quality of epilepsy apps for patients with epilepsy (PWE), their caregivers, and healthcare practitioners (HCPs) available in the Play Store and App Store of India. METHODS: We performed a systematic search on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store of India to identify the mHealth apps for epilepsy which were released and updated till May 2023. The identified applications were downloaded and the quality was assessed using a Mobile app rating scale (MARS) for the overall quality, Aesthetics, Engagement, Functionality, and Information by three independent reviewers. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to assess the interrater reliability between the reviewers. An unpaired t-test was calculated to analyse the difference in mean scores for Android and iOS applications. RESULTS: The systematic search yielded a total of 2518 apps, out of which 26 were selected for inclusion in the study. Among these, 9 apps were compatible with Android, 11 with iOS, and 6 on both platforms. The mean (SD) MARS score of the apps was 3.5 (0.6) and the ICC for the overall app quality was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82-0.96). Overall, apps scored highest in functionality (3.9), followed by aesthetics (3.6), information (3.3), and engagement (3.2). Among the included apps, the overall quality score was found to be higher for iOS apps than Android (MD = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.02 - 1.07; p-value: 0.042). CONCLUSION: Our study identified twenty-six mHealth applications for epilepsy that integrated various aspects of epilepsy self-management. The results of this study emphasize the importance of ensuring that current and future applications offer evidence-based information, integrate features that align with patient preferences, and generate evidence regarding the effectiveness of application usage.",0
Development and validation of a psoriasis treatment acceptability measure through group concept mapping.,"BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a common autoimmune dermatologic condition which has a pronounced negative impact on patient quality of life and disease burden. Currently, there are a number of treatments available for psoriasis, with differences in efficacy, mechanism of action, mode of administration, adverse effects, and tolerability. However, a reliable, validated patient-reported instrument to address patient expectations and of psoriasis treatment has not been developed. This project was undertaken with the aim of developing a fit-for-purpose self-reported instrument to inform patient expectations and preferences of psoriasis treatments. METHODS: Two studies, both utilizing qualitative and quantitative methods, were conducted in patients within the entire spectrum of psoriasis severity. In Study 1, a group concept mapping (GCM) exercise was conducted with dermatologists and moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients to identify concepts important in the treatment of psoriasis. In Study 2, a preliminary Treatment Acceptability Questionnaire (TAQ) was developed using GCM-derived concepts from Studies 1 and 2, followed by cognitive debriefing (CD) telephone interviews of the preliminary TAQ. In Study 2, another GCM exercise was conducted with mild and newly diagnosed psoriasis patients. Psychometric analyses were performed on the TAQ to evaluate validity and reliability. RESULTS: The Study 1 GCM exercise generated 43 concepts from moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients (n = 20) and dermatologists (n = 10). In Study 2, 37 GCM concepts were generated from mild and newly diagnosed psoriasis patients (n = 20). From the 2 GCM exercises, 28 concepts were selected to form the preliminary TAQ; CD interviews indicated strong understanding and relevance of TAQ items among patients with disease ranging from mild to severe. The final TAQ consisted of 20 items; psychometric analysis demonstrated strong validity and reliability of the TAQ. CONCLUSIONS: The TAQ is a novel psychometrically validated patient-reported instrument to inform healthcare providers of patients' expectations of and preferences for treatment of their psoriasis and can help in shared decision making between patients and physicians.",1
"""Your cancer is no longer considered cancer"": Psychological reactions to reclassification information and communication preferences.","OBJECTIVE: In 2016, the encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (EFVPTC) was reclassified as noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP). This reclassification removed the word ""carcinoma"" and the definition of cancer from the diagnosis. While the nomenclature change was expected to psychologically impact patients, that question has not been systematically explored. Using qualitative methods, we aimed to explore the psychological impact of reclassification on thyroid cancer patients and their preferences for receiving reclassification information. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with nine non-EFVPTC thyroid cancer survivors were conducted. Participants were presented with a hypothetical reclassification scenario, and interview transcripts were analyzed using a thematic content analytic approach. RESULTS: Participants expressed a range of psychological reactions to reclassification information, primarily negative, including anger, mistrust, and uncertainty, but also relief. All participants expressed difficulty understanding the concept of reclassification. Communication preferences favored conversation with an established medical provider over written materials, such as a letter. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Communication must align with patient preferences. Being mindful of potential negative psychological reactions when providing information on cancer reclassification is vital. INNOVATION: This study examines reactions to cancer reclassification information and preferences for how this information should be communicated.",0
An update on absolute and relative indications for dialysis treatment modalities.,"BACKGROUND: Choosing a dialysis modality is an important decision for people to make as their kidney failure progresses. In doing so, their options should be informed by any absolute or relative indications that may favour one modality over another. METHODS: In creating this update, we reviewed literature using a framework that considered first, high-level outcomes (survival and modality transition) from large registry data and cohort studies when considering optimal patient pathways; second, factors at a dialysis provider level that might affect relative indications; and third, specific patient-level factors. Both main types of dialysis modality, peritoneal (PD) and haemodialysis (HD), and their subtypes were considered. RESULTS: For most people starting dialysis, survival is independent of modality, including those with diabetes. Better survival is seen in those with less comorbidity starting with PD or home HD, reflecting continued improvements over recent decades that have been greater than improvements seen for centre HD. There are provider-level differences in the perceived relative indications for home dialysis that appear to reflect variability in experience, prejudice, enthusiasm, and support for patients and carers. Absolute contraindications are uncommon and, in most cases, where modality prejudice exists, e.g. obesity, Adult Polycystic Kidney Disease, and social factors, this is not supported by reported outcomes. CONCLUSION: Absolute contraindications to a particular dialysis modality are rare. Relative indications for or against particular modalities should be considered but are rarely more important than patient preferences.",0
"""It's That They Treated Me Like an Object"": A Qualitative Study on the Participation of People Diagnosed with Psychotic Disorders in Their Health Care.","The mental health recovery model is based on shared decision making, in which patients' preferences and perceptions of the care received are taken into account. However, persons with psychosis usually have very few opportunities to participate in this process. The present study explores the experiences and perceptions of a group of patients with psychosis-in some cases longstanding, in others more recently diagnosed-concerning their participation in the decisions taken about the approach to their condition and about the attention received from healthcare professionals and services. For this purpose, we performed a qualitative analysis of the outcomes derived from five focus groups and six in-depth interviews (36 participants). Two major themes, with five sub-themes, were identified: shared decision-making (drug-centred approach, negotiation process, and lack of information) and the care environment and styles of clinical practice as determinants (aggressive versus person-centred environments, and styles of professional practice). The main conclusions drawn are that users want to participate more in decision making, they want to be offered a range of psychosocial options from the outset and that their treatment should be based on accessibility, humanity and respect. These findings are in line with the guidelines for clinical practice and should be taken into account in the design of care programmes and the organisation of services for persons with psychosis.",0
The impact of adding platelet-rich plasma during fat graft myringoplasty for managing medium-sized tympanic membrane perforations: A prospective randomized case-control study.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of adding platelet-rich plasma (PRP) during FGM to close medium-sized TM perforations. METHODS: This prospective randomized case-control study was conducted from February 2017 to March 2022. We included 320 patients with a medium-sized TM perforation with inactive mucosal otitis media. Transcanal FGM managed all patients under general or local anesthesia according to the patient preference. According to PRP, patients were divided into two groups: the first with PRP (170 patients) and the other without PRP (150 patients). We evaluated the closure rate of both groups one month, six months, and one year after the surgery. Also, we assessed the audiological performance before and one year after the operation for the patients with a successful closure. RESULTS: The closure rate was 87.6 % in the first group and 72.7 % in the second group, with a statistically significant difference between both groups as the P-value, was 0.001. Successful closure of the ABG to <10 dB occurred in 95.3 % of group A and 90.8 % of group B without a statistically significant difference between both groups (P-value = 0.163). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective comparative study on a relatively large number of patients revealed that FGM effectively closed medium-sized TM perforations. It also significantly improved postoperative audiological performance in both groups. Adding PRP during the FGM enhanced the closure success and the healing process without recorded complications. We recommend using the PRP in the routine FGM for closing medium-sized TM perforations.",0
Interest in advance provision of abortion pills: a national survey of potential users in the USA.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess interest in clinician-administered advance provision of abortion pills among potential users in the USA. METHODS: Using social media advertisements, we recruited people living in the USA who were aged 18-45 years and assigned female at birth, who were not pregnant or planning pregnancy, for an online survey on reproductive health experiences and attitudes. We explored interest in advance provision of abortion pills, participant characteristics, including demographics and pregnancy history, contraceptive use, abortion knowledge and comfort, and healthcare system distrust. We used descriptive statistics to assess interest in advance provision, and ordinal regression modelling to evaluate differences in interest controlling for age, pregnancy history, contraceptive use, familiarity and comfort with medication abortion, and healthcare system distrust, reporting adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: From January-February 2022, we recruited 634 diverse respondents from 48 states, among whom 65% were interested, 12% neutral, and 23% disinterested in advance provision. There were no differences among interest groups by US region, race/ethnicity, or income. In the model, variables associated with interest included being aged 18-24 years (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.4) versus 35-45 years, using a tier 1 (permanent or long-acting reversible) or tier 2 (short-acting hormonal) contraceptive method (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.1, and aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.9, respectively) versus no contraception, being familiar or comfortable with the medication abortion process (aOR 4.2, 95% CI 2.8 to 6.2, and aOR 17.1, 95% CI 10.0 to 29.0, respectively), and having high healthcare system distrust (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.4) versus low distrust. CONCLUSION: As abortion access becomes more constrained, strategies are needed to ensure timely access. Advance provision is of interest to the majority of those surveyed and warrants further policy and logistical exploration.",0
How should patient decision aids for schizophrenia treatment be designed? - A scoping review.,"Despite the clear rationale for applying shared decision-making in the context of the preference sensitive decision for or against antipsychotics and the upswing of patient decision aids (pDAs) to support this process, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding which key features are crucial for pDAs in schizophrenia treatment. A scoping review according to the PRISMA-SRc was conducted to inform on crucial key features and quality indicators. The review focussed on the following seven aspects for investigating pDAs: (1) Types of decision aids, (2) Values, (3) Decision Guidance, (4) Output of the decision aid, (5) Target group, (6) Effectiveness according to publication and (7) Decision aid evaluation. Eleven studies which addressed six unique decision aids met the eligibility criteria. There were major differences in the design as well as in the development of the decision aids. Three aspects emerged that should be given special consideration in the design of such tools for antipsychotics: the evidence used by the decision aid, the algorithm for translating evidence into a decision aid and finally the presentation of the evidence. We recommend the use of data with a high level of evidence and to combine it with individualized treatment by taking into account patient preferences and previous experiences as well as comparing them with clinical assessments. Fully computerized decision aids that use complicated algorithms, for example, by merging treatment effects with patient characteristics to suggest an appropriate treatment at the end, tend to be paternalistic and thus not appropriate for SDM, in our view. In addition, possible cognitive deficits need to be considered when presenting the output of decision aids for antipsychotics.",0
Patient preferences for physical therapy programs after a lower extremity fracture: a discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify patients' preferences for physical therapy programmes after a lower extremity fracture and determine patient factors associated with preference variation. DESIGN: Discrete choice experiment. SETTING: Level I trauma centre. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty-one adult (≥18 years old) patients with lower extremity fractures treated operatively. INTERVENTION: Patients were given hypothetical scenarios and asked to select their preferred therapy course when comparing cost, mobility, long-term pain, session duration, and treatment setting. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A multinomial logit model was used to determine the relative importance and willingness to pay for each attribute. RESULTS: Mobility was of greatest relative importance (45%, 95% CI: 40% to 49%), more than cost (23%, 95% CI: 19% to 27%), long-term pain (19%, 95% CI: 16% to 23%), therapy session duration (12%, 95% CI: 9% to 5%) or setting (1%, 95% CI: 0.2% to 2%). Patients were willing to pay US$142 more per session to return to their preinjury mobility level (95% CI: US$103 to US$182). Willingness to pay for improved mobility was higher for women, patients aged 70 years and older, those with bachelor's degrees or higher and those living in less-deprived areas. Patients were willing to pay US$72 (95% CI: US$50 to US$93) more per session to reduce pain from severe to mild. Patients were indifferent between formal and independent home therapy (willingness to pay: -US$12, 95% CI: -US$33 to US$9). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lower extremity fractures highly value recovering mobility and are willing to pay more for postoperative physical therapy programmes that facilitate returning to their pre-injury mobility level. These patient preferences might be useful when prescribing and designing new techniques for postoperative therapy.",1
Denosumab versus pamidronate in the treatment of osteolytic bone metastases secondary to breast cancer: a multi-institutional analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and most often metastasizes to the bone, resulting in skeletal-related events (SREs). Bone-modifying agents (BMAs) including denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-b ligand (RANKL), and pamidronate, a bisphosphonate, are used to prevent these adverse events. METHODS: To analyze the efficacy of denosumab versus pamidronate, we used the TriNetX research platform and compared the outcomes of pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, and overall 5-year survival rate between each pharmacotherapy. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference for an increased risk in pathological fractures (2.7% vs. 2.8%, P = 0.88), spinal cord compression (2.6% vs. 2.7%, P = 0.88), or 5-year survival rate (45.5% vs. 52.4%, P = 0.78) for the denosumab cohort versus the pamidronate cohort. CONCLUSION: Since neither therapy showed an increased risk in the adverse effects measured in this study, factors such as patient preference, financial costs, and additional side effects of each medication should be taken into consideration when choosing a therapy for bone metastases in patients with breast cancer.",0
An innovative approach to recruiting participants for dementia research: primary care and researcher perspectives.,"Aim: To describe clinician and researcher perceptions of a new, patient preference focused approach to recruiting patients for research from primary care-based memory clinics. Methods: Memory clinic clinicians completed a survey and key informants completed an individual interview to gather their perceptions of this new program. Results: The majority of clinicians were 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with this recruitment approach and indicated that this approach would have minimal negative impact on patient care or create conflict of interest. Key informants valued the program for its patient-centred approach, the integration of research into care and potential for increased recruitment. Discussion: These findings are suggestive of support for this recruitment approach. Pilot testing will inform feasibility, effectiveness and process improvements.",0
Acceptability and Preference for Human Papilloma Virus Self-Sampling among Thai Women Attending National Cancer Institute.,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer screening is an important public health strategy to reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Human papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling is the alternative method that can potentially increase participation in cervical cancer screening. This study aimed to evaluate the acceptability of HPV self-sampling as a primary cervical cancer screening among Thai women. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at National Cancer Institute, Thailand, between March and September 2021. Eligible women were invited to collect their own samples with a vaginal cotton swab for cervical screening. The data on demographics, acceptability, and preference for HPV self-sampling were collected via a self-administered questionnaire. A Likert scale was used to assess the response of self-sampling acceptability. The multivariable logistic regression determined factors that influence preference for HPV self-sampling. RESULTS: A total of 265 participants were recruited. Over 70% agreed that self-sampling was easy, less embarrassing, and not painful. They also felt confident in their ability to self-sample correctly and would recommend this method to a friend or relative. For their next screening round, 66.4% preferred self-sampling whereas 33.6% preferred clinician-collected samples as routine screening. The factors that influence preference for self-sampling were age, marital status, feeling less embarrassed, and confidence in performing the tests. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the study participants accepted HPV self-sampling. This suggests that the self-sampling method will be an additional option to increase cervical cancer screening coverage which leads to improving the effectiveness of the national program.",0
Patient experiences of undergoing abortion with and without an ultrasound scan in Britain.,"BACKGROUND: Routine ultrasound scanning to determine gestational age and pregnancy location has long been part of pre-abortion assessment in Britain, despite not being legally required or recommended in national clinical guidelines. To support implementation of fully telemedical abortion care (implemented in Britain in April 2020), the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) issued clinical guidance for an 'as-indicated' approach to pre-abortion ultrasound, removing the need for a clinic visit. We aimed to understand patient experiences of ultrasound in abortion care by conducting a qualitative study with individuals who had abortions with and without an ultrasound scan. METHODS: Between November 2021 and July 2022, we recruited patients who had a medical abortion at home without a pre-procedure ultrasound at 69 days' gestation or less at British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), and also had at least one other abortion with an ultrasound from any provider in Britain. We conducted interviews using a semi-structured interview guide to explore our participants' experiences and conducted reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: We recruited 24 participants and included 19 interviews in our analysis. We developed three themes from our data. These were 'Ultrasound scans and their relationship with autonomy and decision-making', 'Intrusive and out of place: the ultrasound as an inappropriate technology' and 'Towards preference-centred, quality care'. CONCLUSIONS: Further research and user-testing of strategies to improve the scan experience should be undertaken. Patient testimonies on the negative impact of ultrasound scans in abortion care should reassure providers that omitting them according to patient preference is a positive step towards providing patient-centred care.",0
[Analysis of the experience and procedural complications of trans-radial access versus trans-femoral access for hepatic arterial perfusion chemotherapy in patients with advanced hepatic malignancies:a retrospective study].,"Objective: To analyze the differences between trans-radial access (TRA) and trans-femoral access (TFA) in hepatic arterial perfusion chemotherapy (HAIC) in terms of patient experience, postoperative complications, and patient preferences; explore whether TRA in HAIC is associated with better patient experience and compliance; and determine whether it is safer than TFA. Methods: The study was a retrospective cohort study of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastases from colorectal cancer treated with HAIC. We enrolled a total of 91 patients with advanced liver malignancies treated with HAIC from November 2022 to May 2023 in the Department of Interventional Therapy and Hepatobiliary Medicine at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital. The patients were divided into three groups: group TRA (n=20, receiving TRA HAIC only), group TFA (n=33, receiving TFA HAIC only), and crossover group [n=19, receiving TFA HAIC (Cross-TFA group) first, followed by TRA HAIC (Cross-TRA group)]. Meanwhile, to facilitate the expression of partial results, all patients receiving TRA HAIC were defined as the TRA-HAIC group (n=39, TRA+Cross-TRA group), and all patients receiving TFA HAIC were defined as the TFA-HAIC group (n=52, TFA+Cross-TFA group). The primary research index was the Quality of Life (QOL) visualization scale score. The secondary research index included approach-related and catheter-related adverse events, duration of surgery, and mean length of patient stay. We used various statistical methods such as Mann-Whitney U test, t-test, Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, univariate logistic regression analysis, and multi-factor analysis. Results: TRA patients had significantly lower QOL scores than TFA patients (all P<0.001). The QOL scores of the Cross-TRA group were significantly lower than those of the Cross-TFA group (pain at the puncture site Z=-3.24, P=0.001, others P<0.001). The QOL scores of the Cross-TRA group were compared with those of the TRA group, which showed that the scores of the Cross-TRA group in overall discomfort (Z=-3.07,P=0.002), postoperative toilet difficulty (Z=-2.12, P=0.034), and walking difficulty (Z=-2.58, P=0.010) were significantly lower than those of the TRA group. Satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the Cross-TRA group than in the Cross-TFA group (Z=-3.78, P<0.001), and patients were more likely to receive TRA HAIC as the next procedure (χ(2)=30.42, P<0.001). In terms of mean length of stay, patients receiving TRA HAIC had a significantly lower mean length of stay than those receiving TFA HAIC (50.1±3.2 h vs. 58.4±6.4 h, t=7.98, P<0.001). The incidence of radial artery occlusion (RAO) as an approach-related adverse event was 15.4% (6/39) in the TRA-HAIC group, which was significantly higher than that in the TFA-HAIC group (15.4% vs. 0, χ(2)=8.56, P=0.005). Notably, multifactorial analysis of RAO-related factors showed that intraoperative enoxaparin use and patency of radial artery flow during pressure were significantly associated with a reduced risk of postoperative RAO (P=0.037 for enoxaparin use and P=0.049 for pressure). Conclusions: With respect to procedure approach, TRA was significantly better than TFA in terms of patient satisfaction and mean length of stay. Through further process optimization and prevention of adverse reactions, the incidence of adverse reactions can be maintained at a relatively low level, so that patients can benefit from TRA in future operations in terms of cost-effectiveness and medical efficiency.",0
Individualizing Medicinal Therapy Post Heart Stent Implantation: Tailoring for Patient Factors.,"The field of cardiovascular medicine is undergoing a transformative shift towards personalized medicinal therapy, particularly in the context of post stent implantation. This narrative review explores the significance, challenges, and future directions of individualized treatment strategies for patients with coronary stents. The review highlights the pivotal role of personalized approaches in optimizing treatment efficacy and minimizing adverse events. Real-world clinical studies and trials underscore the importance of tailoring antiplatelet therapy based on platelet function testing, genetic testing, and risk scoring. These studies reveal that personalized medicinal treatment improves clinical outcomes by balancing preventing thrombotic events and mitigating bleeding risks. Challenges, including cost, test availability, patient adherence, and ethical considerations, are discussed in depth, shedding light on the complexities of implementing personalized approaches. Technological advancements, including omics data integration, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics, shape the future of personalized medicinal therapy. These tools enable precise pharmacogenomic selection of medications and the development of integrated risk-scoring systems. Patient engagement and education are also central, with empowered patients and remote monitoring contributing to collaborative decision-making. In conclusion, the narrative review underscores that personalized medicinal therapy post stent implantation holds immense promise for revolutionizing cardiovascular care. By embracing a comprehensive approach that considers genetics, clinical factors, and patient preferences, healthcare providers can optimize treatment outcomes and improve patient quality of life. The evolving landscape of personalized medicine offers a glimpse into a future where tailored treatment strategies become the cornerstone of precision cardiovascular care.",0
Preferences of Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease for Invasive Versus Conservative Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndrome: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"Background Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can experience acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with high morbidity and mortality. Early invasive management of ACS is recommended for most high-risk patients; however, choosing between an early invasive versus conservative management approach may be influenced by the unique risk of kidney failure for patients with CKD. Methods and Results This discrete choice experiment measured the preferences of patients with CKD for future cardiovascular events versus acute kidney injury and kidney failure following invasive heart procedures for ACS. The discrete choice experiment, consisting of 8 choice tasks, was administered to adult patients attending 2 CKD clinics in Calgary, Alberta. The part-worth utilities of each attribute were determined using multinomial logit models, and preference heterogeneity was explored using latent class analysis. A total of 140 patients completed the discrete choice experiment. The mean age of patients was 64 years, 52% were male, and mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 37 mL/min per 1.73 m(2). Across the range of levels, risk of mortality was the most important attribute, followed by risk of end-stage kidney disease and risk of recurrent myocardial infarction. Latent class analysis identified 2 distinct preference groups. The largest group included 115 (83%) patients, who placed the greatest value on treatment benefits and expressed the strongest preference for reducing mortality. A second group of 25 (17%) patients was identified who were procedure averse and had a strong preference toward conservative management of ACS and avoiding acute kidney injury requiring dialysis. Conclusions The preferences of most patients with CKD for management of ACS were most influenced by lowering mortality. However, a distinct subgroup of patients was strongly averse to invasive management. This highlights the importance of clarifying patient preferences to ensure treatment decisions are aligned with patient values.",1
Primary prevention of cancer-associated venous thrombosis: Rationale and challenges in clinical practice.,"Cancer-associated venous thrombosis (CAT) is a common, multifactor event known to complicate the course of cancer and jeopardize a patient's prognosis. The current guidelines regarding the prevention of CAT are sometimes considered insufficiently precise about specific situations, or are poorly applied. The expected benefits of thromboprophylaxis are balanced by the risk of major bleeding induced by anticoagulation, which implies a need to accurately identify ambulatory patients at high risk of thrombosis or hemorrhage. The Khorana score is commonly used for this, but is limited by the non-reproducibility of predicted performance across cancer types, and by the fact that antitumor treatment and cardiovascular risks are not included. The COMPASS-CAT score, which includes those two aspects, was found to be a more accurate predictor of venous thromboembolism in patients with lung cancer, and to better distinguish between patients at low or high risk of thrombosis. The frailty of patients with cancer is also a major issue, and should be taken into account when thromboprophylaxis is considered. According to current guidelines, CAT prophylaxis should be considered for hospitalized patients, those for whom surgery is scheduled, or those with pancreatic cancers. In ambulatory patients, decisions should be made according to patient, cancer and antitumoral treatment characteristics. Low molecular weight heparin is the gold standard of CAT prophylaxis. Despite increased risks of bleeding or drug-drug interactions in cancer patients, direct oral anticoagulants could be alternate options for high-risk ambulatory patients that should be accompanied by a careful global analysis of benefits, harms, and patient preferences.",0
Nursing leadership to facilitate patient participation in fundamental care: An ethnographic qualitative study.,"AIMS: To explore and describe hospital nurses' perceptions of leadership behaviours in facilitating patient participation in fundamental care. DESIGN: An ethnographic interview study. METHODS: Individual semi-structured interviews with 12 nurses with a bachelor's or master's degree working at a university medical centre were conducted between February and April 2021. The interview data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Six themes were derived from the data: (1) nursing leadership; (2) patient participation; (3) using patients' preferences; (4) building relationships; (5) task-focused nursing; (6) need for role modelling. CONCLUSION: Nurses indicated leadership behaviour to facilitate patient participation in fundamental care as inviting patients to participate and eliciting and supporting patients' preferences. Although nurses also regarded leadership as motivating colleagues to act and enhancing evidence-based practice, they appeared not to practise this themselves about patient participation. Role modelling was indicated as a need for improvement. IMPACT: The findings established that not all leadership behaviours mentioned were used in practice about patient participation in fundamental care. Role modelling and the use of evidence-based practice are needed to increase patient participation. Further research will be necessary to develop and test leadership interventions to improve patient participation in fundamental care.",0
Group sequential two-stage preference designs.,"The two-stage preference design (TSPD) enables inference for treatment efficacy while allowing for incorporation of patient preference to treatment. It can provide unbiased estimates for selection and preference effects, where a selection effect occurs when patients who prefer one treatment respond differently than those who prefer another, and a preference effect is the difference in response caused by an interaction between the patient's preference and the actual treatment they receive. One potential barrier to adopting TSPD in practice, however, is the relatively large sample size required to estimate selection and preference effects with sufficient power. To address this concern, we propose a group sequential two-stage preference design (GS-TSPD), which combines TSPD with sequential monitoring for early stopping. In the GS-TSPD, pre-planned sequential monitoring allows investigators to conduct repeated hypothesis tests on accumulated data prior to full enrollment to assess study eligibility for early trial termination without inflating type I error rates. Thus, the procedure allows investigators to terminate the study when there is sufficient evidence of treatment, selection, or preference effects during an interim analysis, thereby reducing the design resource in expectation. To formalize such a procedure, we verify the independent increments assumption for testing the selection and preference effects and apply group sequential stopping boundaries from the approximate sequential density functions. Simulations are then conducted to investigate the operating characteristics of our proposed GS-TSPD compared to the traditional TSPD. We demonstrate the applicability of the design using a study of Hepatitis C treatment modality.",0
Effects of decision aids on breast reconstruction: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate the effects of decision aids for women facing breast reconstruction decision on decision conflict, decision regret, knowledge, satisfaction, anxiety and depression. BACKGROUND: Breast reconstruction decision is not good or bad and should be guided by clinical evidence and patient preferences. Decision aids can increase the patient's decision-making enthusiasm and ability, improve the quality of decision and promote shared decision-making between patients and medical staff. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Eight databases were conducted from the establishment of the database until October 2021. The PRISMA checklist was selected for analysis in this paper. The meta-analysis was conducted in Review Manager 5.3. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The result is decision conflict, decision regret, knowledge and other secondary outcomes. Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were also conducted. RESULTS: A total of twelve randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed that decision aids could significantly reduce decision conflict and decision regret, improve knowledge, satisfaction and depression and had no influence on anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the systematic review and meta-analysis reviewed the positive effect of decision aids on the decision-making of women facing postmastectomy breast reconstruction. In the future, more well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm the effects of decision aids on the decision-making of breast reconstruction and nurses should be encouraged to take part in the development of decision aids in accordance with strict standards and apply them to breast cancer patients considering postmastectomy breast reconstruction. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Our study provides evidence for the effectiveness of decision aids on breast reconstruction and points to the important role of healthcare providers in the use of decision aids and in facilitating shared decision-making.",0
Long-Term Outcome of Intact Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm After Endovascular or Open Repair.,"OBJECTIVE: Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) has been established as a standard treatment option for intact abdominal aortic aneurysm (iAAA) and gained importance due to a lower perioperative mortality than open repair (OAR). However, whether this survival advantage can be maintained or if OAR is beneficial in terms of long-term complications and reinterventions remains questionable. DESIGN: In this retrospective cohort study data from patients undergoing elective EVAR or OAR for iAAAs in the years 2010-2016 was analyzed. The patients were followed through 2018. METHODS: In the propensity score matched cohorts the perioperative and long-term outcomes of the patients were assessed. We identified 20 683 patients undergoing elective iAAA repair (76.4% EVAR). The propensity matched cohorts included 4886 pairs of patients. RESULTS: The perioperative mortality was 1.9% for EVAR and 5.9% for OAR (P = <.001). The perioperative mortality was mainly influenced by patients age (Odds-Ratio (OR):1.073, confidence interval (CI):1.058-1.088, P ≤ .001) and OAR (OR:3.242, CI:2.552-4.119, P ≤ .001). The early survival benefit after endovascular repair persisted for approximately 3 years (estimated survival EVAR 82.3%, OAR 80.9%, P = .021). After that time the estimated survival curves were similar. After 9 years the estimated survival was 51.2% after EVAR as compared to 52.8% after OAR (P = .102). The operation method didn't influence long-term survival significantly (Hazard-Ratio (HR): 1.046, CI: .975-1.122, P = .211). The vascular reintervention rate was 17.4% in the EVAR cohort and 7.1% in the OAR cohort (P ≤ .001). CONCLUSION: EVAR has a significantly lower perioperative mortality than OAR, a survival benefit that lasts up to 3 years after intervention. Thereafter, no significant difference in survival was observed between EVAR and OAR. The decision between EVAR or OAR may depend on patient preference, surgeons' experience, and the institutions' ability to handle complications.",0
US Residents' Preferences for Sharing of Electronic Health Record and Genetic Information: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim to this study was to assess preferences for sharing of electronic health record (EHR) and genetic information separately and to examine whether there are different preferences for sharing these 2 types of information. METHODS: Using a population-based, nationally representative survey of the United States, we conducted a discrete choice experiment in which half of the subjects (N = 790) responded to questions about sharing of genetic information and the other half (N = 751) to questions about sharing of EHR information. Conditional logistic regression models assessed relative preferences across attribute levels of where patients learn about health information sharing, whether shared data are deidentified, whether data are commercialized, how long biospecimens are kept, and what the purpose of sharing the information is. RESULTS: Individuals had strong preferences to share deidentified (vs identified) data (odds ratio [OR] 3.26, 95% confidence interval 2.68-3.96) and to be able to opt out of sharing information with commercial companies (OR 4.26, 95% confidence interval 3.42-5.30). There were no significant differences regarding how long biospecimens are kept or why the data are being shared. Individuals had a stronger preference for opting out of sharing genetic (OR 4.26) versus EHR information (OR 2.64) (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Hospital systems and regulatory bodies should consider patient preferences for sharing of personal medical records or genetic information. For both genetic and EHR information, patients strongly prefer their data to be deidentified and to have the choice to opt out of sharing information with commercial companies.",1
Multidisciplinary Guidelines for the Rational Use of Topical Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs for Musculoskeletal Pain (2022).,"(1) Background: Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the primary drugs for treating musculoskeletal pain. However, there are currently no evidence-based recommendations about drug selection, drug administration, drug interactions, and use in special populations or other pharmacology-related content of such medications. To this end, the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association Hospital Pharmacy Professional Committee developed multidisciplinary guidelines on using topical NSAIDs to treat musculoskeletal pain. (2) Methods: The guidelines development process followed the World Health Organization guideline development handbook, the GRADE methodology, and the statement of Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Healthcare. The guideline panel used the Delphi method to identify six clinical questions to be addressed in the guidelines. An independent systematic review team conducted a systematic search and integration of evidence. (3) Results: Based on the balance between the benefits and harms of an intervention, the quality of the evidence, patient preferences and values, and resource utilization, the guideline panel developed 11 recommendations and nine expert consensuses on using topical NSAIDs to treat acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain. (4) Conclusions: Based on the effectiveness and overall safety of topical NSAIDs, we recommend patients with musculoskeletal pain use topical NSAIDs and suggest high-risk patients use topical NSAIDs, such as those with other diseases or receiving other concurrent treatments. The evidenced-based guidelines on topical NSAIDs for musculoskeletal pain incorporated a pharmacist perspective. The guidelines have the potential to facilitate the rational use of topical NSAIDs. The guideline panel will monitor the relevant evidence and update the recommendations accordingly.",0
Method for Calculating the Simultaneous Maximum Acceptable Risk Threshold (SMART) from Discrete-Choice Experiment Benefit-Risk Studies.,"BACKGROUND: Medical decisions require weighing expected benefits of treatment against multiple adverse outcomes under uncertainty (i.e., risks) that must be accepted as a bundle. However, conventional maximum acceptable risk (MAR) estimates derived from discrete-choice experiment benefit-risk studies evaluate the acceptance of individual risks, assuming other risks are fixed, potentially leading decision makers to misinterpret levels of risk acceptance. DESIGN: Using simulations and a published discrete-choice experiment, we demonstrate a method for identifying multidimensional risk-tolerance measures given a treatment level of benefit. RESULTS: Simultaneous Maximum Acceptable Risk Thresholds (SMART) represents combinations of risks that would be jointly accepted in exchange for specific treatment benefits. The framework shows how the expectation of utility associated with treatments that involve multiple risks are related even when preferences for potential adverse events are independent. We find that the form of the marginal effects of adverse-event probabilities on the expected utility of treatment determines the magnitude of differences between SMART and conventional single-outcome MAR estimates. LIMITATIONS: Preferences for potential adverse events not considered in a study or preferences for adverse-event attributes held constant in risk-tolerance calculations may affect estimated risk tolerance. Further research is needed to understand the right balance between realistically reflecting clinical treatments with many potential adverse events and the cognitive burden of evaluating risk-risk tradeoffs in research and in practice. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: SMART analysis should be considered in preference studies evaluating the joint acceptance of multiple potential adverse events. HIGHLIGHTS: Conventional approaches to calculate maximum-acceptable risk (MAR) using discrete-choice experiment data account for 1 adverse-event risk at a time, requiring that decision makers infer the acceptability of treatments when patients are exposed to multiple risks simultaneously.The Simultaneous Maximum Acceptable Risk Threshold (SMART) maps combinations of adverse-event risks that would be jointly acceptable given a specific treatment benefit and provides a transparent and precise portrayal of acceptance of multiple risks.Risk levels that would be accepted using individual MAR estimates might not be acceptable when simultaneous risks are considered, especially when marginal expected disutility of risk is decreasing nonlinearly with risk probabilities.Preference researchers should calculate SMARTs in any discrete-choice study in which 2 or more adverse-event risks are presented, particularly if risk preferences are nonlinear.",1
Patient and clinician perspectives of information needs concerning oral epithelial dysplasia.,"OBJECTIVES: Individuals diagnosed with a chronic oral disease that increase the risk of mouth cancer, such as oral epithelial dysplasia (OED), require appropriate knowledge to make informed decisions. The present study aimed to assess whether patient information needs of a group of patients concerning dysplasia were met and to what degree clinicians agree with patients on 'important' topics. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This represented secondary analyses of a cross-sectional study to assess the information needs of 86 patients diagnosed with dysplasia compared with those of 77 clinicians using the validated OED Information Needs Questionnaire. Descriptive, concordance and regression analyses were performed for the collected data. RESULTS: The mean and median total scores for all items in the amount of information received subscale were 2.33 and 2.44, indicating overall unmet needs concerning dysplasia. Clinicians were generally able to predict topics of greatest importance to patients, although their scores were mainly lower than those of patients (k = 0.06). There was a higher agreement between patients (k = 0.25) than clinicians (k = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Clinicians are encouraged to assess a patient's information needs to ensure tailored and patient-centred communication concerning OED during all clinical consultations.",0

"Real-world Prescription Patterns and Patient Satisfaction Regarding Maintenance Therapy of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: An Observational, Cross-sectional, Multicenter Study.","BACKGROUND/AIMS: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder that typically requires long-term maintenance therapy. However, little is known about patient preferences and satisfaction and real-world prescription patterns regarding maintenance therapy for GERD. METHODS: This observational, cross-sectional, multicenter study involved patients from 18 referral hospitals in Korea. We surveyed patients who had been prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for GERD for at least 90 days with a minimum follow-up duration of 1 year. The main outcome was overall patient satisfaction with different maintenance therapy modalities. RESULTS: A total of 197 patients were enrolled. Overall patient satisfaction, patient preferences, and GERD health-related quality of life scores did not significantly differ among the maintenance therapy modality groups. However, the on-demand therapy group experienced a significantly longer disease duration than the continuous therapy group. The continuous therapy group demonstrated a lower level of awareness of potential adverse effects associated with PPIs than the on-demand therapy group but received higher doses of PPIs than the on-demand therapy group. The prescribed doses of PPIs also varied based on the phenotype of GERD, with higher doses prescribed for non-erosive reflux disease than erosive reflux disease. CONCLUSION: Although overall patient satisfaction did not significantly differ among the different PPI maintenance therapy modality groups, awareness of potential adverse effects was significantly different between the on-demand and continuous therapy groups.",0
Outcomes that matter most to burn patients: A national multicentre survey study in the Netherlands.,"BACKGROUND: The use of patient-reported outcomes to improve burn care increases. Little is known on burn patients' views on what outcomes are most important, and about preferences regarding online Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs). Therefore, this study assessed what outcomes matter most to patients, and gained insights into patient preferences towards the use of online PROMs. METHODS: Adult patients (≥18 years old), 3-36 months after injury completed a survey measuring importance of outcomes, separately for three time periods: during admission, short-term (<6 months) and long-term (6-24 months) after burn injury. Both open and closed-ended questions were used. Furthermore, preferences regarding the use of patient-reported outcome measures in burn care were queried. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients were included (response rate: 27%). 'Not having pain' and 'good wound healing' were identified as very important outcomes. Also, 'physical functioning at pre-injury level', 'being independent' and 'taking care of yourself' were considered very important outcomes. The top-ten of most important outcomes largely overlapped in all three time periods. Most patients (84%) had no problems with online questionnaires, and many (67%) indicated that it should take up to 15 minutes. Patients' opinions differed widely on the preferred frequency of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Not having pain and good wound healing were considered very important during the whole recovery of burns; in addition, physical functioning at pre-injury level, being independent, and taking care of yourself were deemed very important in the short and long-term. These outcomes are recommended to be used in burn care and research, although careful selection of outcomes remains crucial as patients prefer online questionnaires up to 15 minutes.",0
A qualitative exploration of allied health providers' perspectives on cultural humility in palliative and end-of-life care.,"BACKGROUND: Cultural factors, including religious or cultural beliefs, shape patients' death and dying experiences, including palliative and end-of-life (EOL) care preferences. Allied health providers must understand their patients' cultural preferences to support them in palliative and EOL care effectively. Cultural humility is a practice which requires allied health providers to evaluate their own values, biases, and assumptions and be open to learning from others, which may enhance cross-cultural interactions by allowing providers to understand patients' perceptions of and preferences for their health, illness, and dying. However, there is limited knowledge of how allied health providers apply cultural humility in palliative and EOL care within a Canadian context. Thus, this study describes Canadian allied health providers' perspectives of cultural humility practice in palliative and EOL care settings, including how they understand the concept and practice of cultural humility, and navigate relationships with patients who are palliative or at EOL and from diverse cultural backgrounds. METHODS: In this qualitative interpretive description study, remote interviews were conducted with allied health providers who currently or recently practiced in a Canadian palliative or EOL care setting. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using interpretive descriptive analysis techniques. RESULTS: Eleven allied health providers from the following disciplines participated: speech-language pathology, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and dietetics. Three themes were identified: (1) Interpreting and understanding of cultural humility in palliative and EOL care (i.e., recognizing positionality, biases and preconceived notions and learning from patients); (2) Values, conflicts, and ethical uncertainties when practicing cultural humility at EOL between provider and patient and family, and within the team and constraints/biases within the system preventing culturally humble practices; (3) The 'how to' of cultural humility in palliative and EOL care (i.e., ethical decision-making in palliative and EOL care, complexities within the care team, and conflicts and challenges due to contextual/system-level factors). CONCLUSIONS: Allied health providers used various strategies to manage relationships with patients and practice cultural humility, including intra- and inter-personal strategies, and contextual/health systems enablers. Conflicts and challenges they encountered related to cultural humility practices may be addressed through relational or health system strategies, including professional development and decision-making support.",0
Health-related quality of life in early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma: a longitudinal analysis of the ABVD arm in the randomized controlled trial HD.6.,"Early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma has become one of the most curable hematologic malignancies. Depending upon the disease location, possible toxicities, and patient preference, chemotherapy alone with ABVD remains an accepted treatment modality for this disease. There remains a paucity of data regarding the longitudinal trajectory of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients treated for HL. The impact of disease and treatment on HRQoL is increasingly important to understand as the number of long-term survivors increases. We report the longitudinal HRQoL using data prospectively collected from diagnosis up to 10 years post-treatment in the ABVD arm of the HD.6 randomized controlled trial for early-stage HL patients (N=169). We analyzed HRQoL using the EORTC QLQ-C30 collected at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after completion of chemotherapy and yearly up to year 10. Clinically and statistically significant improvements were noted for specific domains including emotional (3 months post-treatment), social (12 months post-treatment) and financial functioning (2 years post-treatment), and the specific symptom of fatigue (6 months post-treatment) during the follow-up period. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective, longitudinal analysis of HRQoL specifically among patients with early-stage HL treated with ABVD therapy alone. Although improvements were noted, sustained clinically and statistically significant improvements were noted only in select symptoms emphasizing the need to better understand and optimize HRQoL among this patient group.",0
Quantifying stakeholders' preference for implantable medical devices in China: a discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to gain insight into each attribute as presented in the value of implantable medical devices, quantify attributes' strength and their relative importance, and identify the determinants of stakeholders' preferences. METHODS: A mixed-methods design was used to identify attributes and levels reflecting stakeholders' preference toward the value of implantable medical devices. This design combined literature reviewing, expert's consultation, one-on-one interactions with stakeholders, and a pilot testing. Based on the design, six attributes and their levels were settled. Among 144 hypothetical profiles, 30 optimal choice sets were developed, and healthcare professionals (decision-makers, health technology assessment experts, hospital administrators, medical doctors) and patients as stakeholders in China were surveyed. A total of 134 respondents participated in the survey. Results were analyzed by mixed logit model and conditional logit model. RESULTS: The results of the mixed logit model showed that all the six attributes had a significant impact on respondents' choices on implantable medical devices. Respondents were willing to pay the highest for medical devices that provided improvements in clinical safety, followed by increased clinical effectiveness, technology for treating severe diseases, improved implement capacity, and innovative technology (without substitutes). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of DCE will improve the current evaluation on the value of implantable medical devices in China and provide decision-makers with the relative importance of the criteria in pricing and reimbursement decision-making of implantable medical devices.",1
How important it is to know the preferences of the diabetic patient.,.,0
[Participation of Patients in the Development of Clinical Guidelines: A Selective Country Comparison in a Narrative Review].,"AIM: A clinical practice guideline aims to optimize patient care by recommending diagnostic or treatment pathways, based on the best available research and practical experience. Therefore, the needs and preferences of patients and their families should be incorporated. The aim of this study was to examine regulations and standards of patient involvement in guideline development, using a selective comparison of countries. METHOD: Information was extracted from publicly available websites and guidelines development manuals for the United Kingdom (UK), the United States, Canada, and Australia. They were compared and discussed in a narrative review. RESULTS: In the UK, at least two people from among patients or the public must be involved in all guideline development committees and during all stages of the development process. The US National Academy of Medicine recommends active participation in guideline development groups by patients with disease-specific experience and patient representatives from the public. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care wants patient preferences to be involved, especially in the development of final guideline recommendations and usability testing. In Australia, guidelines receive the approval or seal of approval of the National Health and Medical Research Council if at least one patient representative can be shown to have been a member of the committee and to have been involved in the entire process of guideline development. CONCLUSION: The selective country comparison shows that patient involvement in guideline development and the binding nature of the rules vary considerably, and that there are no uniform standards for involvement. Many issues of involvement are unresolved, and special sensitivity will be needed to bring together the life and experiences of patients/laypersons and the medical system on an equal footing.",0
Defining inappropriate thyroid biopsy?-Proposed definition based on clinical evidence and stakeholder engagement.,"PURPOSE: Identify factors that can be used to assess the appropriateness of a thyroid biopsy and propose a pathway to define inappropriate thyroid biopsies in practice. METHODS: We identified factors utilized in clinical guidelines and existing literature to determine the clinical indications for a thyroid biopsy. Subsequently, we assembled a multidisciplinary panel of experts, including patients, clinicians, researchers, and quality experts, to integrate these factors and develop a pathway for assessing the appropriateness of thyroid biopsies. RESULTS: Through literature review and stakeholder engagement, we identified multiple factors to determine if a thyroid biopsy is necessary: ultrasound risk assessment, presence of compressive symptoms and/or clinical suspicion of high-risk thyroid cancer, life expectancy, comorbidity burden, surgical risk, personal risk factors for thyroid cancer, thyroid function levels, local resources and medical expertise and patient values and preferences. We proposed a multiple-tier classification for the appropriateness of thyroid biopsy that begins with ultrasound findings (e.g., size, thyroid cancer risk) and encompasses the evaluation of additional patient-specific factors. CONCLUSION: Assessment of the appropriateness of a thyroid biopsy is possible. Although, thyroid nodule ultrasound risk assessment is a pivotal factor for this assessment, additional factors should be considered (e.g., life expectancy, personal risk factors for thyroid cancer, patient preferences). Yet, additional efforts are needed to operationalize the objective implementation of these factors in clinical practice.",0
Patient perceptions of in-hospital laboratory blood testing: A patient-oriented and patient co-designed qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Indiscriminate use of laboratory blood testing in hospitals contributes to patient discomfort and healthcare waste. Patient engagement in low-value healthcare can help reduce overuse. Understanding patient experience is necessary to identify opportunities to improve patient engagement with in-hospital laboratory testing. OBJECTIVES: To understand patient experience with the process of in-hospital laboratory blood testing. METHODS: We used a qualitative study design via semistructured interviews conducted online or over the phone. Participants were adult patients or family members/caregivers (≥18 years of age) with a recent (within 12 months of interview) experience of hospitalization in Alberta or British Columbia, Canada. We identified participants through convenience sampling and conducted interviews between May 2021 and June 2022. We analysed transcripts using thematic content analysis. Recruitment was continued until code saturation was reached. RESULTS: We interviewed 16 participants (13 patients, 1 family member and 2 caregivers). We identified four themes from patients' experiences of in-hospital laboratory blood testing: (i) patients need information from healthcare teams about expected blood testing processes, (ii) blood draw processes should consider patient comfort and preferences, (iii) patients want information from their healthcare teams about the rationale and frequency of blood testing and (iv) patients need information on how their testing results affect their medical care. CONCLUSION: Current laboratory testing processes in hospitals do not facilitate shared decision-making and patient engagement. Patient engagement with laboratory testing in hospitals requires an empathetic healthcare team that provides clear communication regarding testing procedures, rationale and results, while considering patient preferences and offering opportunities for involvement. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: We interviewed 16 patients and/or family members/caregivers regarding their in-hospital laboratory blood testing experiences. Our findings show correlations between patient needs and patient recommendations to make testing processes more patient-centred. To bring a lived-experience lens to this study, we formed a Patient Advisory Council with 9-11 patient research partners. Our patient research partners informed the research design, co-developed participant recruitment strategies, co-conducted data collection and informed the data analysis. Some of our patient research partners are co-authors of this manuscript.",0
"Impact of Race, Ethnicity, Primary Language, and Insurance on Reconstruction after Mastectomy for Patients with Breast Cancer at an Urban, Academic Safety-Net Hospital.","BACKGROUND: Disparities in breast reconstruction have been observed in national cohorts and single-institution studies based on race, ethnicity, insurance, and language. However, little is known regarding whether safety-net hospitals deliver more or less equitable breast reconstruction care in comparison with national cohorts. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective study of patients with either invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ diagnosed and treated at our institution (January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2014). The rate of, timing of, and approach to breast reconstruction were assessed by race, ethnicity, insurance status, and primary language among women who underwent mastectomy. Reasons for not performing reconstruction were also analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 756 women with ductal carcinoma in situ or nonmetastatic invasive cancer were identified. The median age was 58.5 years, 56.2% were non-White, 33.1% were non-English-speaking, and 48.9% were Medicaid/uninsured patients. A total of 142 (18.8%) underwent mastectomy during their index operation. A total of 47.9% (n = 68) did not complete reconstruction. Reasons for not performing reconstruction included patient preference (n = 22), contraindication to immediate reconstruction (ie, locoregionally advanced disease prohibiting immediate reconstruction) without follow-up for consideration of delayed reconstruction (n = 12), prohibitive medical risk or contraindication (ie, morbid obesity; n = 8), and progression of disease, prohibiting reconstruction (n = 7). Immediate and delayed reconstruction were completed in 43.7% and 8.5% of patients. The rate of reconstruction was inversely associated with tumor stage (odds ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.88), but not race, ethnicity, insurance, or language, on multivariate regression. CONCLUSIONS: At a safety-net hospital, we observed rates of reconstruction at or greater than national estimates. After adjustment for clinical attributes, rates did not vary by race, ethnicity, insurance or language. Future research is needed to understand the role of reconstruction in breast cancer care and how to advance shared decision-making among diverse patients.",0
Patient's preference for sacrospinous hysteropexy or modified Manchester operation: A discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate women's preference for modified Manchester (MM) or sacrospinous hysteropexy (SH) as surgery for uterine prolapse. DESIGN: Labelled discrete choice experiment (DCE). SETTING: Eight Dutch hospitals. POPULATION: Women with uterine prolapse, eligible for primary surgery and preference for uterus preservation. METHODS: DCEs are attribute-based surveys. The two treatment options were labelled as MM and SH. Attributes in this survey were treatment success ( levels SH: 84%, 89%, 94%; levels MM: 89%, 93%, 96%), dyspareunia (levels: 0%, 5%, 10%), cervical stenosis (levels: 1%, 6%, 11%) and severe buttock pain (levels: 0%, 1%). A different combination of attribute levels was used in each choice set. Women completed nine choice sets, making a choice based on attribute levels. Data were analysed in multinomial logit models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women's preference for MM or SH. RESULTS: 137 DCEs were completed (1233 choice sets). SH was chosen in 49% of the choice sets, MM in 51%. Of all women, 39 (28%) always chose the same surgery. After exclusion of this group, 882 choice sets were analysed, in which women preferred MM, likely associated with a labelling effect, i.e. description of the procedure, rather than the tested attributes. In that group, MM was chosen in 53% of the choice sets and SH in 47%. When choosing MM, next to the label, dyspareunia was relevant for decision-making. For SH, all attributes were relevant for decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: The preference of women for MM or SH seems almost equally divided. The variety in preference supports the importance of individualised healthcare.",1
Intersectional race and gender disparities in kidney transplant access in the United States: a scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Gender and racial disparities in kidney transplant access are well established, however how gender and race interact to shape access to kidney transplant is less clear. Therefore, we examined existing literature to assess what is known about the potential interaction of gender and race and the impact on access to kidney transplantation in the US. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a scoping review and included quantitative and qualitative studies published in English between 1990 and May 31, 2023 among adult end-stage kidney disease patients in the US. All studies reported on access to specific transplant steps or perceived barriers to transplant access in gender and race subgroups, and the intersection between the two. We narratively synthesized findings across studies. RESULTS: Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria and included outcomes of referral (n = 4, 29%), evaluation (n = 2, 14%), waitlisting (n = 4, 29%), transplantation (n = 5, 36%), provider perceptions of patient transplant candidacy (n = 3, 21%), and patient preferences and requests for a living donor (n = 5, 36%). Overall, we found that White men have the greatest access at all steps of the transplant process, from referral to eventual living or deceased donor transplantation. In contrast, women from racial or ethnic minorities tend to have the lowest access to kidney transplant, in particular living donor transplant, though this was not consistent across all studies. CONCLUSIONS: Examining how racism and sexism interact to shape kidney transplant access should be investigated in future research, in order to ultimately shape policies and interventions to improve equity.",0
The application of discrete choice experiments eliciting young peoples' preferences for healthcare: a systematic literature review.,"OBJECTIVES: Understanding young people's preferences for healthcare is critical for reducing the negative effect of undesirable choices. This review aims to synthesise the evidence obtained from discrete choice experiments (DCEs) eliciting young people's preferences for healthcare interventions and service deliveries, specifically, to (1) examine the methodology, including a selection of attributes and levels, experimental design, estimation procedure and validity; (2) evaluate similarities, differences and rigour of designs to the general population DCEs; and, (3) compare the DCEs' application to the seven health priority areas defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO). METHODS: A systematic review searching Medline, EconLIT, PsychINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed up until May 2021. INCLUSION CRITERIA: a DCE, eliciting young peoples' preferences (10-24 years of age), on a healthcare-related topic defined by WHO, peer-reviewed, full-text available in English. A bespoke checklist was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. RESULTS: Eighteen DCE studies were included in the review, exploring interventions and service in sexual and reproductive health (n = 9; 50%), smoking cessation (n = 4; 22%), mental health (n = 1), nutrition (n = 1), unintentional injuries (n = 1), vaccination against severe but rare diseases (n = 1); and diabetes (n = 1). Compared to the general population, DCEs eliciting young people's preferences had a high proportion of monetary measures and a smaller number of choices per respondent with the overwhelming number of surveys using fractional factorial design. The majority of studies were of moderate quality (50-75% of the criteria met). CONCLUSIONS: While identified DCEs touched on most health priority areas, the scope was limited. The conduct and reporting of DCEs with young people could be improved by including the state-of-the-art design, estimation procedures and analysis.",1
"Completing the time trade-off with respondents who are older, in poorer health or with an immigrant background in an EQ-5D-5L valuation study.","OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of age, immigrant background, and poor self-reported health in a general population sample on the probability of non-completion or slow completion of the time trade-off (TTO). METHODS: We used data from an interrupted Norwegian EQ-5D-5L valuation study conducted between 2019 and 2020. All participants responded to background items, irrespective of completion. We used mixed effect logistic regression analysis to assess the effect of old age, poor health, and immigrant background on the probability of non-completion of the TTO, and, for those who completed the TTO, of slow completion times. RESULTS: First experiences from a Norwegian valuation study were that 29 (5.5%) respondents failed to complete the TTO tasks. For those reporting age over 65 years, poor health, or an immigrant background, 12% failed to complete the TTO. Adjusted odds ratios for predictors of non-completion were statistically significant (age > 65 years, 8.3; EQ-VAS ≤ 50, 3.49; immigrant background, 4.56). Being over 65 years or with an immigrant background also predicted slow completion of both the introduction and TTO tasks. CONCLUSIONS: High age, poor health, and immigrant status increased the risk of not being able to complete the TTO tasks, and of slow completion. Higher non-completion rates and increased completion times suggest that elements of the TTO may be demanding for some respondent groups, with possible implications for representativeness.",0
Do the Few Dictate Care for the Many? Revascularisation Considerations That Go Beyond the Guidelines.,"The burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) is large and growing, commonly presenting with comorbidities and older age. Patients may benefit from coronary revascularisation with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), yet half of patients with CAD who would benefit from revascularisation fall outside the eligibility criteria of trials to date. As such, the choice of revascularisation procedures varies depending on the CAD anatomy and complexity, surgical risk and comorbidities, the patient's preferences and values, and the treating team's expertise. The recent American guidelines on coronary revascularisation are comprehensive in describing recommendations for PCI, CABG, or conservative management in patients with CAD. However, individual challenging patient presentations cannot be fully captured in guidelines. The aim of this narrative review is to summarise common clinical scenarios that are not sufficiently described by contemporary clinical guidelines and trials in order to inform heart team members and trainees about the nuanced considerations and available evidence to manage such cases. We discuss clinical cases that fall beyond the current guidelines and summarise the relevant evidence evaluating coronary revascularisation for these patients. In addition, we highlight gaps in knowledge based on a lack of research (eg, ineligibility of certain patient populations), underrepresentation in research (eg, underenrollment of female and non-White patients), and the surge in newer minimally invasive and hybrid techniques. We argue that ultimately, evidence-based medicine, patient preference, shared decision making, and effective heart team communications are necessary to best manage complex CAD presentations potentially benefitting from revascularisation with CABG or PCI.",0
