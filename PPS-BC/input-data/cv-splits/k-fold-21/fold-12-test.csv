Development of a haemophilia A gene therapy shared decision-making tool for clinicians.,"INTRODUCTION: As gene therapies are incorporated into clinical practice, shared decision-making (SDM) is recommended for implementation. AIM: To inform development of a clinician SDM tool for haemophilia A gene therapy. METHODS: Clinicians at US Hemophilia Treatment Centers completed semi-structured interviews about their experience with SDM and provided feedback on a clinician SDM tool prototype. Interviews were transcribed verbatim for coding and thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Ten participants enrolled, eight physicians and two haemophilia nurses. All participants care for adults with haemophilia (1-27 years of experience) and 7 have gene therapy trials open at their institution. Confidence in having a clinical discussion about gene therapy included none (N = 1), slight (N = 3), moderate (N = 5) and high (N = 1). All participants reported familiarity with SDM and agreed that the tool would be useful for their clinical practice. Key themes in participant feedback for the tool were (1) language and presentation; (2) content; and (3) implementation. Participants highlighted the importance of providing unbiased information and having companion tools with patient-centric language. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the need for SDM tools for haemophilia A gene therapy. Key information to include in the tool are safety, efficacy, cost and detailed information on the gene therapy process. Data should be provided in an unbiased format and allow comparison to other treatments. The tool will be evaluated in clinical practice and refined as clinical trial data and real-world experience mature.",0
Attributing practice variation by its sources: the case of varicose veins treatments in the Netherlands.,"BACKGROUND: Unwarranted practice variation refers to regional differences in treatments that are not driven by patients' medical needs or preferences. Although it is the subject of numerous studies, most research focuses on variation at the end stage of treatment, i.e. the stage of the treating specialist, disregarding variation stemming from other sources (e.g. patient preferences, general practitioner referral patterns). In the present paper, we introduce a method that allows us to measure regional variation at different stages of the patient journey leading up to treatment. METHODS: A series of logit regressions estimating the probability of (1) initial visit with the physician and (2) treatment correcting for patient needs and patient preferences. Calculating the coefficient of variation (CVU) at each stage of the patient journey. RESULTS: Our findings show large regional variations in the probability of receiving an initial visit, The CVU, or the measure of dispersion, in the regional probability of an initial visit with a specialist was significantly larger (0.87-0.96) than at the point of treatment both conditional (0.14-0.25) and unconditional on an initial visit (0.65-0.74), suggesting that practice variation was present before the patient reached the specialist. CONCLUSIONS: We present a new approach to attribute practice variation to different stages in the patient journey. We demonstrate our method using the clinically-relevant segment of varicose veins treatments. Our findings demonstrate that irrespective of the gatekeeping role of general practitioners (GPs), a large share of practice variation in the treatment of varicose veins is attributable to regional variation in primary care referrals. Contrary to expectation, specialists' decisions meaningfully diminish rather than increase the amount of regional variation.",0
Defect-Oriented Versus Back Scar-Oriented Flap Design in Breast Reconstruction with Latissimus Dorsi Musculocutaneous Flap: A Patient-Reported Satisfaction Outcome Comparison Using BREAST-Q.,"BACKGROUND: The design of the latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap in breast reconstruction has several options. To date, there have been no reports on the surgical outcomes with flap designed based on the defect shape of the mastectomy site and flap shape of the donor site. To compare patient satisfaction according to the flap design, we designed and conducted independent three sub-studies targeting fifty-three breast reconstruction patients using BREAST-Q(©) scale. METHODS: In study 1, there was no difference in patient satisfaction between the group with the flap designed according to the shape of mastectomy defect (defect-oriented group) that with the flap designed according to patient's wish regardless of defect shape (back scar-oriented group). In study 2, comparing the results based on the shape of the flap, vertically designed flap showed a statistically significant difference in the psychosocial well-being. In study 3, comparing the results based on the shape of the defect, no significant difference was noted. RESULTS: Even though designing a donor flap based on the shape and orientation of the mastectomy defect has no statistical significance in patient satisfaction or quality of life compared with that based on the patient preference in placement of the donor site scar, the group with the vertical donor design showed better psychosocial well-being than the group with other shapes of the donor flap. By considering the advantages and disadvantages of each flap design, enhanced patient satisfaction and durability and natural aesthetic goal can be achieved. This is the first study to compare the differences in results according to the flap design method during breast reconstruction. Patient satisfaction according to the design of the flap was investigated in the form of a questionnaire survey, and the results were displayed. In addition to breast shape, donor scars and complications were also investigated. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Use of the Allium Round Posterior Stent for the Treatment of Recurrent Vesicourethral Anastomosis Stricture.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes of monopolar incision and Allium Round Posterior Stent (RPS) insertion for the treatment of recurrent vesicourethral anastomosis stricture. METHODS: Having a suprapubic catheter and an obstructed pattern with a peak flow rate (PFR) ≤12 mL/s on uroflowmetry were the indications for the surgery. Once the fibrotic vesicourethral anastomosis was incised, RPS was inserted at the level of vesicourethral anastomosis under fluoroscopic guidance. All the stents were removed at postoperative first year. Patients were evaluated 3months after stent removal. Objective cure was defined as no need to further treatments and PFR ≥12 mL/s while subjective cure was defined as having points <4 on Patient Global Impression of Improvements scale. RESULTS: Of the 30 patients with a median age 66 (52-74) enrolled in the study, 18 had a suprapubic catheter, remaining 12 had median PFR 5.2 (2-10) mL/s. Stent migration was noted in two patients, these stents were replaced by new ones. Stone formation was diagnosed in one patient, a pneumatic-lithotripsy was performed. The median follow-up time was 28 (4-60) months following stent removal. Six cases needed further treatment after removal. The median PFR of remaining 24 patients was 20 (16-30) mL/s (P = .001). The objective cure rate was 24/30(80%), the Patient Global Impression of Improvements scores varied from 1 to 2, meaning subjective cure rate was 24/30(80%). For the six failed cases, according to patient preferences a lifetime RPS insertion was planned. CONCLUSION: With its minimally invasive nature, reversibility, and acceptable success and complication rates, incision of anastomosis and insertion of the RPS for a 1-year duration is a promising option for the treatment of recurrent vesicourethral anastomosis stricture.",0
Hospital doctors' and general practitioners' perspectives of outpatient discharge processes in Australia: an interpretive approach.,"BACKGROUND: Unnecessary delays in patient discharge from hospital outpatient clinics have direct consequences for timely access of new patients and the length of outpatient waiting times. The aim of this study was to gain better understanding of hospital doctors' and general practitioners' perspectives of the barriers and facilitators when discharging from hospital outpatients to general practice. METHODS: An interpretative approach incorporating semi-structured interviews with 15 participants enabled both hospital doctors and general practitioners to give their perspectives on hospital outpatient discharge processes. RESULTS: Participants mentioned various system problems hampering discharge from hospital outpatient clinics to general practice, such as limitations of electronic communication tools, workforce and workload challenges, the absence of agreed discharge principles, and lack of benchmark data. Hospital clinicians may keep patients under their care out of a concern about lack of follow-up and an inability to escalate timely hospital care following discharge. Some hospital clinicians may have a personal preference to provide ongoing care in the outpatient setting. Other factors mentioned were insufficient supervision of junior doctors, a patient preference to remain under hospital care, and the ease of scheduling follow-up appointments. An effective handover process requires protected time, a systematic approach, and a supportive clinical environment including user-friendly electronic communication and clinical handover tools. Several system improvements and models of care were suggested, such as agreed discharge processes, co-designed between hospitals and general practice. Recording and sharing outpatient discharge data may assist to inform and motivate hospital clinicians and support the training of junior doctors. General practitioners participating in the study were prepared to provide continuation of care but require timely clinical management plans that can be applied in the community setting. A hospital re-entry pathway providing rapid access to outpatient hospital resources after discharge could act as a safety net and may be an alternative to the standard 12-month review in hospital outpatient clinics. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the barriers to discharge as mentioned in the literature and adds the perspectives of both hospital clinicians and general practitioners. Potential solutions were suggested including co-designed discharge policies, improved electronic communication tools and a rapid hospital review pathway following discharge.",0
Impact of Telemedicine Modality on Quality Metrics in Diverse Settings: Implementation Science-Informed Retrospective Cohort Study.,"BACKGROUND: Video-based telemedicine (vs audio only) is less frequently used in diverse, low socioeconomic status settings. Few prior studies have evaluated the impact of telemedicine modality (ie, video vs audio-only visits) on clinical quality metrics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess telemedicine uptake and impact of visit modality (in-person vs video and phone visits) on primary care quality metrics in diverse, low socioeconomic status settings through an implementation science lens. METHODS: Informed by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework, we evaluated telemedicine uptake, assessed targeted primary care quality metrics by visit modality, and described provider-level qualitative feedback on barriers and facilitators to telemedicine implementation. RESULTS: We found marginally better quality metrics (ie, blood pressure and depression screening) for in-person care versus video and phone visits; de-adoption of telemedicine was marked within 2 years in our population. CONCLUSIONS: Following the widespread implementation of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of visit modality on quality outcomes, provider and patient preferences, as well as technological barriers in historically marginalized settings should be considered.",0
A real-world retrospective single-centre study of the cost-effectiveness and long-term outcomes of pegylated interferon for chronic hepatitis B.,"BACKGROUND: Pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) is recommended as first-line therapy for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) but has significant side effects and is rarely used compared to oral nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA). There are limited recent clinical efficacy or economic analysis data comparing approved CHB therapy in North America. METHODS: This retrospective study examined clinical outcomes, off-treatment durability, and cost-effectiveness of Peg-IFN versus NA for CHB. Demographic (age, sex, ethnicity), clinical data (i.e., liver tests, hepatitis B virus DNA, serology, transient elastography) and documented side effects were collected by retrospective chart review of patients followed in the University of Calgary Liver Unit who received Peg-IFN therapy from January 2007 to December 2020. The cost-effectiveness of Peg-IFN versus NA therapy was modelled over a 10-year time horizon. RESULTS: Sixty-eight CHB patients were treated with Peg-IFN (median age 45.65, 74% male, 84% Asian); 50/68 (74%) completed 48 weeks of treatment with a median follow-up of 6.54 years (interquartile range 5.07). At the last known follow-up, 23/68 (34%) have not required NA treatment and one had HBsAg loss; 27 have been started on NA. Predictors of obtaining a sustained virological response included being hepatitis B e antigen-negative at treatment end and a quantitative hepatitis B surface antigen <1000 IU/mL. Economic modelling showed that finite Peg-IFN was not cost-effective versus NA at a 10-year time horizon. CONCLUSIONS: PEG-IFN remains a potential treatment for CHB although there is a significant intolerance/failure rate. Using PEG-IFN based on patient preference is reasonable and optimal patient selection may improve treatment cost-effectiveness.",0
The 2022 Updated European Association of Urology Guidelines on the Use of Adjuvant Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy for Renal Cell Carcinoma.,"In KEYNOTE-564, adjuvant pembrolizumab, a PD-1 antibody, significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) in localised clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) with a high risk of relapse. In 2021, the European Association of Urology RCC Guidelines Panel issued a weak recommendation for adjuvant pembrolizumab for high-risk ccRCC as defined by the trial until final overall survival data and results from other trials were available. Meanwhile, the primary DFS endpoints were not met for adjuvant atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor; IMmotion010), adjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab (CheckMate 914), or perioperative nivolumab (PROSPER). Owing to heterogeneity, a meta-analysis is not recommended. Pembrolizumab remains the only immune checkpoint inhibitor currently recommended in this setting. Overall survival data are immature and biomarkers to predict outcome are lacking. Uncertainty exists and overtreatment is occurring. Treatment decisions should be made with caution and with the involvement of each patient. PATIENT SUMMARY: New results from three trials of immunotherapy after surgery for kidney cancer to reduce the risk of recurrence showed no improvement with these treatments. These results are in contrast to an earlier study that showed that the antibody pembrolizumab did extend the time before kidney cancer recurrence, even though it is not yet clear if overall survival is longer. Thus, we cautiously recommend pembrolizumab as additional treatment in high-risk kidney cancer after surgery, but patient preference should be carefully considered and the risk of overtreatment should be discussed.",0
A practical proposal on treatment sequencing of metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours.,"According to the neuroendocrine tumour (NET) characteristics, 3 to 7 different treatment options are available, corresponding to 6 to 5,040 theoretical different sequences. Even though each patient is unique and despite a large heterogeneity in NET characteristics, the present review aims to discuss the main sequences and addresses how one can propose the best sequence to treat metastatic NET (mNET) on a case-by-case basis. Each treatment must be discussed during dedicated multi-disciplinary meetings, and inclusions in clinical trials should be favoured. After a thorough characterization of patients and their mNET, and taking into account the availability of drugs, the first-line treatment should be chosen according to the treatment aim. The latter is determined based on three main topics (efficacy, safety, and patient preferences) that do not necessarily converge and must be defined a priori. At baseline, physicians should design an a priori full therapeutic sequence, which may evolve at each step depending on the response to previous treatment, the occurrence of chronic toxicities, and the patients' perception of the prior treatment. To improve knowledge in terms of effectiveness and risk of cumulative toxicities regarding the different sequences, real-world data using long follow-up durations are necessary; such issues will not be resolved by randomized clinical trials.",0
A Narrative Review of Advancements in Understanding and Treating Varicose Veins.,"Chronic venous disease, with varicose veins as its archetypal manifestation, stands as a pervasive and intricate health quandary, encompassing a vast array of contributing factors. Age, genetics, obesity, pregnancy, and prolonged immobility weave a complex tapestry, underscoring the omnipresence of this ailment. Its societal and economic footprint is undeniably formidable, as diverse classifications underscore its multifaceted character. The intricate interplay of chronic venous disease with diabetes mellitus and neuropathy compounds the challenge, fostering soaring healthcare expenditures and a palpable erosion of quality of life, particularly among women harboring cardiometabolic risk factors. Despite research shedding light on heightened susceptibility within certain demographics, the enigmatic determinants orchestrating the transition from mild to severe chronic venous disease continue to elude us. Varicose veins, marked by the presence of dilated and tortuous subcutaneous vessels, precipitate both physical discomfort and cosmetic concerns, frequently necessitating meticulous clinical evaluation coupled with ultrasound studies to secure a precise diagnosis. Treatment strategies are strategically crafted to ameliorate distressing symptoms, enhance aesthetic concerns, and forestall potential complications. Nevertheless, the prognostication of chronic venous disease remains ensconced in a degree of ambiguity, hinting at the vast terrain yet to be charted in this medical domain. The quest to fathom the intricacies of this condition uncovers an ever-evolving panorama where conservative interventions play an indispensable role in managing mild cases, while interventional procedures like endovenous laser ablation and sclerotherapy step onto the stage for patients grappling with severe symptoms, thus treading the fine line between efficacy and invasiveness. Moreover, a meticulous economic analysis underscores the cost-effectiveness of various therapeutic modalities, thereby bolstering the imperative of a patient-centered approach. As we navigate the labyrinthine complexities of chronic venous disease and varicose vein management, we are inexorably drawn to the pivotal role of customized treatment approaches, as well as the dynamic interplay between scientific progress, patient preferences, and therapeutic innovations in the relentless pursuit of optimized outcomes and an enhanced quality of life.",0
It takes more than a machine: A pilot feasibility study of point-of-care HIV-1 viral load testing at a lower-level health center in rural western Uganda.,"Barriers continue to limit access to viral load (VL) monitoring across sub-Saharan Africa adversely impacting control of the HIV epidemic. The objective of this study was to determine whether the systems and processes required to realize the potential of rapid molecular technology are available at a prototypical lower-level (i.e., level III) health center in rural Uganda. In this open-label pilot study, participants underwent parallel VL testing at both the central laboratory (i.e., standard of care) and on-site using the GeneXpert HIV-1 assay. The primary outcome was the number of VL tests completed each clinic day. Secondary outcomes included the number of days from sample collection to receipt of result at clinic and the number of days from sample collection to patient receipt of the result. From August 2020 to July 2021, we enrolled a total of 242 participants. The median number of daily tests performed on the Xpert platform was 4, (IQR = 2-7). Time from sample collection to result was 51 days (IQR = 45-62) for samples sent to the central laboratory and 0 days (IQR = 0-0.25) for the Xpert assay conducted at the health center. However, few participants elected to receive results by one of the expedited options, which contributed to similar time-to-patient between testing approaches (89 versus 84 days, p = 0.07). Implementation of a rapid, near point-of-care VL assay at a lower-level health center in rural Uganda appears feasible, but interventions to promote rapid clinical response and influence patient preferences about result receipt require further study.

Comparing the Long-Term Success Rates of Tooth Preservation and Dental Implants: A Critical Review.,"Implant therapy is considered a predictable, safe, and reliable rehabilitation method for edentulous patients in most clinical scenarios. Thus, there is a growing trend in the indications for implants, which seems attributable not only to their clinical success but also to arguments such as a more ""simplified approach"" based on convenience or the belief that dental implants are as good as natural teeth. Therefore, the objective of this critical literature review of observational studies was to discuss the evidence concerning the long-term survival rates and treatment outcomes, comparing endodontically or periodontally treated teeth with dental implants. Altogether, the evidence suggests that the decision between keeping a tooth or replacing it with an implant should carefully consider the condition of the tooth (e.g., amount of remaining tooth and degree of attachment loss and mobility), systemic disorders, and patient preference. Although observational studies revealed high success rates and long-term survival of dental implants, failures and complications are common. For this reason, attempts should be made to first save maintainable teeth over the long-term, instead of immediately replacing teeth with dental implants.",0
Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy for the Treatment of Primary and Metastatic Brain Tumors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a minimally invasive treatment option for intracranial tumors that are challenging to treat via traditional methods; however, its safety and efficacy are not yet well validated in the literature. The objectives of the study were to assess the available evidence of the indications and adverse events (AEs) of LITT and 1-year progression-free survival and 1-year overall survival in the treatment of primary and secondary brain tumors. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted through the databases PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library until October 2021. Comparative and descriptive studies, except for case reports, were included in the meta-analysis. Separate analyses by tumor type (high-grade gliomas, including World Health Organization grade 4 astrocytomas [which include glioblastomas] as a specific subgroup; low-grade gliomas; and brain metastases) were conducted. Pooled effect sizes and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were generated via random-effects models. RESULTS: Forty-five studies met the inclusion criteria, yielding 826 patients for meta-analysis. There were 829 lesions in total, of which 361 were classified as high-grade gliomas, 116 as low-grade gliomas, 337 as metastatic brain tumors, and 15 as nonglial tumors. Indications for offering LITT included deep/inaccessible tumor (12 studies), salvage therapy after failed radiosurgery (9), failures of ≥2 treatment options (3), in pediatric patients (4), patient preference (1); indications were nonspecific in 12 studies. Pooled incidence of all (minor or major) procedure-related AEs was 30% (95% CI, 27%-40%) for all tumors. Pooled incidence of neurologic deficits (minor or major) was 16% (12%-22%); postprocedural edema 14% (8%-22%); seizure 6% (4%-9%); hematoma 20% (14%-29%); deep vein thrombosis 19% (11%-30%); hydrocephalus 8% (5%-12%); and wound infection 5% (3%-7%). One-year progression-free survival was 18.6% (11.3%-29.0%) in high-grade gliomas, 16.9% (11.6%-24.0%) among the grade 4 astrocytomas; and 51.2% (36.7%-65.5%) in brain metastases. One-year overall survival was 43.0% (36.0%-50.0%) in high-grade glioma, 45.9% (95% CI, 37.9%-54%) in grade 4 astrocytomas; 93.0% (42.3%-100%) in low-grade gliomas, and 56.3% (47.0%-65.3%) in brain metastases. CONCLUSIONS: New neurologic deficits and postprocedural edema were the most reported AEs after LITT, albeit mostly transient. This meta-analysis provides the best statistical estimates of progression and survival outcomes based on the available information. LITT is generally a safe procedure for selected patients, and future well-designed comparative studies on its outcomes versus the current standard of care should be performed.",0
Patient preferences and cost-benefit of hypertension and hyperlipidemia collaborative management model between pharmacies and primary care in Portugal: A discrete choice experiment alongside a trial (USFarmácia®).,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about patient preferences and the value of pharmacy-collaborative disease management with primary care using technology-driven interprofessional communication under real-world conditions. Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) are useful for quantifying preferences for non-market services. OBJECTIVES: 1) To explore variation in patient preferences and estimate willingness-to-accept annual cost to the National Health Service (NHS) for attributes of a collaborative intervention trial between pharmacies and primary care using a trial exit DCE interview; 2) to incorporate a DCE into an economic evaluation using cost-benefit analysis (CBA). METHODS: We performed a DCE telephone interview with a sample of hypertension and hyperlipidemia trial patients 12 months after trial onset. We used five attributes (levels): waiting time to get urgent/not urgent medical appointment (7 days/45 days; 48 hrs./30 days; same day/15 days), model of pharmacy intervention (5-min. counter basic check; 15-min. office every 3 months for BP and medication review of selected medicines; 30-min. office every 6 months for comprehensive measurements and medication review of all medicines), integration with primary care (weak; partial; full), chance of having a stroke in 5 years (same; slightly lower; much lower), and annual cost to the NHS (0€; 30€; 51€; 76€). We used an experimental orthogonal fractional factorial design. Data were analyzed using conditional logit. We subtracted the estimated annual incremental trial costs from the mean WTA (Net Benefit) for CBA. RESULTS: A total of 122 patients completed the survey. Waiting time to get medical appointment-on the same day (urgent) and within 15 days (non-urgent)-was the most important attribute, followed by 30-minute pharmacy intervention in private office every 6 months for point-of-care measurements and medication review of all medicines, and full integration with primary care. The cost attribute was not significant. Intervention patients were willing to accept the NHS annual cost of €877 for their preferred scenario. The annual net benefit per patient is €788.20 and represents the monetary value of patients' welfare surplus for this model. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first conducted in Portugal alongside a pharmacy collaborative trial, incorporating DCE into CBA. The findings can be used to guide the design of pharmacy collaborative interventions with primary care with the potential for reimbursement for uncontrolled or at-risk chronic disease patients informed by patient preferences. Future DCE studies conducted in community pharmacy may provide additional contributions.

Avelumab treatment for patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma can be safely stopped after 1 year and a PET/CT-confirmed complete response.,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) has shown high response rates, ranging from 33% to 73%. The ideal duration of treatment, however, is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate if avelumab treatment for mMCC can be safely stopped after 1 year of treatment and a complete response (CR) confirmed by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) imaging. METHODS: Patients who received more than one dose of avelumab treatment for mMCC between November 2017 and February 2022 were included in this study. Treatment was discontinued in case of a FDG-PET/CT confirmed CR after 1 year (26 cycles) of avelumab or a CR and unacceptable toxicity earlier. The primary end point was recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were included: 25 (38%) had a FDG-PET/CT-confirmed CR at discontinuation of avelumab. In those 25 patients, reasons for discontinuation of treatment were completion of 1 year of treatment in 13 (52%), toxicity in five (20%), and patient preference in seven (28%). Median duration of treatment in this group was 11 months (interquartile range, 6.1-11.7). Median follow-up was 27 months (interquartile range, 15.8-33.8). The 12-month RFS was 88% (95% CI, 0.74-1) and median RFS was not reached. Two patients (8%) had a recurrence at 4 and 7 months after discontinuation of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mMCC who acquire a CR on PET/CT imaging appear to have durable responses after discontinuation of treatment after 1 year.",0
Functional status and therapy for older adults with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in nursing homes: A population-based study.,"OBJECTIVES: To characterize the prevalence of functional and cognitive impairments, and associations between impairments and treatment among older patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) receiving nursing home (NH) care. METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database to identify beneficiaries diagnosed with DLBCL 2011-2015 who received care in a NH within -120 ~ +30 days of diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare receipt of chemoimmunotherapy (including multi-agent, anthracycline-containing regimens), 30-day mortality, and hospitalization between NH and community-dwelling patients, estimating odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). We also examined overall survival (OS). Among NH patients, we examined receipt of chemoimmunotherapy based on functional and cognitive impairment. RESULTS: Of the eligible 649 NH patients (median age: 82 years), 45% received chemoimmunotherapy; among the recipients, 47% received multi-agent, anthracycline-containing regimens. Compared with community-dwelling patients, those in a NH were less likely to receive chemoimmunotherapy (OR: 0.34, 95%CI: 0.29-0.41), had higher 30-day mortality (OR: 2.00, 95%CI: 1.43-2.78) and hospitalization (OR: 1.51, 95%CI: 1.18-1.93), and poorer OS (hazard ratio: 1.36, 95%CI: 1.11-1.65). NH patients with severe functional (61%) or any cognitive impairment (48%) were less likely to receive chemoimmunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: High rates of functional and cognitive impairment and low rates of chemoimmunotherapy were observed among NH residents diagnosed with DLBCL. Further research is needed to better understand the potential role of novel and alternative treatment strategies and patient preferences for treatment to optimize clinical care and outcomes in this high-risk population.",0
Understanding community-dwelling older adults' preferences for home- and community-based services: A conjoint analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Older adults' preference for home- and community-based service programs has been highlighted as an essential but usually ignored ingredient in current care models. Disentangling how preferences contribute to older adults' decision-making could facilitate finding optimal ways to deliver home- and community-based services in times of increasing scarcity. OBJECTIVE: To identify Chinese community-dwelling older adults' preference structure for home- and community-based services and thus to optimize service provision. METHODS: Conjoint analysis, a preference-based technique, was employed to study older adults' preferences. A stepwise qualitative approach was first adopted to identify the attributes and attribute levels of home- and community-based services. Scenarios were defined through an orthogonal fractional factorial design, and a cross-sectional survey was conducted through a face-to-face, anonymous questionnaire. Conjoint analysis was performed to determine preference weights representing the relative importance of the identified attributes, and cluster analysis was performed to identify clusters of participants with similar preference structures. All data analyses were performed using SAS v9.4 and SPSS 22.0. RESULTS: A total of 321 of 350 invited participants completed the questionnaire. Four attributes were identified and used to create the conjoint scenarios: care-giving attitude, price, technical care-giving skills, and the type of service provider. Care-giving attitude was the most valued attribute for older adults when making decisions (relative importance score = 48.28), followed by price (relative importance score = 21.618), technical care-giving skills (relative importance score = 19.518), and finally, the type of service provider (relative importance score = 10.585). Three preference phenotypes were identified by applying cluster analysis: ""price-oriented"", ""comprehensively balanced"", and ""attitude-oriented"". CONCLUSION: The present study underscored the importance of considering attributes valued by Chinese older adults in the design and delivery of home- and community-based services. The preference structure, including the utility score of the attribute levels, differs among older adults. The findings could inform future research and practice and suggest incorporating flexibility during the service delivery stage.",1
Discharge of Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients on Sub-Optimal Dual Anti-Platelet Therapy: A Single Center Experience.,"PURPOSE: To identify and quantify the reasons why acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing stenting at University of New Mexico Hospital were prescribed sub-optimal dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) at discharge, and to identify practice patterns that could potentially lead to improved DAPT treatment for these patients. METHODS: We reviewed electronic medical records and cardiac catheterization records of 326 patients who underwent PCI at UNMH between January 1, 2021, and June 30, 2022 and identified 229 ACS patients who survived until discharge. Demographic and clinical characteristics relevant to P2Y(12) selection were obtained from a review of medical records. Pharmacists' notes that documented their efforts to get appropriate insurance coverage and reasons for discharge on clopidogrel rather than ticagrelor were reviewed. Patients discharged on aspirin and clopidogrel underwent review of medical records and cardiac catheterization lab records to determine if the discharge P2Y(12) drug was appropriate. Reasons for inappropriately discharge on clopidogrel were categorized as cost/insurance, patient preference, concern for daily adherence to a twice-daily medication, and on clopidogrel before PCI and not switched to ticagrelor afterward. RESULTS: The 229 ACS patients included (38.0%, n = 87) appropriately discharged on ticagrelor/prasugrel, (27.5%, n = 63) appropriately discharged on clopidogrel, (32.8%, n = 75) inappropriately discharged on clopidogrel, and (1.7%, n = 4) not discharged on a P2Y(12) inhibitor. For patients inappropriately discharged on clopidogrel (n = 75), the most common reasons were cost or lack of insurance (n = 56) and clinical inertia (taking clopidogrel before PCI and maintained on it afterward) (n = 17). Inappropriate DAPT at discharge correlated with lack of insurance (90.5% compared to 39.7% in patients with insurance, P < 0.001) but not with ethnicity. CONCLUSION: At the University of New Mexico, a safety-net hospital, increasing financially restricted access to ticagrelor could help up to 24.5% of ACS patients reduce their risk of ischemic events. For patients admitted on clopidogrel DAPT, upgrading to ticagrelor could reduce ischemic risk in 7.4% of ACS patients. Expanding healthcare insurance coverage might redue sub-optimal DAPT coverage.",0
Understanding and preventing nonadherence and treatment dropout in adolescents and young adults with anxiety and depressive disorders.,"Dropout from psychological or pharmacological treatment for anxiety and depressive disorders is common. It is especially problematic in adolescents and young adults because of the adverse consequences for their development. Reasons for treatment dropout can be divided into therapy-process related factors, attitudinal aspects, and practical issues. Adjusting treatment to patient preferences and shared decision making, improving the therapeutic alliance, and interventions such as (family) psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, and help with practical issues are promising strategies to optimize engagement and adherence.",0
Patient preferences for active ulcerative colitis treatments and fecal microbiota transplantation.,"BACKGROUND: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising treatment for active ulcerative colitis (UC). Understanding patient preferences can identify treatment features that may impact treatment decisions, improve shared decision-making, and contribute to patient-centered care, which is especially important in the context of novel treatments like FMT. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to quantify preferences for active UC treatments, specifically FMT and biologics, and identify patient characteristics associated with different preference patterns. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional survey study. METHODS: We administered a discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey to elicit preferences in a sample of Canadian adults with UC. DCE data were analyzed using a main-effects mixed logit model and used to predict uptake of hypothetical scenarios reflecting alternative combinations of treatment features. Latent class modeling identified heterogeneity in patient preference patterns. RESULTS: Participants' (n = 201) mean age was 47.1 years (SD: 14.5 years), 58% were female, and most (84%) had at least some post-secondary education. Almost half were willing to undergo FMT. When considering treatments for active UC, the most important attributes were chance of remission and severity of rare unknown side effects. All else equal, participants were most likely to uptake treatment that involves oral capsules/pills. Participants in the class with the highest utility for chance of remission were younger, had more severe disease, and 58% indicated that they would be willing to undergo FMT. CONCLUSION: We identified characteristics of UC patients who are more likely to be interested in FMT using preference elicitation methods. Patient-centered care can be enhanced by knowing which patients are more likely to be interested in FMT, potentially improving satisfaction with and adherence to treatments for active UC to maximize the effectiveness of treatment while considering heterogeneity in patient preferences.",1
2022 Joint ESC/EACTS review of the 2018 guideline recommendations on the revascularization of left main coronary artery disease in patients at low surgical risk and anatomy suitable for PCI or CABG.,"In October 2021, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) jointly agreed to establish a Task Force (TF) to review recommendations of the 2018 ESC/EACTS Guidelines on myocardial revascularization as they apply to patients with left main (LM) disease with low-to-intermediate SYNTAX score (0-32). This followed the withdrawal of support by the EACTS in 2019 for the recommendations about the management of LM disease of the previous guideline. The TF was asked to review all new relevant data since the 2018 guidelines including updated aggregated data from the four randomized trials comparing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents vs. coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with LM disease. This document represents a summary of the work of the TF; suggested updated recommendations for the choice of revascularization modality in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization for LM disease are included. In stable patients with an indication for revascularization for LM disease, with coronary anatomy suitable for both procedures and a low predicted surgical mortality, the TF concludes that both treatment options are clinically reasonable based on patient preference, available expertise, and local operator volumes. The suggested recommendations for revascularization with CABG are Class I, Level of Evidence A. The recommendations for PCI are Class IIa, Level of Evidence A. The TF recognized several important gaps in knowledge related to revascularization in patients with LM disease and recognizes that aggregated data from the four randomized trials were still only large enough to exclude large differences in mortality.",0
Merging machine learning and patient preference: a novel tool for risk prediction of percutaneous coronary interventions.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Predicting personalized risk for adverse events following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains critical in weighing treatment options, employing risk mitigation strategies, and enhancing shared decision-making. This study aimed to employ machine learning models using pre-procedural variables to accurately predict common post-PCI complications. METHODS: A group of 66 adults underwent a semiquantitative survey assessing a preferred list of outcomes and model display. The machine learning cohort included 107 793 patients undergoing PCI procedures performed at 48 hospitals in Michigan between 1 April 2018 and 31 December 2021 in the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Cardiovascular Consortium (BMC2) registry separated into training and validation cohorts. External validation was conducted in the Cardiac Care Outcomes Assessment Program database of 56 583 procedures in 33 hospitals in Washington. RESULTS: Overall rate of in-hospital mortality was 1.85% (n = 1999), acute kidney injury 2.51% (n = 2519), new-onset dialysis 0.44% (n = 462), stroke 0.41% (n = 447), major bleeding 0.89% (n = 942), and transfusion 2.41% (n = 2592). The model demonstrated robust discrimination and calibration for mortality {area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.930 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.920-0.940]}, acute kidney injury [AUC: 0.893 (95% CI 0.883-0.903)], dialysis [AUC: 0.951 (95% CI 0.939-0.964)], stroke [AUC: 0.751 (95%CI 0.714-0.787)], transfusion [AUC: 0.917 (95% CI 0.907-0.925)], and major bleeding [AUC: 0.887 (95% CI 0.870-0.905)]. Similar discrimination was noted in the external validation population. Survey subjects preferred a comprehensive list of individually reported post-procedure outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Using common pre-procedural risk factors, the BMC2 machine learning models accurately predict post-PCI outcomes. Utilizing patient feedback, the BMC2 models employ a patient-centred tool to clearly display risks to patients and providers (https://shiny.bmc2.org/pci-prediction/). Enhanced risk prediction prior to PCI could help inform treatment selection and shared decision-making discussions.",0

Advancing precision oncology through systematic germline and tumor genetic analysis: The oncogenetic point of view on findings from a prospective multicenter clinical trial of 666 patients.,"INTRODUCTION: With the emergence of targeted therapies, there is a need to accurately identify more tumor biomarkers. The EXOMA trial was designed to offer tumor and germline exome sequencing (ES) to patients with solid malignant tumors and facing therapeutic failure. As hereditary cancer predispositions could be identified, with genetic counseling and health management implications, a genetic consultation was systematically established. This design needs to be discussed as genetic human resources are limited and indication of theranostic tests will increase. METHODS: Genetic counseling was conducted within 15 days following inclusion in the study for patients recruited between December 2015 and July 2019. In silico analyses from theranostic ES were limited to 317 genes involved in oncogenesis, from both tumor and blood DNA. RESULTS: Six hundred and sixty six patients had a genetic consultation before ES. In 65/666 patients, 66 germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants were identified in 16 actionable genes and seven non-actionable genes according to French guidelines. 24/65 patients had previously received genetic analysis for diagnostic purposes, and for 17 of them, a P/LP variant had already been identified. Among the 48/65 remaining cases for which the EXOMA protocol revealed a previously unknown P/LP variant, only 19 met the criteria for genetic testing for inherited cancer risk after familial survey. These criteria had not been identified by the oncologist in 10 cases. In 21/65 cases, the variant was considered incidental. DISCUSSION: In 7.4% of patients, an undiagnosed hereditary genetic predisposition was identified, whether or not related to the clinical presentation, and germline analysis impacted oncological management for only 6.3% of the cohort. This low percentage should be weighed against the burden of systematic genetic consultation and urgent circuits. Information or training tools to form oncologists to the prescription of germline genetic analyses should be explored, as well as information supports and patient preferences.",0
Patient preference for second- and third-line therapies in type 2 diabetes: a prespecified secondary endpoint of the TriMaster study.,"Patient preference is very important for medication selection in chronic medical conditions, like type 2 diabetes, where there are many different drugs available. Patient preference balances potential efficacy with potential side effects. As both aspects of drug response can vary markedly between individuals, this decision could be informed by the patient personally experiencing the alternative medications, as occurs in a crossover trial. In the TriMaster (NCT02653209, ISRCTN12039221), randomized double-blind, three-way crossover trial patients received three different second- or third-line once-daily type 2 diabetes glucose-lowering drugs (pioglitazone 30 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg and canagliflozin 100 mg). As part of a prespecified secondary endpoint, we examined patients' drug preference after they had tried all three drugs. In total, 448 participants were treated with all three drugs which overall showed similar glycemic control (HbA1c on pioglitazone 59.5 sitagliptin 59.9, canagliflozin 60.5 mmol mol(-1), P = 0.19). In total, 115 patients (25%) preferred pioglitazone, 158 patients (35%) sitagliptin and 175 patients (38%) canagliflozin. The drug preferred by individual patients was associated with a lower HbA1c (mean: 4.6; 95% CI: 3.9, 5.3) mmol mol(-1) lower versus nonpreferred) and fewer side effects (mean: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.64) fewer side effects versus nonpreferred). Allocating therapy based on the individually preferred drugs, rather than allocating all patients the overall most preferred drug (canagliflozin), would result in more patients achieving the lowest HbA1c for them (70% versus 30%) and the fewest side effects (67% versus 50%). When precision approaches do not predict a clear optimal therapy for an individual, allowing patients to try potential suitable medications before they choose long-term therapy could be a practical alternative to optimizing treatment for type 2 diabetes.",0
"Which symptom to address in psychological treatment for cancer survivors when fear of cancer recurrence, depressive symptoms, and cancer-related fatigue co-occur? Exploring the level of agreement between three systematic approaches to select the focus of ","PURPOSE: To investigate the extent to which three systematic approaches for prioritizing symptoms lead to similar treatment advices in cancer survivors with co-occurring fear of cancer recurrence, depressive symptoms, and/or cancer-related fatigue. METHODS: Psychological treatment advices were was based on three approaches: patient preference, symptom severity, and temporal precedence of symptoms based on ecological momentary assessments. The level of agreement was calculated according to the Kappa statistic. RESULTS: Overall, we found limited agreement between the three approaches. Pairwise comparison showed moderate agreement between patient preference and symptom severity. Most patients preferred treatment for fatigue. Treatment for fear of cancer recurrence was mostly indicated when based on symptom severity. Agreement between temporal precedence and the other approaches was slight. A clear treatment advice based on temporal precedence was possible in 57% of cases. In cases where it was possible, all symptoms were about equally likely to be indicated. CONCLUSIONS: The three approaches lead to different treatment advices. Future research should determine how the approaches are related to treatment outcome. We propose to discuss the results of each approach in a shared decision-making process to make a well-informed and personalized decision with regard to which symptom to target in psychological treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: This study contributes to the development of systematic approaches for selecting the focus of psychological treatment in cancer survivors with co-occurring symptoms by providing and comparing three different systematic approaches for prioritizing symptoms.",0
Improving oncology first-in-human and Window of opportunity informed consent forms through participant feedback.,"BACKGROUND: Although patient advocates have developed templates for standard consent forms, evaluating patient preferences for first in human (FIH) and window of opportunity (Window) trial consent forms is critical due to their unique risks. FIH trials are the initial use of a novel compound in study participants. In contrast, Window trials give an investigational agent over a fixed duration to treatment naïve patients in the time between diagnosis and standard of care (SOC) surgery. Our goal was to determine the patient-preferred presentation of important information in consent forms for these trials. METHODS: The study consisted of two phases: (1) analyses of oncology FIH and Window consents; (2) interviews of trial participants. FIH consent forms were analyzed for the location(s) of information stating that the study drug has not been tested in humans (FIH information); Window consents were analyzed for the location(s) of information stating the trial may delay SOC surgery (delay information). Participants were asked about their preferred placement of the information in their own trial's consent form. The location of information in the consent forms was compared to the participants' suggestions for placement. RESULTS: 34 [17 FIH; 17 Window] of 42(81%) cancer patients approached participated. 25 consents [20 FIH; 5 Window] were analyzed. 19/20 FIH consent forms included FIH information, and 4/5 Window consent forms included delay information. 19/20(95%) FIH consent forms contained FIH information in the risks section 12/17(71%) patients preferred the same. Fourteen (82%) patients wanted FIH information in the purpose, but only 5(25%) consents mentioned it there. 9/17(53%) Window patients preferred delay information to be located early in the consent, before the ""Risks"" section.  3/5(60%) consents did this. CONCLUSIONS: Designing consents that reflect patient preferences more accurately is essential for ethical informed consent; however, a one-size fits all approach will not accurately capture patient preferences. We found that preferences differed for FIH and Window trial consents, though for both, patients preferred key risk information early in the consent. Next steps include determining if FIH and Window consent templates improve understanding.",0
Attributes underlying patient choice of treatment modality for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion complicated by high-risk human papillomavirus infection.,"OBJECTIVE: To use logistic regression to analyze the attributes underlying patients' treatment options for low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) complicated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection, and identify the best benefit group of different treatment options. METHODS: Clinical data of 197 LSIL patients with HR-HPV infection between June 2009 and February 2022 were collected. According to the treatment options chosen by the patients, they were divided into the interferon, photodynamic therapy, follow-up observation, and focused ultrasound (FUS) treatment groups. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the influencing factors, including age, occupation, education level, maternity history, reason for encounter, route of consultation, annual personal and household income, screening for related risk factors, and identifying the best benefit group of different treatment options. RESULTS: One-way ANOVA revealed a statistically significant difference in age, education level, maternity history, reason for encounter, and annual household income (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed on these five factors, indicating that age ≤35 years, high school educational level or higher, and no childbirth history were independent risk factors influencing patients' choices of FUS treatment. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the age threshold of 31 years. CONCLUSION: Age, educational level, and maternity history were independent risk factors influencing patients' choice of treatment modality for LSIL complicated with HR-HPV infection. Age ≤31 years, high school, equivalent, or higher educational level, and no childbirth yielded a higher rate of choosing FUS treatment for LSIL patients with HR-HPV infection.",0
Establishing a Pulmonary Nodule Clinic Service for Early Diagnosis of Lung Cancer - Review of International Options and Considerations for Greece.,"Early diagnosis of lung cancer in pulmonary nodules identified by computed tomography (CT) may be critical in reducing the epidemiological burden of the disease, particularly in countries where such a burden is considerably high and risk factors for lung cancer very prevalent. The establishment and operation of pulmonary nodule clinics (PNCs), ie, multidisciplinary services that watch and evaluate nodules found through deliberate screening efforts or as incidental findings, is increasingly becoming a key tool to implement such early-intervention, cancer-risk management policies elsewhere in the world. This review aims to research and present in a structured manner findings from published sources on options and considerations for setting up a PNC in a country such as Greece. These refer to the type of services a PNC would provide to optimize diagnosis of suspect pulmonary nodules, its structure and organization, including processes, human resources and technology infrastructure, its target audience, ie, who would be eligible to use its services, and the expected outcomes of its operation, in terms of a set of key performance indicators. Our review also revealed critical key success factors that should be considered when designing the introduction of a PNC in a health care setting, including optimal referral pathways, aligned clinical decision making and patient preferences and participation/empowerment. Our findings may inform health care systems with a high lung cancer burden and no available PNC service on options and considerations before introducing such a service in their respective settings.",0
Comparison of Comfort and Patient Preference of Common and a Novel Position for Ultrasound-Guided Carpal Tunnel Injections.,"OBJECTIVES: This study compared levels of discomfort among three positions for ultrasound-guided carpal tunnel injections (USCTI) to potentially facilitate and improve the procedure's tolerability in treating carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). METHODS: Ambulatory Veterans referred for electromyography (EMG) evaluation of CTS were eligible for the study; a total of 30 participants were evaluated. Participants were asked to hold three different positions: 1) Hypersupination, 2) Airplane, and 3) total supported abduction (TSA). Participants rated their pain level, ease of performing/holding each position, exacerbation of underlying symptoms, and position preference. Results were analyzed with two-way repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS: Hypersupination was determined to be the least preferred and most painful position to hold, demonstrating a statistically significant increase in the Numeric Rating Scale score for pain during the procedure compared with Airplane and TSA, which were not significantly different from one another. Pre-procedure neck, shoulder, elbow, and wrist pain were not significantly associated with intra-procedure pain. CONCLUSIONS: When performing USCTI, patient comfort can be optimized by avoiding Hypersupination. Utilizing the Airplane or TSA positions may provide similar access for ulnar approach injections while inducing lower levels of discomfort. Clinical space, resources, patient mobility, and laterality of procedures may further guide one's selection among the positions.",0
Patient Preferences for the Management of Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Kidney Transplantation: a Discrete Choice Experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in kidney transplant are common and debilitating. We aimed to ascertain patients' preferences for GI symptom management options to help future interventions align with treatment priorities. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was conducted with kidney transplant recipients in 3 Australian nephrology units. A multinomial logit model was used to quantify the preferences and trade-offs between 5 characteristics: cost, formulation, symptom burden, dietary changes, and medication quantities. RESULTS: Seventy patients participated (mean age ± SD: 47 ± 15 years, 56% female), 57% had GI symptoms. Patients preferred interventions that will achieve complete resolution of GI symptoms compared to no improvement (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 15.3 [1.80, 129.50]), were delivered as a tablet rather than a sachet (1.6 [1.27, 2.08]), retained their current diet compared to eliminating food groups (6.0 [2.19, 16.27]), reduced medication burden (1.4 [1.06, 1.79]), and had lower costs (0.98 [0.96, 1.00]). Participants would be willing to pay AUD$142.20 [$83.90, $200.40] monthly to achieve complete resolution of GI symptoms or AUD$100.90 [$9.60, $192.10] to have moderate improvement in symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions that are highly effective in relieving all GI symptoms without the need for substantive dietary changes, and in tablet form, are most preferred by kidney transplant recipients.",1
Queensland Inpatient Diabetes Survey (QuIDS): patient experience survey evaluation.,"BACKGROUND: Measurement of inpatient experience can allow for treatment tailored to patient preferences and needs. The patient experience of diabetes care has not been explored in Queensland hospitals. AIMS: To investigate the experiences of patients with diabetes when hospitalised using the Queensland Inpatient Diabetes Survey (QuIDS). METHODS: In 2019 and 2021, patient experience surveys were collected as part of the statewide QuIDS, a cross-sectional study assessing the quality of inpatient care received by people with diabetes in Queensland, Australia. Patient responses were categorised and frequencies reported as percentages. Free text comments were analysed using thematic analysis methods. Pooled descriptive data were presented. RESULTS: Responses were collected from 27 hospitals in 2019 (n = 526, 52.4% of all patients with diabetes) and 35 hospitals in 2021 (n = 709, 55.5%). Overall, patients were satisfied with their inpatient diabetes care. Areas for improvement identified by surveyed patients include the choice and timing of meals, staff knowledge about diabetes and increased diabetes self-management. Access to a specialist diabetes team was also identified as being potentially underutilised. Patient comments fell into four major themes: communication, food choices, patient autonomy and education. CONCLUSION: Many patients reported positive inpatient experiences; however, patients also expressed dissatisfaction with their inpatient diabetes care. Our data provide unique insight and an opportunity to improve standards of care and service provision for inpatients with diabetes.",0
"Cognitive-behavioral, behavioural and mindfulness-based therapies for insomnia in menopause.","OBJECTIVES: Insomnia is frequently reported by women during menopause due to physiological changes and environmental factors and is associated with negative daytime sequelae. Due to medication side effects and patient preferences, there is increased interest in the use of psychological treatments for menopausal insomnia. The primary objective of this review is to review the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral, behavioral, and mindfulness-based (CBBMB) therapies in treating insomnia in peri- and post-menopausal women. The secondary objective is to review the effect of CBBMB therapies on relevant secondary outcomes to gain a comprehensive understanding of their impacts. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of the literature. A search of PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted between January 2020 and March 2021. RESULTS: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia is efficacious, with corollary improvements in mood, functional outcomes and potential mechanistic factors (e.g., unhelpful beliefs). Sleep restriction therapy is also efficacious, with somewhat poorer effects on secondary outcomes relative to CBT. Mindfulness meditation and relaxation for insomnia demonstrated promise, but its long-term effects remain unknown. CONCLUSIONS: Research with more diverse samples and head-to-head comparisons is needed. Dissemination of CBBMBs for insomnia in clinics where menopausal women seek care is an important next step.",0
Use of Stated Preference Methods in HIV Treatment and Prevention Research in the United States: A Systematic Review.,"Stated preference (SP) methods are increasingly being applied to HIV-related research and continuously provide researchers with health utility scores of select healthcare products or services that populations consider important. Following PRISMA guidelines, we sought to understand how SP methods have been applied in HIV-related research. We conducted a systematic review to identify studies meeting the following criteria: SP method is clearly stated, conducted in the United States, was published between 01/01/2012 and 02/12/2022, and included adults aged 18 and over. Study design and SP method application were also examined. We identified six SP methods (e.g., Conjoint Analysis, Discrete Choice Experiment) across 18 studies, which were categorized into one of two groups: HIV prevention and HIV treatment-care. Categories of attributes used in SP methods largely focused on: administration, physical/health effects, financial, location, access, and external influences. SP methods are innovative tools capable of informing researchers on what populations consider most beneficial when deciding on treatment, care, or prevention options for HIV.",1
Optimizing care delivery in expanding health systems: Views from clinical leaders.,"INTRODUCTION: In response to intense market pressures, many hospitals have consolidated into systems. However, evidence suggests that consolidation has not led to the improvements in clinical quality promised by proponents of mergers. The challenges to delivering care within expanding health systems and the opportunities posed to surgical leaders remains largely unexplored. METHODS: Semistructured interviews with 30 surgical leaders at teaching hospitals affiliated with health systems from August-December 2019. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded in an iterative process using MaxQDA software. Attitudes and strategies toward redesigning health care delivery across expanding systems were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Leaders reported challenges to redesigning care delivery across the system ranging from resource constraints (e.g. hospital beds and operating rooms) to evolving market demands (e.g., patient preferences to receive care close to home). However, participants also highlighted that system expansion provided multiple opportunities to increase access (e.g. decant low-complexity care to affiliated centers) and improve quality of care (e.g. standardize best practices) for diverse populations including the potential to leverage their health system to expand access and improve quality. CONCLUSIONS: Though evidence suggests that hospital consolidation has not led to redesigned care delivery or improved clinical quality at a national level, leaders are pursuing varying sets of strategies aimed at leveraging system expansion in order to improve access and quality of care.",0

High-Grade Ectopic Pituitary Adenoma within the Cerebellopontine Angle: A Case Report.,"Ectopic pituitary tumors are neoplasms with no connection to the pituitary gland and are commonly deposited in other areas of the anterior skull base. A 32-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of right-sided facial weakness, sensorineural hearing loss, diplopia, and severe headaches. Physical examination revealed a mid-dilated sluggishly reactive right pupil with slight limitation in all gazes, as well as right-sided orbicularis weakness, lagophthalmos, and decreased facial sensation. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head without contrast revealed a 3.7 × 1.8 × 2.6 cm mildly enhancing mass in the right internal acoustic meatus and along the petrous ridge. The case was brought before the institution's tumor board, where concern for higher grade pathology, such as hemangiopericytoma, was discussed. Per patient preference, surgical biopsy of the tumor was performed. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a World Health Organization (WHO) grade II neuroendocrine tumor, with cells staining positive for synaptophysin, chromogranin, and CD56, with a K (i) -67 index of 8%. In addition to the ectopic location, this pituitary tumor was noted to be aggressive in nature based on its high K (i) -67 index. Surgical excision and radiologic therapy of tumors involving the CPA are appropriate treatments in most cases.",0
Contributing and limiting factors to guideline-adherent therapy in senior and elderly breast cancer patients: a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study using clinical and cancer registry data in Germany.,"PURPOSE: Elderly cancer patients are less likely to be treated in accordance with evidence-based guideline recommendations. This study examines patient-related factors associated with deviations from guideline recommendations. METHODS: Using medical documentation and cancer registry data, we investigated the treatment courses of female breast cancer patients aged 50 and older in Germany regarding compliance with German guidelines. Participants completed a questionnaire querying factors hypothesized to be associated with guideline adherence. We conducted univariate analyses to explore the data and select variables for multivariate logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: Of 1150 participants, 206 (17.9%) were treated in deviation from guideline recommendations. Patients 70 years and older were more likely to be treated deviating from guideline recommendations than patients 50-69 years old (OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.52-2.80). Patients aged 50-69 years who reported that quality of life guided their treatment decision were more likely to be treated in deviation from guideline recommendations (AOR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.11-3.92) than the elderly. In older patients, higher age was associated with an increased chance of receiving guideline-discordant care (AOR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01-1.11), as was depression diagnosed prior to cancer (AOR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.00-3.40). CONCLUSION: Reasons for deviations from guideline recommendations in breast cancer patients differ by age. In decision-making concerning elderly patients, particular attention should be paid to those with pre-existing depressive disorders. Adequately addressing their needs and concerns could prevent inappropriate deviations from guideline recommendations.",0
Patient Preferences for Attributes that Characterise Alternative Models of Care in Gastroenterology: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: Increased demand for gastroenterology services has resulted in growing waitlists, with patients at risk of exceeding clinically recommended wait-times. Given limited healthcare resources, expanded scope models of care are an option to help address this demand, but little is known about patient preferences for these models of care. METHODS: Low-risk gastroenterology patients (n = 1198) referred to an outpatient tertiary service in Australia over a 2-year period were invited to participate in an unlabelled discrete choice experiment with seven attributes: primary healthcare professional, wait-time, continuity of care, consultation length, manner and communication skills, reassurance, and cost. These were developed using qualitative research, literature review, and stakeholders' experiences. A d-efficient fractional design was used to construct four blocks of 12 choice sets, with two alternatives. A 13th choice set was included as a data and quality check. Latent class and mixed logit regression were used for analysis. The resulting preference parameters for individual attributes were then used to calculate willingness to pay and willingness to wait. RESULTS: Overall, the model based on the 347 respondents suggested no strong preference for professional background. All other attributes were statistically significant predictors of preference (p < 0.001), with respondents willing to make significant trade-offs (time and cost) before accepting deterioration in attributes. There was strong emphasis on manner and communication skills, with a clinician who listens and provides good explanations overwhelmingly the most important attribute. Latent class analysis identified two patient segments who differed in their preference for the primary treating healthcare professional (doctor or dietitian) based on exposure to either traditional medical or non-medical professional role substitution model. CONCLUSIONS: Patients have strong but varied preferences for gastroenterology services based on whether they have been exposed to expanded scope models of care. Design and implementation of new models of care need to consider strategies to overcome any perceived loss in utility or deterioration in healthcare quality for those unfamiliar with professional role substitution.",1
National survey on management of spontaneous pneumothorax from emergency department to specialised treatment: room for improvement.,"INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) affects both young, otherwise healthy individuals and older persons with known underlying pulmonary disease. Initial management possibilities are evolving and range from observation to chest tube insertion. SP guidelines suggest an individualized approach based on multiple factors such as symptoms, size of pneumothorax, comorbidity and patient preference. AIM: With this Danish national survey we aimed to map organization of care including involved specialties, treatment choice, training, and follow-up plans to identify aspects, and optimization of spontaneous pneumothorax management. METHOD: A survey developed by the national interest group for pleural medicine was sent to all departments of emergency medicine, thoracic surgery, respiratory medicine, and to relevant departments of abdominal or orthopaedic surgery. RESULTS: The response rate was 75 % (47 of 65). Overall, 21% of responding departments had no guideline for SP management, which was provided by multiple specialties with marked heterogeneity in choice of treatment including tube size, management during admission, and referral procedure to follow-up. Few departments required procedure training, and nearly all of the responders called for improvements in management of pneumothorax. CONCLUSION: This survey suggests that SP management and care is delivered heterogeneously across Danish hospitals with marked difference between respiratory physicians, emergency physicians, general surgeons and thoracic surgeons. It is therefore likely that management is sub-optimal. There is a need for a common Danish SP guideline to ensure optimal treatment across involved specialties.",0
Prolonged diversion after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis: Is it safe to wait?,"AIM: Diverting loop ileostomy reversal (DLI-R) is routinely performed from 2-6 months following ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). The safety of delayed reversal after IPAA is not well-defined. The aim of this study was to determine if prolonged diversion is associated with adverse outcomes compared to routine closure. METHODS: Adult patients undergoing primary IPAA with DLI from 2000 to 2021 were included in this retrospective cohort study from our institutional database. Patients were stratified into tertiles based on timing of reversal: Routine (56-116 days), Delayed (117-180 days), or Prolonged (>6 months). Univariate analysis compared categorical variables between groups. Patients reversed at <8 weeks were excluded. RESULTS: In total, 2615 patients underwent DLI-R following IPAA (3-stage 61%, 2-stage 39%; mean age 39.9 years). DLI-R was performed as Routine, Delayed and Prolonged in 1908 (72.9%), 426 (16.4%) and 281 (10.8%), respectively. Overall, DLI-R related complications occurred in 12.4% (n = 324). The complication rate in the Routine group was 11% (n = 210), in the Delayed group was 12.2% (n = 52) and in the Prolonged group was 22.1% (n = 62). Reasons for prolonged diversion in the Prolonged group were complications at the time of IPAA in 207 (73.9%) or patient preference/scheduling in 73 (26.1%). DLI-R >6 months after IPAA due to complications had higher rates of overall complications following ileostomy reversal (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.85-3.72, p < 0.001) whereas when DLI-R was delayed due to preference/scheduling outcomes were not different than the Routine group (p = 0.28). CONCLUSION: Prolonged time to ileostomy reversal after IPAA is probably safe without increased risk of complications when due to patient preference.",0
The heterogeneity of public preferences for the first healthcare visit: A discrete choice experiment in the context of Vietnam.,"Primary healthcare is critical in addressing the main health problems of communities. In Vietnam, the increasing healthcare demands cause major challenges, especially overcrowding. This study identified public preferences regarding the selection of healthcare facilities for first visit. A discrete choice online survey was generated from five attributes including visit duration, travel time, personal connection with medical staff, doctors' experience, and health insurance. A D(z) -efficient design constructed 36 choice sets, divided into three blocks of 12 choice sets. Each block formed one version of the questionnaire, which was randomly distributed to the participants. Heterogeneity in participant preferences was analysed by a latent class model with socio demographic characteristics and experiences of the last visit. 822 participants valued doctors' experience for both minor and severe symptoms. Preference heterogeneity for minor symptoms was quick service provision, highly experienced doctors, and payment through health insurance for the first (44.18%), second (32.17%), and third classes (23.66%), respectively. Regarding severe symptoms, they favoured all five attributes, quick health service, and reduced travel time for the first, second, and third classes, respectively (heterogeneities of 58.16%, 27.79%, and 14.05%, respectively). Predictions of choice from the worst to optimal healthcare facility scenario were 8.91%-61.91% and 10.16%-69.83% for minor and severe symptoms, respectively. Knowledge regarding public preference heterogeneity supports policymakers increase public acceptance in choosing primary healthcare facilities. Visit duration and doctors' experience should be considered a priority in decision making.",1
A discrete choice experiment on oral and injection treatment preferences among moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients in Japan.,"Long-term psoriasis (PsO) management remains challenging. With growing variation in treatment efficacy, cost, and modes of administration, patient preferences for different treatment characteristics are not well understood. A discrete choice experiment (DCE), informed by qualitative patient interviews, was conducted to assess patient preferences for different attributes of PsO treatments; 222 adult patients with moderate-to-severe PsO receiving systemic therapy participated in the DCE web survey. Better long-term efficacy and lower cost were preferred (preference weights p < 0.05). Long-term efficacy had the highest relative importance (RI) and mode of administration was as important as the outcome attributes (efficacy and safety). Patients also preferred oral to injectable administration. In subgroup analyses by disease severity, residence, psoriatic arthritis as a comorbidity, and gender, the trends for each subgroup were the same as the overall population although the extent of RI for administration mode varied. Mode of administration was more important for patients with moderate versus severe disease, or rural versus urban residence. This DCE utilized attributes related to both oral and injectable treatment as well as a broad study population of systemic treatment users. Preferences were further stratified by patient characteristics to explore trends in different subgroups. Understanding the RI of treatment attributes and the attribute trade-offs acceptable to patients helps inform moderate-to-severe PsO systemic treatments decisions.",1

Patient preferences in treatment options of ulcerative colitis: a discrete choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Since the number of medical treatment options for Ulcerative Colitis (UC) has expanded over the last decades, patients and physicians face challenges regarding decisions about the medication options. We aimed to identify patients' preferences about their UC treatment options in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we assessed after how many failed treatment options, patients are willing to consider surgical treatment. METHODS: We conducted a web-based, multicenter, discrete choice experiment (DCE) among adult UC patients. Patients were repeatedly asked to choose between two hypothetical medicinal treatment options. The choice tasks were based on administration route, administration location, chance of symptom reduction (on short and long term) and chances on infection and other adverse events. Data were analyzed by using Hierarchical Bayes estimation. RESULTS: A total of 172 UC patients participated in the DCE. More than half were anti-TNF experienced (52.9%). The chance of symptom reduction after one year (relative importance (RI) 27.7 (95% CI 26.0-29.4)) was most important in choosing between medicinal treatments, followed by the chance of infection (RI 22.3 (21.4 - 23.3)) and chance of symptom reduction after eight weeks (RI 19.5 (18.3 - 20.6)). Considering surgical treatment, nineteen patients (14.3%) would not even consider surgery after failing eight treatment options without any new available therapies left. Nine patients would consider surgery before trying any treatment options. CONCLUSION: We found that symptom reduction after one year was the most important attribute in choosing between treatments in UC patients. These outcomes can help understand the trade-offs and preferences of UC patients.",1

Endovascular Management of Brain Arteriovenous Malformations.,"Due to the risk of cerebral hemorrhage, and its related morbidity-mortality, brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs) are a rare and potentially life-threatening disease. Despite this, there is only one randomized controlled trial on bAVM management, A Randomized trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous malformations (ARUBA). The results of the ARUBA trial favor a noninterventional approach in the case of an unruptured bAVM; however, implementation of these findings is challenging in daily practice. Instead, management of bAVM relies on multidisciplinary discussions that lead to patient-specific strategies based on patient preferences, local expertise, and experience in referral centers. Considering the diverse patterns of presentation and numerous treatment modalities, implementing standardized guidelines in this context proves challenging, notwithstanding the recommendations or expert opinions offered. Endovascular treatment (EVT) of bAVM can be curative, or can serve as an adjunct treatment prior to surgery or radiosurgery (""pre-EVT""). EVT practice is in constant evolution (i.e., venous approach, combination with surgery during the same anesthesia, etc.). Liquid embolic agents such as ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) copolymer and cyanoacrylates (CYA), and their method of injection to increase bAVM occlusion have also benefited from technical evolutions such as the use of adjunctive flow arrest techniques (mini balloons, pressure cooker technique, and multiple catheters). Further research is necessary to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of EVT for bAVM.",0
Hospital-based spiritual care: what matters to patients?,"Demographic changes in Australia have led to an increase in both religious diversity and the number of people who do not nominate a faith affiliation at hospital admission. Models of chaplaincy have shifted from clerical and largely male to an increasingly skilled and diverse spiritual care workforce appointed directly by health services. This study uses survey and in-depth interview methods at an inner-city Australian hospital to examine patient preferences for hospital chaplaincy provided by faith communities, and the importance of faith affiliation compared to other spiritual care provider characteristics. Survey results indicate that of 110 respondents, a high proportion (74%) prefer spiritual care to be provided by a person of the same faith. However, when considered relative to other characteristics, faith affiliation was not as important as kindness, listening skills and a non-judgmental attitude. Our findings have implications for workforce planning and educating. Further research in different settings and with different populations will make the findings more generalizable.",0
Clinical Practices Surrounding the Prescription of Home Oxygen in Patients With COPD and Desaturation.,"PURPOSE: While home oxygen therapy increases survival in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have severe resting hypoxemia, recent evidence suggests that there is no survival benefit of home oxygen for patients with COPD who have isolated exertional desaturation. We aimed to understand clinician practice patterns surrounding the prescription of home oxygen for patients with COPD. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews via videoconference with 15 physicians and 3 nurse practitioners who provide care for patients with COPD. Clinicians were recruited through the American Lung Association Airways Clinical Research Centers. Interview guides were created with the assistance of patient investigators and included questions regarding clinician practices surrounding the prescription of oxygen for patients with COPD and the use of clinical guidelines. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded for themes. RESULTS: Of the 18 clinician interviewees, one-third were women, with most participants (n=11) being < 50 years old. Results of the semi-structured interviews suggested research evidence, clinical experience, and patient preferences contributed to clinician decision-making. Most clinicians described a shared decision-making process for prescribing home oxygen for patients, including discussion of risks and benefits, and developing an understanding of patient values and preferences. Clinicians did not use a structured tool to conduct these conversations. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians consider a number of patient and clinical factors when prescribing home oxygen therapy, often using a shared decision-making process. Tools to support shared decision-making about the use of home oxygen are needed.",0
Laparoscopic versus robotic inguinal hernia repair: a single-center case-matched study.,"INTRODUCTION: Robotic inguinal hernia repair (RIHR) is becoming increasingly common and is the minimally invasive alternative to laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR). Thus far, there is little data directly comparing LIHR and RIHR. The purpose of this study will be to compare outcomes for LIHR and RIHR at a single center. METHODS: A prospective institutional hernia database was queried for patients who underwent transabdominal LIHR or RIHR from 2012 to 2020. The patients were then matched based on the surgeon performing the operation (single, expert hernia surgeon) and laterality of repair. Standard descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: There were 282 patients who met criteria for the study, 141 LIHR and 141 RIHR; 32.6% of patients in each group had a bilateral repair (p = 1.00). LIHR patients were slightly younger (54.4 ± 15.6 vs 58.6 ± 13.8; p = 0.03) but similar in terms of BMI (27.1 ± 5.1 vs 29.1 ± 2.1; p = 0.70) and number of comorbidities (2.9 ± 2.5 vs 2.6 ± 2.2; p = 0.59). Operative time was found to be longer in the RIHR group, but when evaluating RIHR at the beginning of the study versus the end of the study, there was a 50-min decrease in operative time (p < 0.01). Recurrence rates were low for both groups (0.7% vs 1.4%; p = 0.38) with mean follow-up time 13.0 ± 13.3 months. There was only one wound infection, which was in the robotic group. No patients required return to the operating room for complications relating to their surgery. There were no 30-day readmissions in the LIHR group and three 30-day readmissions in the RIHR group (p = 0.28). CONCLUSION: LIHR and RIHR are both performed with low morbidity and have comparable overall outcomes. The total charges were increased in the RIHR group. Either LIHR or RIHR may be considered when performing inguinal hernia repair and should depend on surgeon and patient preference; continued evaluation of the outcomes is warranted.",0
Retreatment rates and postprocedural complications are higher than expected after BPH surgeries: a US healthcare claims and utilization study.,"BACKGROUND: Up to 50% of men over 50 and 80% over 80 are affected by BPH. Shared decision-making regarding BPH treatment options can benefit from an improved understanding of relative risks and benefits for various treatments. METHODS: Data for this longitudinal retrospective population-based cohort study were obtained from a random sample of US Medicare and commercial claims (IBM Watson MarketScan) and restricted to men undergoing BPH surgery (TURP, PVP, PUL, WVTT) from 2015 to 2021 across all sites of service. Retreatments included Holmium laser enucleation and index procedures. Main outcomes were rates of retreatment and procedural complications over 1 year, identified via CPT and ICD-9/10CM codes. Procedural complications that occurred at least 1 day post-index treatment were assessed, as were surgical retreatments with patients who had at least 1 and 5 year's-worth of data. Baseline phenotype characterization did not control for symptomatology and was limited to age, comorbidities, and BMI. Univariate cumulative incidence estimates, cumulative proportion and log-rank tests justified inclusion for covariate (e.g., age, comorbidities) adjustment in Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: 43,147 men diagnosed with BPH underwent 22,629 TURP, 11,392 PVP, 7,529 PUL, and 1,597 WVTT. At 1-year post-index: PUL was associated with the lowest rate of complication (PUL 15%, TURP 17%; PVP 19%, ; WVTT 26%); retreatment rates were not different (TURP 5.3%, PVP 5.3%, PUL 5.9%, WVTT 6.2%). At 5 years post-index: retreatment was lowest for TURP (7.0%) and was not significantly different between PVP and PUL (8.9% and 11.6%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Real-world patients diagnosed with BPH may be selected to undergo one of the various available therapies based on patient preference or baseline phenotype. These therapies, however, are associated with different risks for complications. The results of this study suggest that within one year of BPH surgery, one-in-twenty patients may require retreatment regardless of treatment choice, and for some technologies as many as one-in-four may require treatment for a complication.",0
Patient characteristics and preferences for a surgical prehabilitation program design: results from a pilot survey.,"PURPOSE: Surgical prehabilitation aims to reduce a decline in the functional capacity thereby optimising health and fitness before surgery. One of the major barriers in successfully implementing a prehabilitation program in hospitals has been poor patient adherence. In our pilot survey on surgical patients, we sought to explore patient preferences regarding the program design, the barriers and enablers to patient participation in a multimodal prehabilitation program. METHODS: The survey was administered to patients undergoing major abdominal surgery in the preoperative period. The first two parts of the instrument mainly included questions on demographics, social history, activity levels, interest towards prehabilitation program and their involvement in co-design, preferences towards the components of the program, the barriers and enablers. The last part of survey included symptom and physical assessments. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 24 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. The median age of our cohort was 71 (range 35-91) years and 75% were retired. 75% of our participants were extremely interested in improving health and fitness and 63% were very keen to co-design their program when explained. Home-based programs were preferred by most participants and among exercises, walking was preferred by 71% of the participants. One third of the participants were interested in professional dietary counselling. There were only two participants who preferred group psychological therapy while 25% preferred individual psychological counselling sessions. CONCLUSION: Our survey highlighted a need to design a personalised program with tailored interventions due to the wide variation in the interest and preferences among surgical patients.",0

Decision Making About Disease-Modifying Treatments for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis: Stated Preferences and Real-World Choices.,"BACKGROUND: People with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis can benefit from disease-modifying treatments (DMTs). Several DMTs are available that vary in their efficacy, side-effect profile and mode of administration. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to measure the preferences of people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis for DMTs using a discrete choice experiment and to assess which stated preference attributes correlate with the attributes of the DMTs they take in the real world. METHODS: Discrete choice experiment attributes were developed from literature reviews, interviews and focus groups. In a discrete choice experiment, participants were shown two hypothetical DMTs, then chose whether they preferred one of the DMTs or no treatment. A mixed logit model was estimated from responses and individual-level estimates of participants' preferences conditional on their discrete choice experiment choices calculated. Logit models were estimated with stated preferences predicting current real-world on-treatment status, DMT mode of administration and current DMT. RESULTS: A stated intrinsic preference for taking a DMT was correlated with currently taking a DMT, and stated preferences for mode of administration were correlated with the modes of administration of the DMTs participants were currently taking. Stated preferences for treatment effectiveness and adverse effects were not correlated with real-world behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: There was variation in which discrete choice experiment attributes correlated with participants' real-world DMT choices. This may indicate patient preferences for treatment efficacy/risk are not adequately taken account of in prescribing. Treatment guidelines must ensure they take into consideration patients' preferences and improve communication around treatment efficacy/risk.",1
Surgical Approach to Bilateral Inguinal Hernia. A Case-Control Study.,"Introduction: Bilateral inguinal hernia can be safely repaired simultaneously, open or minimally invasive, in an elective sce-nario. The choice of surgical approach depends on the patient's status, hernia characteristics, surgeons and patient preferences. Whether age criteria should be considered when selecting between the two approaches is still a matter of debate. Considering that there is no consensus regarding the best repair in bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy, the aim of the study is to perform an analysis regarding elective surgical approach of patients with bilateral inguinal hernias. Material and Methods: To study the relationship between exposure to an open versus laparoscopic approach in patients with bilateral inguinal hernia, we conducted a case-control study. In our retrospective analysis, cases (23 patients) were the open-approach hernia repair, and controls (82 patients) were laparoscopic hernia repair. We analyzed two sets of variables: first, related to patient characteristics (age 65 years, BMI 30 kg/m2, smoking habit, HTA status, COPD status, DM status, use of anticoagulants, presence of neoplastic status) and second, variables related to hernia features (inguinoscrotal hernia, recurrent hernia and complicated hernia). Results: The mean age for cases was 73.26 (Ã+-12.99) years and that of controls, was 56.48 (Ã+-15.15) years. Univariate analysis demonstrated four variables with statistical significance: age 65 years, inguinoscrotal hernia, neo-plastic status, and anticoagulant use. When introduced into the multivariate analysis, we noted that only two variables, age 65 years (OR=4.183, 95% CI [1.289, 13.572], p=0.017) and use of anticoagulants (OR=38.876, 95% CI [1.305, 1158.011], p=0.035) reached statistical significance. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that when we refer to bilateral inguinal hernia repair, patients aged 65 years are at risk of having an open procedure at least fourfold more than patients aged 65 years. In addition, the use of anticoagulants increases the risk of open hernia repair 38 times more than that of minimally invasive repair for the same age group. Interestingly, in our study, hernia characteristics were not found to be associated with open hernia repair and age 65 years. In our study we found that age 65 years is associated with electing open hernia repair over minimally invasive repair, which can be linked to age-related risk factors. Further re-search is needed to investigate the impact of age and age-related risk factors on surgical outcomes of bilateral inguinal hernia repair.",0
Exploring older peoples' attitudes and preferences around the use of their healthcare information.,"AIMS: Routinely collected health data can provide rich information for research and epidemiological monitoring of different diseases, but using the data presents many challenges. This study aims to explore the attitudes and preferences of people aged 55 and over regarding the use of their de-identified health data, and their concerns and comfort in different scenarios. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted with people aged 55 and over currently engaged with health services in a New Zealand health district during June-October 2022. The survey could be completed online or by telephone and was available in eight languages. RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of respondents knew that their health information was currently being used in the ways described in the scenarios, and between 80-87% felt comfortable or very comfortable with their data being used as described in the scenarios. In contrast, 4% (n=9) felt ""uncomfortable"" or ""very uncomfortable"" across all of the scenarios. Participants expressed concerns about data accuracy, privacy and confidentiality, security, transparency of use, consent, feedback and the risk of data being sold to commercial companies. Some participants identified situations where permission should be required to link data, including being used by people other than health professionals, containing sensitive health issues, or being used for commercial purposes. CONCLUSION: This study finds general support from patients for the use of their routinely collected data for secondary purposes as long as its use will benefit the population from which the data are taken. It also highlights the necessity of including the perspectives of different cultures in the collection, storage, use and analysis of health information, particularly concerning Māori cultural considerations.",0
Patient decisions regarding cancer gene panel testing: An exploratory study.,"This study examined factors associated with the selection of a specific multi-gene panel test by patients in a cancer genetic counseling clinic. We surveyed patients who received pre-test genetic counseling at the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Cancer Risk Assessment (CCRA) in 2019 and their genetic counselors to assess demographic and clinical characteristics, patient concerns, and session outcome. Ultimately, 228 eligible participants completed the survey, of whom 85.1% consented to genetic testing. Of those who chose testing, 56.2% selected the largest panel type available, a pan-cancer panel that included both actionable and inactionable genes. White patients were more likely than non-white patients to pursue testing. Among testers, number of testing options offered, participant educational attainment, age, and NCCN Guidelines status were associated with patient choice between four panel options. Some patient concerns, including impact of results on future cancer screening and family dynamics, were also linked to test choice. Several other participant characteristics including income, cancer diagnosis, and family structure did not appear to be predictive of testing choice. Our results confirmed the patient preference for large gene panels and identified a limited number of associations between patient characteristics and concerns and testing choice. We noted however that a significant number of participants did not choose the most commonly selected test, and that test choice is difficult to predict based on clinical and demographic factors. Our results also provide further evidence of well-documented disparities in cancer genetic testing. Study limitations do not allow our findings to be generalized to all cancer genetic counseling patients. Further research is needed to examine how and why patients choose between multiple genetic test options in the cancer setting. This study was one of the first to examine patient choice between a full spectrum of multi-gene panel options.",0
Pretesting Discrete-Choice Experiments: A Guide for Researchers.,"Discrete-choice experiments (DCEs) are a frequently used method to explore the preferences of patients and other decision-makers in health. Pretesting is an essential stage in the design of a high-quality choice experiment and involves engaging with representatives of the target population to improve the readability, presentation, and structure of the preference instrument. The goal of pretesting in DCEs is to improve the validity, reliability, and relevance of the survey, while decreasing sources of bias, burden, and error associated with preference elicitation, data collection, and interpretation of the data. Despite its value to inform DCE design, pretesting lacks documented good practices or clearly reported applied examples. The purpose of this paper is: (1) to define pretesting and describe the pretesting process specifically in the context of a DCE, (2) to present a practical guide and pretesting interview discussion template for researchers looking to conduct a rigorous pretest of a DCE, and (3) to provide an illustrative example of how these resources were operationalized to inform the design of a complex DCE aimed at eliciting tradeoffs between personal privacy and societal benefit in the context of a police method known as investigative genetic genealogy (IGG).",1
