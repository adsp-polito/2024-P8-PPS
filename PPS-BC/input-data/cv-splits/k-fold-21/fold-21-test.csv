Using MaxDiff Analysis to Elicit Patients' Treatment Preferences for Distal Radius Fractures in Patients Aged 60 Years and Older.,"PURPOSE: The objective of our study was to determine how the attributes of surgical and nonsurgical distal radius fracture (DRF) treatments affect patient treatment preferences. METHODS: Two hundred fifty patients aged 60 years and older were contacted from a single-hand surgeon's practice, and 172 chose to participate. We built a series of best-worst scaling experiments for the MaxDiff analysis to determine the relative importance of treatment attributes. Hierarchical Bayes analysis was used to generate individual-level item scores (ISs) for each attribute that together have a total sum of 100. RESULTS: One hundred general hand clinic patients without a history of a DRF and 43 patients with a history of a DRF completed the survey. For the general hand clinic patients, the most important attributes to avoid when choosing a DRF treatment (in descending order) were the longer time to full recovery (IS, 24.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.4-26.3), longer time spent in a cast (IS, 22.8; 95% CI, 21.5-24.2), and higher complication rates (IS, 18.4; 95% CI, 16.9-19.8). Meanwhile, for patients with a history of a DRF, the most important attributes to avoid (in descending order) were a longer time to full recovery (IS, 25.6; 95% CI, 23.3-27.9), longer time spent in a cast (IS, 22.8; 95% CI, 19.9-25.7), and abnormal alignment of the radius on x-ray (IS, 18.3; 95% CI, 15.4-21.3). For both the groups, the least concerning attributes based on the IS were appearance-scar, appearance-bump, and the need for anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Eliciting patient preferences is a vital component of shared decision-making and advancing patient-centered care. As conceptualized in this MaxDiff analysis, when choosing a DRF treatment, patients mostly want to avoid a longer time to full recovery and a longer time in a cast, whereas patients have the least concern about appearance and need for anesthesia. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Eliciting patient preferences is a vital component of shared decision-making. Our results may provide guidance to surgeons in discussions on the relative benefits of surgical and nonsurgical DRF treatments, by quantifying the most and least important factors to patients.",1
Mixed methods study of attitudes on location of gynaecological oncology outpatient care: a patient and healthcare professional questionnaire.,"OBJECTIVE: Gynaecological oncology place of care is often based on evolution of services, along historical professional boundaries, rather than user needs or preferences. We aimed to assess existing evidence, gather views of patients in the UK on their preferred place of outpatient care for gynaecological malignancies and evaluate alignment with preferences of healthcare professionals (HCP). METHODS: We performed a mixed methods study, including a scoping review, a patient survey and a healthcare practitioner questionnaire. We collected quantitative and qualitative data, performing content analysis to determine current practice and impact on patients. RESULTS: No studies were identified in our scoping review. We received responses from 159 patients and 54 gynaecological oncology HCPs. There was a strong preference for a dedicated gynaecological oncology setting (89% somewhat or very happy) (p<0.0001). Fifty-three percent of patients were somewhat or very unhappy to have care colocated with general obstetrics and gynaecology services. Specifically, two key themes were identified through content analysis of qualitative data from patients: 'environment and getting this right is vital'; and 'our cancer should be the priority'. HCPs underestimated the strong patient preference to be seen in dedicated units. Of those who see patients within general obstetrics and gynaecology, only 50% said patients were seen at separate times/locations from obstetric patients. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the significant impact of place of care on gynaecological oncology patients, which may be underestimated by HCPs.",0
Patient preferences for stress urinary incontinence treatments: a discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: To elicit and value patient preferences for the processes and outcomes of surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women. DESIGN: A discrete choice experiment survey to elicit preferences for type of anaesthesia, postoperative recovery time, treatment success, adverse events, impact on daily activities and cost. An experimental design generated 40 choice tasks, and each respondent completed 1 block of 10 and 2 validity tests. Analysis was by multinomial logistical regression. SETTING: N=21 UK hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: N=325 adult women who were a subsample of those randomised to the single-incision mini-slings clinical trial. OUTCOMES: Patient preferences; valuation obtained using willingness to pay. RESULTS: N=227 of 325 (70%) returned a questionnaire, and 94% of those completed all choice tasks. Respondents preferred general anaesthesia, shorter recovery times, improved stress urinary incontinence symptoms and avoidance of adverse events. Women were willing to pay (mean (95% CI)) £76 (£33 to £119) per day of reduction in recovery time following surgery. They valued increases in Patient Global Impression of Improvement, ranging from £8173 (£5459 to £10 887) for 'improved' to £11 706 (£8267 to £15 144) for 'very much improved' symptoms, compared with no symptom improvement. This was offset by negative values attached to the avoidance of complications ranging between £-8022 (£-10 661 to £-5383) and £-10 632 (£-14 077 to £-7187) compared to no complications. Women valued treatments that reduced the need to avoid daily activities, with willingness to pay ranging from £-967 (£-2199 to £266) for rarely avoiding activities to £-5338 (£-7258 to £-3417) for frequently avoiding daily activities compared with no avoidance. CONCLUSION: This discrete choice experiment demonstrates that patients place considerable value on improvement in stress urinary incontinence symptoms and avoidance of treatment complications. Trade-offs between symptom improvement and adverse event risk should be considered within shared decision-making. The willingness to pay values from this study can be used in future cost-benefit analyses. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN: 93264234; Post-results.",1
In the thick of it: A commentary on the strength of evidence for thickened fluids.,"Purpose: The efficacy of thickened fluids for individuals with dysphagia has come under increasing scrutiny among healthcare professionals. This commentary provides a critical appraisal of the research evidence and presents a balanced argument on the benefits and limitations of thickened fluids in dysphagia management. By doing so, we aim to engage the readership to think critically about this controversial topic and make informed, patient-centered decisions regarding the use of thickened fluids in dysphagia management.Result/Conclusion: We argue that, while the research evidence for the use of thickened fluids in dysphagia management continues to grow, perhaps our problem lies in trying to find one pure answer-to thicken or not to thicken. We encourage clinicians to move past arguments about the controversies of thickened fluids and, rather, use the current evidence base, including research evidence, clinical expertise, and patient preferences to support individuals with dysphagia to make informed choices about their oral intake, in the short and long term.",0
Patient Preferences and Perceptions Concerning Aesthetic Providers and Social Media.,"BACKGROUND: With the rise of social media, aesthetic providers have established a presence on social media. However, there has been little research to evaluate how patients perceive these aesthetic providers and what they desire to see on their professional accounts. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the social media preferences and perceptions of patients who undergo aesthetic procedures. METHODS: A survey was sent to a random sample of US individuals; 651 (32%) identified that they underwent aesthetic procedures. Descriptive statistics were utilized to analyze participants and groups were compared with chi-square analyses. RESULTS: Our sample had a majority of females (57% female, 43% male). An aesthetic medical provider's social media presence had a positive impact on 41% of respondents; a minority of respondents (9%) preferred no social media presence. Fifty-five percent of respondents indicated they would prefer to see a provider with a blue checkmark. With regard to content published, 70% of respondents found it important that a provider show before and after photographs. One-third of respondents indicated they would prefer not to see personal content (n = 236, 36%). CONCLUSIONS: A social media presence is not a strict requirement for success, but 41% of respondents reported a social media presence positively impacted their desire to see the provider as a patient. Patients preferred certain characteristics, such as verification and before and after photographs. Aesthetic providers should take care when determining what content to publish to their social accounts and should consider focusing on educational, promotional, and family/interpersonal content.",0
"Prostate Cancer, Version 4.2023, NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology.","The NCCN Guidelines for Prostate Cancer provide a framework on which to base decisions regarding the workup of patients with prostate cancer, risk stratification and management of localized disease, post-treatment monitoring, and treatment of recurrence and advanced disease. The Guidelines sections included in this article focus on the management of metastatic castration-sensitive disease, nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and metastatic CRPC (mCRPC). Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with treatment intensification is strongly recommended for patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. For patients with nonmetastatic CRPC, ADT is continued with or without the addition of certain secondary hormone therapies depending on prostate-specific antigen doubling time. In the mCRPC setting, ADT is continued with the sequential addition of certain secondary hormone therapies, chemotherapies, immunotherapies, radiopharmaceuticals, and/or targeted therapies. The NCCN Prostate Cancer Panel emphasizes a shared decision-making approach in all disease settings based on patient preferences, prior treatment exposures, the presence or absence of visceral disease, symptoms, and potential side effects.",0
Direct-to-consumer orthodontics: Exploring laypeople's perception of orthodontic treatment complexity.,"BACKGROUND: The authors aimed to explore the treatment preferences of laypeople regarding direct-to-consumer (DTC) orthodontics and to identify whether case complexity, as perceived by laypeople, is one of the factors influencing interest in DTC orthodontics. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted. Data analysis was performed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 1,362 surveys were completed. A significant inverse association was identified between the complexity of an orthodontic case, as measured using the American Board of Orthodontics' discrepancy index (DI) score, and the likelihood of choosing DTC treatment over an orthodontist. Participants were 3.53 times more likely to choose DTC treatment for a mild case (DI score, 0-10) compared with a complex case (DI score, > 20), although the likelihood of choosing DTC treatment for a moderate case (DI score, 11-20) was only 1.79 times higher than for a complex case. CONCLUSIONS: When laypeople were asked to consider each case as if it were their own dentition, there was a significant inverse association between the complexity of an orthodontic case, as measured using the DI score, and the likelihood of choosing DTC treatment over an orthodontist. Laypeople were seemingly more likely to choose DTC orthodontics for dentitions that did not appear crowded and were well aligned within the arches. Laypeople seemed to have an understanding that there are some limitations to DTC orthodontics. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Orthodontists should better understand the factors influencing consumers' decisions to select DTC orthodontics and dental organizations should focus their educational campaigns on these factors.",0
Cancer Patients' Preferences and Perceptions of Advantages and Disadvantages of Telehealth Visits During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"PURPOSE: We aimed to ascertain oncology patients' perceptions of telehealth versus in-person (IP) visits for different types of clinical encounters. METHODS: We surveyed adults undergoing cancer treatment at Kaiser Permanente Northern California infusion centers between November 2021 and May 2022 using a self-administered questionnaire. Patients were asked about visit modality preferences (video, phone, and IP) for six types of clinical discussions, overall advantages and disadvantages of telehealth (video or phone) versus IP modalities, and barriers to video visit use. RESULTS: The 839 patients who completed surveys in English were 63% female; median age 63 years; 64% White; and 73% college-educated (45% ≥bachelor's degree). For the first postdiagnosis discussion visit, 83% of patients preferred IP, followed by video (27%) and phone (18%). For follow-up visits, 52% of patients preferred IP, 50% video, and 37% phone. For discussions of bad news and sensitive topics, respectively, 68% and 62% preferred IP, 44% and 48% video, and 32% and 41% phone visits. Delivery of good news was acceptable through IP (49%), video (52%), or phone (49%) visits. Perceived advantages of IP visits were greater feelings of connection with their doctor (58%), confidence in physical examinations (73%), and ease in showing things (67%) and talking (51%) to the doctor. Advantages of telehealth visits included saved time (72%) and money (38%), less infection exposure (64%), less travel concerns (45%), and ability to include more people (28%). Of 24% of patients who felt video visits would be hard, 51% cited poor internet, 41% lack of an adequate device, and 28% difficulty signing on. CONCLUSION: Our results support continued use and reimbursement for telehealth visits with patients with cancer for most types of clinical encounters, including clinical trials.",0
Supporting the Safe Use of the Dorsogluteal Intramuscular Injection Site: An Evidence-Based Quality Improvement Project.,"INTRODUCTION: Administering intramuscular (IM) injections is common in the adult mental health patient care setting, using the deltoid, vastus lateralis, ventrogluteal, or dorsogluteal site. Mental health nurses frequently use the dorsogluteal site to administer short and long-acting IM injections as specified in the drug package insert or because of patient agitation. However, the site is often not recommended due to the potential risk of nerve injury. AIMS: Aims of this evidence-based quality improvement project were to (1) determine the best evidence for supporting the safe use of the dorsogluteal site for short and long-acting IM injections and (2) implement this evidence through nurse education. METHOD: This project had two phases: Determining best evidence through an integrative literature review and implementing the recommendations to use the dorsogluteal site when directed by the drug package insert, clinical need, nursing judgment, or patient preference. Implementation followed the Plan-Do-Study-Act quality improvement process and involved written resources and simulation. RESULTS: Evidence supported the use of the dorsogluteal site in four instances and the importance of education. Nurses were highly satisfied with the education and opportunity to practice their skills with feedback during return demonstration. After studying nurses' follow-up survey results, a refresher simulation and medical center guideline were completed. There were no reports of IM injection patient injuries after 2 years and approximately 768 dorsogluteal and ventrogluteal IM injections in the academic medical center. CONCLUSION: Pursuing recent and possibly overlooked evidence provided guidance in supporting the safe use of the dorsogluteal site for IM injections.",0
"Oropharynx pain, discomfort, and economic impact of transesophageal echocardiography for planned radio-frequency catheter ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation: A cross-sectional survey study.","BACKGROUND: To survey the unmet medical needs associated with atrium thrombus screening in Chinese patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) for planned radio-frequency catheter ablation (RFCA). METHODS: This cross-sectional survey study interviewed 300 patients who underwent their first TEE for planned RFCA. The surveyed information included patients' anxiety, oropharynx pain and discomfort, time expense, and patient satisfaction related to TEE examination. Patient preference for a new atrium thrombus screening technology, hospital length of stay (LOS) of RFCA, and hospital costs of RFCA in these surveyed patients were collected as well. Descriptive statistical methods were used to summarize the collected survey information. RESULTS: Of the 300 interviewed patients, 36.3% reported anxiety before TEE examination, 58.6% reported oropharynx pain related to TEE, and 76.2% reported oropharynx discomforts, mainly including foreign body sensation (54.3%), dry heaves (33.8%), nausea (31.9%), and bleeding (22.9%). Even though 62.3% were satisfied with TEE, 84.3% preferred a new technology to replace TEE. Conducting outpatient TEE took more wait time (4.4 days vs. 0.1 days, p = 0.016) but led to significantly shorter hospital LOS (3.8 days vs. 6.4 days, p < 0.001) and significant lower hospital costs for RFCA (¥74,097 vs. ¥85,843, p < 0.001) than conducting inpatient TEE. CONCLUSIONS: Most AF patients experienced oropharynx pain and discomfort during or after TEE. Although more than half of AF patients were satisfied with TEE, most AF patients preferred a new technology to replace TEE for atrium thrombus screening. TEE was associated with economic impact on RFCA irrespective of TEE conducting settings.",0
Variation in seizure risk increases from antiseizure medication withdrawal among patients with well-controlled epilepsy: A pooled analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Guidelines suggest considering antiseizure medication (ASM) discontinuation in seizure-free patients with epilepsy. Past work has poorly explored how discontinuation effects vary between patients. We evaluated (1) what factors modify the influence of discontinuation on seizure risk; and (2) the range of seizure risk increase due to discontinuation across low- versus high-risk patients. METHODS: We pooled three datasets including seizure-free patients who did and did not discontinue ASMs. We conducted time-to-first-seizure analyses. First, we evaluated what individual patient factors modified the relative effect of ASM discontinuation on seizure risk via interaction terms. Then, we assessed the distribution of 2-year risk increase as predicted by our adjusted logistic regressions. RESULTS: We included 1626 patients, of whom 678 (42%) planned to discontinue all ASMs. The mean predicted 2-year seizure risk was 43% [95% confidence interval (CI) 39%-46%] for discontinuation versus 21% (95% CI 19%-24%) for continuation. The mean 2-year absolute seizure risk increase was 21% (95% CI 18%-26%). No individual interaction term was significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. The median [interquartile range (IQR)] risk increase across patients was 19% (IQR 14%-24%; range 7%-37%). Results were unchanged when restricting analyses to only the two RCTs. SIGNIFICANCE: No single patient factor significantly modified the influence of discontinuation on seizure risk, although we captured how absolute risk increases change for patients that are at low versus high risk. Patients should likely continue ASMs if even a 7% 2-year increase in the chance of any more seizures would be too much and should likely discontinue ASMs if even a 37% risk increase would be too little. In between these extremes, individualized risk calculation and a careful understanding of patient preferences are critical. Future work will further develop a two-armed individualized seizure risk calculator and contextualize seizure risk thresholds below which to consider discontinuation. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Understanding how much antiseizure medications (ASMs) decrease seizure risk is an important part of determining which patients with epilepsy should be treated, especially for patients who have not had a seizure in a while. We found that there was a wide range in the amount that ASM discontinuation increases seizure risk-between 7% and 37%. We found that no single patient factor modified that amount. Understanding what a patient's seizure risk might be if they discontinued versus continued ASM treatment is critical to making informed decisions about whether the benefit of treatment outweighs the downsides.",0
Bariatric Surgery for Adults With Class I Obesity and Difficult-to-Manage Type 2 Diabetes: A Health Technology Assessment.,"BACKGROUND: Many individuals with type 2 diabetes are classified as either overweight or obese. A patient may be described as having difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes if their HbA1c levels remain above recommended target levels, despite efforts to treat it with lifestyle changes and pharmacotherapy. Bariatric surgery refers to procedures that modify the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with class II or III obesity, bariatric surgery has resulted in substantial weight loss, improved quality of life, reduced mortality risk, and resolution of type 2 diabetes. There is some evidence suggesting these outcomes may also be possible for patients with class I obesity as well. We conducted a health technology assessment of bariatric surgery for adults with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes, which included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding bariatric surgery, and patient preferences and values. METHODS: We performed a systematic clinical literature review. We assessed the risk of bias of each included study, using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized controlled trials, the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for cohort studies, and the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool for systematic reviews; we assessed the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature review and conducted a cost-utility analysis of bariatric surgery in comparison with nonsurgical usual care over a lifetime horizon from a public payer perspective. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding bariatric surgery for adults with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes in Ontario. To contextualize the potential value of bariatric surgery, we spoke with people with obesity and type 2 diabetes who had undergone or were considering this procedure. RESULTS: We included 14 studies in the clinical evidence review. There were large increases in diabetes remission rates (GRADE: Low to Very low) and large reductions in body mass index (GRADE: Low to Very low) with bariatric surgery than with medical management. Bariatric surgery may also reduce the use of medications for type 2 diabetes (GRADE: Low) and may improve quality of life for people with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes compared with medical management. (GRADE: Low)Our economic evidence review included 5 cost-effectiveness studies; none were conducted in a Canadian setting, and 4 were considered partially applicable to our research question. Most studies found bariatric surgery to be cost-effective compared to standard care for patients with class I obesity and type 2 diabetes; however, the applicability of these results to the Ontario context is uncertain due to potential differences in clinical practice, resource utilization, and unit costs.Our primary economic evaluation found that over a lifetime horizon, bariatric surgery was more costly (incremental cost: $8,151 per person) but also more effective than current usual care (led to a 0.339 quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gain per person). The cost increase was driven by costs associated with surgery (before, after, and during surgery), and the QALY gain was due to life-years gained. Results were sensitive to the bariatric surgery cost and assumptions regarding its long-term benefits with respect to weight loss and diabetes remission.Publicly funding 50 bariatric surgeries in year 1, and gradually increasing to 250 surgeries in year 5, for people with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes would lead to budget increases of $0.55 million in year 1 to $2.45 million in year 5, for a total of $7.63 million over 5 years.The people with obesity and type 2 diabetes with whom we spoke reported that bariatric surgery was generally seen as a positive treatment option, and those who had undergone the procedure reported positively on its value as a treatment to manage their weight and diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: For adults with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery may be more clinically effective and cost-effective than medical management. Compared with medical management in people with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery may result in large increases in diabetes remission rates, large reductions in BMI, and reduced medication use for type 2 diabetes, improved quality of life. Over a lifetime horizon, bariatric surgery led to a cost increase and QALY gain. Bariatric surgery can result in postsurgical complications that are not faced by those receiving medical management. The cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery depends on its long-term impacts on obesity-related and diabetes-related complications, which could be uncertain.Our budget impact analysis suggests that publicly funding bariatric surgery in Ontario for people with class I obesity and difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes would lead to a budget increase of $7.63 million over 5 years.For people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery was seen as a potential positive treatment option to manage their weight and diabetes.",0
Lessons from immunotherapies in multiple sclerosis.,"The improved understanding of multiple sclerosis (MS) neurobiology alongside the development of novel markers of disease will allow precision medicine to be applied to MS patients, bringing the promise of improved care. Combinations of clinical and paraclinical data are currently used for diagnosis and prognosis. The addition of advanced magnetic resonance imaging and biofluid markers has been strongly encouraged, since classifying patients according to the underlying biology will improve monitoring and treatment strategies. For example, silent progression seems to contribute significantly more than relapses to overall disability accumulation, but currently approved treatments for MS act mainly on neuroinflammation and offer only a partial protection against neurodegeneration. Further research, involving traditional and adaptive trial designs, should strive to halt, repair or protect against central nervous system damage. To personalize new treatments, their selectivity, tolerability, ease of administration, and safety must be considered, while to personalize treatment approaches, patient preferences, risk-aversion, and lifestyle must be factored in, and patient feedback used to indicate real-world treatment efficacy. The use of biosensors and machine-learning approaches to integrate biological, anatomical, and physiological parameters will take personalized medicine a step closer toward the patient's virtual twin, in which treatments can be tried before they are applied.",0
Mapping the experiences of people with advanced cancer across multiple cancer types-a scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Through the introduction of tumor agnostic therapies, people with metastatic cancer and their treating physicians are facing new treatment choices that have differing side effect and efficacy profiles from conventional chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: The present study undertakes a scoping review of research into the experiences of people with advanced or metastatic cancer across various solid tumor types with the goal of developing a tumor-agnostic conceptual model. DESIGN: Automated queries on three internet search engines were performed to identify qualitative interview studies that focused on people with metastatic cancer. No limits were imposed for dates nor location of studies. RESULTS: Of the 173 hits generated from the searches, 25 peer-reviewed papers were selected for the review with dates that ranged from 2007 to 2022. All papers originated from the USA, Europe, Australia, or Japan. Three major themes emerged that formed the basis for the tumor-agnostic conceptual model: symptoms, loss of autonomy, and adaptation/coping. CONCLUSIONS: The explication of the interplay between the physical and emotional symptoms experienced by those with advanced and metastatic cancer using a multi-tumor approach provides the potential to make generalizations about the needs of this population. An opportunity exists to potentially address these needs through matching patient needs and preferences with the characteristics of novel therapeutics. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: In the era of tumor agnostic therapies, the elicitation of patient preferences across the spectrum of anatomical origins has the potential to enhance shared decision making in the setting of metastatic disease.",0
Americans' Awareness of Access Changes and Utilization of Telehealth During COVID-19: A Survey in the United States.,"Background: We examine how and why Americans have experienced interrupted health care during the COVID-19 pandemic and measure awareness and usage of expanded benefits offered by health insurers and employers. We use an expanded concept of health literacy to include knowledge of access conditions and consider if patients' knowledge of the health system may relate to utilization of care. Methods: We conducted an online survey of 451 U.S. adults in September 2020, asking respondents about their health care experiences since March 1, 2020. This survey measured usage of medical care and awareness of the efforts made by government, private insurers, and employers to increase access to benefits such as telehealth services, well-being and mental health programs, and new prescription options. Results: The most common reasons cited for postponing or skipping medical appointments included fears over COVID-19 exposure, following local restrictions, or wanting to preserve resources for those with COVID-19. Our survey also finds that many Americans are largely unaware of whether they have access to expanded benefits implemented during the pandemic. Critically, respondents who recalled telehealth and prescription medication benefits being promoted were more likely to report using such benefits. Conclusion: This research suggests that greater attention to health literacy can help promote participation in the system by patients and has the potential to lead to improved health outcomes and greater adherence to treatment plans. Telehealth may offer patients increased opportunities to consult with their physicians for ailments that they might otherwise have delayed seeking care.",0
Exploring the Preferences of the Australian Public for Antibiotic Treatments: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: Identify Australian public preferences for antibiotic treatments in the context of antibiotic stewardship. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in Australia to investigate the importance of seven attributes associated with antibiotic treatments and related stewardship practices: contribution to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), treatment duration, side effects, days needed to recover, days before taking antibiotics, treatment failure and out-of-pocket costs. The DCE data were analysed using conditional logit, mixed logit and latent class conditional logit models. The relative importance of each attribute was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 1882 respondents completed the survey; the main study sample consist of 1658 respondents (mean age 48 years) who passed quality checks. All seven attributes significantly influenced respondents' preferences for antibiotic treatments. Based on the designed attribute levels in the DCE, on average, out-of-pocket costs (32.8%) and contribution to antibiotic resistance (30.3%) were the most important attributes, followed by side effects (12.9%). Days before starting medication was least important (3.9%). Three latent classes were identified. Class 1 (including respondents who were more likely to be older and more health literate; 24.5%) gave contribution to antibiotic resistance greater importance in treatment preferences. Class 2 (including respondents more likely to report poorer health; 25.2%) gave out-of-pocket costs greater importance. The remaining (50.4%), who were generally healthier, perceived side effects as the most important attribute. CONCLUSIONS: Despite concerted public awareness raising campaigns, our results suggest that several factors may influence the preferences of Australians when considering antibiotic use. However, for those more likely to be aware of the need to preserve antibiotics, out-of-pocket costs and limiting the contribution to antibiotic resistance are the dominant influence. Delays in starting treatment were not important for any latent class, suggesting public tolerance for this measure. These results could help inform strategies to promote prudent antibiotic stewardship.",1
Adherence and Persistence to Nusinersen for Spinal Muscular Atrophy: A US Claims-Based Analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic, neuromuscular disease caused by deletions and/or mutations in the survival of motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene leading to reduced SMN protein levels. Nusinersen, an intrathecally administered antisense oligonucleotide therapy that increases SMN protein levels, is approved for use in adult and pediatric patients with SMA. Data to inform real-world patient adherence and persistence to nusinersen are limited, with disparities in the population with SMA, study design, and results. The objective of this study is to characterize real-world nusinersen adherence and persistence in patients with SMA. METHODS: This retrospective study examined nusinersen adherence and persistence over a 2-year period in patients with SMA in the USA from the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus claims database. Patients were followed from the date of first evidence of nusinersen treatment (occurring after 1 July 2017) until the end of the study period (31 December 2019) or end of continuous pharmacy and medical benefit enrollment, whichever came first. Subgroup analyses for nusinersen adherence and persistence were performed on the basis of age and presence or absence of spinal complications. RESULTS: The final cohort consisted of 179 patients with SMA treated with nusinersen. Adherence to nusinersen treatment was 41% at 56 weeks and 39% at 104 weeks. In the base-case persistence analysis, there was a decrease in persistence before 6 months (67%) and further decline at 1 (57%) and 2 years (55%). Patients with spinal complication versus without had numerically higher persistence with nusinersen. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that adherence and persistence to nusinersen treatment appear low. Demographic (age ≥ 18 years) and clinical factors (no spinal complications) may contribute to nusinersen treatment discontinuation. Future research should explore possible reasons for low adherence and persistence to nusinersen treatment, such as clinical or logistical factors, patient preferences, and payer restrictions.",0

The impact of parent treatment preference and other factors on recruitment: lessons learned from a paediatric epilepsy randomised controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: In paediatric epilepsy, the evidence of effectiveness of antiseizure treatment is inconclusive for some types of epilepsy. As with other paediatric clinical trials, researchers undertaking paediatric epilepsy clinical trials face a range of challenges that may compromise external validity MAIN BODY: In this paper, we critically reflect upon the factors which impacted recruitment to the pilot phase of a phase IV unblinded, randomised controlled 3×2 factorial trial examining the effectiveness of two antiseizure medications (ASMs) and a sleep behaviour intervention in children with Rolandic epilepsy. We consider the processes established to support recruitment, public and patient involvement and engagement (PPIE), site induction, our oversight of recruitment targets and figures, and the actions we took to help us understand why we failed to recruit sufficient children to continue to the substantive trial phase. The key lessons learned were about parent preference, children's involvement and collaboration in decision-making, potential and alternative trial designs, and elicitation of stated preferences pre-trial design. Despite pre-funding PPIE during the trial design phase, we failed to anticipate the scale of parental treatment preference for or against antiseizure medication (ASMs) and consequent unwillingness to be randomised. Future studies should ensure more detailed and in-depth consultation to ascertain parent and/or patient preferences. More intense engagement with parents and children exploring their ideas about treatment preferences could, perhaps, have helped predict some recruitment issues. Infrequent seizures or screening children close to natural remission were possible explanations for non-consent. It is possible some clinicians were unintentionally unable to convey clinical equipoise influencing parental decision against participation. We wanted children to be involved in decisions about trial participation. However, despite having tailored written and video information to explain the trial to children we do not know whether these materials were viewed in each consent conversation or how much input children had towards parents' decisions to participate. Novel methods such as parent/patient preference trials and/or discrete choice experiments may be the way forward. CONCLUSION: The importance of diligent consultation, the consideration of novel methods such as parent/patient preference trials and/or discrete choice experiments in studies examining the effectiveness of ASMs versus no-ASMs cannot be overemphasised even in the presence of widespread clinician equipoise.",0
Trends in the size of treated unruptured intracranial aneurysms over 35 years.,"OBJECTIVE: In the absence of clear guidelines and consistent natural history data, the decision to treat unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) is a matter of some controversy. Currently, decisions are often guided by a consensus of cerebrovascular specialist teams and patient preferences. It is unclear how paradigm-shifting developments in the detection and treatment of UIAs have affected the size of the UIAs that are selected for treatment. Herein, the authors aimed to study potential changes in the average size of the UIAs that were treated over time. They hypothesized that the average size of UIAs that are treated is decreasing over time. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was performed to identify all studies describing the size of UIAs that were treated using any modality. Scatter diagrams with trend lines were used to plot the size of the aneurysms treated over time and assess for the presence of a potentially significant trend via statistical correlation tests. Subgroup analyses based on type of treatment, country of study, and specialty of the authors were performed. RESULTS: A total of 240 studies including 35,150 UIAs treated between 1987 and 2021 met all eligibility criteria and were entered in the analysis. The mean age of patients was 55.5 years, and 70.7% of the patients were females. There was a significant decrease in the size of treated UIAs over time (Spearman's r = -0.186, p < 0.001), with a 0.71-mm decrease in the average size of treated UIAs every 5 years since 1987 and an annual mean dropping below 7 mm in 2012. This decreasing trend was present in surgically and endovascularly treated UIAs (p < 0.001 for both), in more developed and developing countries (p < 0.001 for both), within neurosurgical and non-neurosurgical specialties (p < 0.001 for both), most prominently in the US (Spearman's r = -0.482, p < 0.001), and less prominently in Europe (Spearman's r = -0.221, p < 0.001) and was not detected in East Asia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that based on the treated UIA size data published in the literature over the past 35 years, smaller UIAs are being treated over time. This trend is likely driven by safer treatments. However, future studies should elucidate the cost-effectiveness of treating smaller UIAs as well as the possible real-world contribution of this trend in preventing aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.",0
A novel framework for incorporating patient values and preferences in making guideline recommendations: guideline panel surveys.,"OBJECTIVE: Universally acknowledged standards for trustworthy guidelines include the necessity to ground recommendations in patient values and preferences. When information is limited-which is typically the case-guideline panels often find it difficult to explicitly integrate patient values and preferences into their recommendations. Our objective was to develop and evaluate a framework for systematically navigating guideline panels in incorporating patient values and preferences in making recommendations. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In the context of developing a guideline for colorectal cancer screening, we generated an initial framework for creating panel surveys to elicit guideline panelists' views of patient values and preferences and to inform panel discussions on recommendations. With further applications in guidelines of diverse topic areas, we dynamically refined the framework through iterative discussions and consensus. RESULTS: The finial framework consists of five steps for creating and implementing panel surveys. The surveys can serve three objectives following from the quantitative information regarding patient values and preferences that guideline panels usually require. An accompanying video provides detailed instructions of the survey. CONCLUSION: The framework for creating and implementing panel surveys offers explicit guidance for guideline panels considering transparently and systematically incorporating patient values and preferences into guideline recommendations.",0
Utilization of Hospital Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders in Older Adults During COVID-19 Surges in 2020.,"Background: Reports of poor outcomes among older adults with COVID-19 may have changed patient perceptions of Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) orders or caused providers to pressure older adults into accepting DNR orders to conserve resources. Objective: We determined early-DNR utilization during COVID-19 surges compared with nonsurge periods among nonsurgical adults ≥75 and its connection to hospital mortality. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among adults ≥75 years using the California Patient Discharge Database 2020. The primary outcome was early-DNR utilization. Control cohorts included nonsurgical adults <75 years in 2020 and nonsurgical adults ≥75 in 2019. Multiple causal inference methods were used to address measured and unmeasured confounding. Results: A total of 487,955 adults ≥75 years were identified, with 233,678 admitted during COVID-19 surges. Older adults admitted during surges had higher rates of early-DNR orders (30.1% vs. 29.4%, absolute risk differences = 0.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5-1.0) even after adjusting for patient case-mix (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.04). Patients with early-DNR orders experienced higher hospital mortality (15.5% vs. 4.8%, aOR = 3.96, 95% CI: 3.85-4.06). Difference-in-difference analyses demonstrated that adults <75 years in 2020 and adults ≥75 years in 2019 did not experience variation in early-DNR utilization. Conclusions: Older adults had slightly higher rates of early-DNR orders during COVID-19 surges compared with nonsurge periods. While the difference in early-DNR utilization was small, it was linked to higher odds of death. The increase in early-DNR use only during COVID-19 surges and only among older adults may reflect changes in patient preferences or increased pressure on older adults stemming from provider fears of rationing during COVID-19 surges.",0
Patients' preferences for systemic treatment of atopic dermatitis: safety and efficacy count the most.,"BACKGROUND: The advent of biologics and janus kinase inhibitors has revolutionized treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate preferences of patients with AD for attributes of currently approved systemic treatments and assess influencing factors. METHODS: An online discrete choice experiment was conducted in patients with AD throughout Germany to analyze preferences for outcome (probability of (almost) clear skin at week 16, probability of significant itch improvement, time to onset of itch relief and type of side effects) and process attributes (application method and frequency of laboratory tests). RESULTS: Participants (n = 182, 75.3% female) considered side effects (Relative Importance Score (RIS): 31.2), (almost) clear skin (RIS: 24.2) and probability of itch improvement (RIS: 16.0) most important. Application method (RIS: 14.4), time to onset of itch relief (RIS: 7.4) and frequency of laboratory tests (RIS: 6.8) were less relevant. Preferences were significantly influenced by sex, age, psychiatric comorbidity, current therapy and health-related quality of life according to multivariate regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Participants attached great importance to safety and symptom control. However, preferences were also dependent on individual characteristics, underscoring the importance of personal counseling. Conjoined with medical considerations, patients' preferences have fundamental impact on shared decisions for treatment of AD.",1
Limb salvage versus primary amputation in Gustilo-Anderson IIIB and IIIC tibial fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: The last systematic review on this topic was published in 2008. With advances in surgical techniques, patients with mangled extremities may now be potentially salvageable with comparable outcomes. This review aims to evaluate the outcomes of limb salvage compared to primary amputation in patients with severe open tibial fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search on PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, CENTRAL and CINAHL was performed from inception to 19 January 2022. The primary outcome was to evaluate clinical and functional outcomes. Secondary outcomes were to evaluate pain, patient preference, quality of life, and patient preferences. Methodological quality was evaluated using the MINORS criteria. Pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used as a summary statistic for dichotomous variables and continuous variables, respectively. RESULTS: Sixteen studies with 645 patients met inclusion criteria. The methodological quality was moderate based on the MINORS score. The majority were male. Mean age was 36.3 years. There was no significant differences in the length of hospitalization (n = 8), return to work rates (n = 9), return to sport rates (n = 4) and quality of life scores (n = 4). Patients with primary amputation had a significantly lower risk of total complications (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.08-0.53, p = 0.001) (n = 10), infections (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.85, p = 0.01) (n = 9), and number of surgeries (MD - 4.17, 95% CI - 6.49 to - 1.85, p = 0.0004) (n = 6). Patients with primary amputation were able to ambulate significantly earlier (MD - 4.06, 95% CI - 7.65 to - 0.46, p = 0.03) (n = 3). Three studies found a significantly higher cost of hospitalization in limb salvage patients. Functional outcomes were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: While patients with primary amputation had better clinical outcomes in the short-term, functional outcomes were not significantly different in both groups. Despite the heterogenicity of the results in this review, surgeons need to contextualize the decision making for their patients and incorporate these findings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.

Consumer preferences for telehealth in Australia: A discrete choice experiment.,"This study aims to elicit consumer preferences regarding telehealth and face-to-face consultations in Australia. It used a discrete choice experiment, presenting participants with a series of hypothetical choices, and based on their responses, infer what is most important to them. Data were analysed using conditional logit regression and latent class analysis. A total of 1,025 participants completed the survey, considering four different clinical scenarios. Face-to-face contacts were, on average, preferred to either telephone or video services. However, telehealth was identified as an attractive option if it prevents significant travel and can be conducted with a familiar doctor. Participants were strongly driven by cost, particularly greater than $30. Telehealth was least preferred for situations involving a new and unknown physical symptom, and relatively more preferred for surgical follow-up. The latent class analysis demonstrates only 15.9% of participants appeared unwilling to consider telehealth. The findings of this study suggest that meeting the needs of the Australian population requires a blended approach to service delivery, with telehealth being valued in a range of clinical scenarios. Price sensitivity was evident, therefore if telehealth services can be delivered with lower patient cost, then they are likely to be attractive.",1
Treatment Patterns of Cancer-associated Thrombosis in the Netherlands: The Four Cities Study.,"Background  Current guidelines recommend either low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as first-line treatment in cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE). Aim  This study aimed to investigate treatment regimens for cancer-associated VTE over the past 5 years, explore predictors for initial treatment (LMWH vs. DOAC), and to assess the risks of recurrent VTE and bleeding. Methods  This was a Dutch, multicenter, retrospective cohort study including consecutive patients with cancer-associated VTE between 2017 and 2021. Treatment predictors were assessed with multivariable logistic regression models. Six-month cumulative incidences for recurrent VTE and major bleeding (MB) were estimated with death as competing risk. Results  In total, 1,215 patients were included. The majority (1,134/1,192; 95%) started VTE treatment with anticoagulation: 561 LMWH (47%), 510 DOACs (43%), 27 vitamin K antagonist (2.3%), and 36 other/unknown type (3.0%). The proportion of patients primarily treated with DOACs increased from 18% (95% confidence interval [CI] 12-25) in 2017 to 70% (95% CI 62-78) in 2021. Poor performance status (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.99) and distant metastases (aOR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.82) were associated with primary treatment with LMWH. Total 6-month cumulative incidences were 6.0% (95% CI 4.8-7.5) for recurrent VTE and 7.0% (95% CI 5.7-8.6) for MB. During follow-up, 182 patients (15%) switched from LMWH to a DOAC, and 54 patients (4.4%) vice versa, for various reasons, including patient preference, recurrent thrombosis, and/or bleeding. Conclusion  DOAC use in cancer-associated VTE has increased rapidly over the past years. Changes in anticoagulation regimen were frequent over time, and were often related to recurrent thrombotic and bleeding complications, illustrating the complexity and challenges of managing cancer-associated VTE.",0
Patients' preferences in dental care: A discrete-choice experiment and an analysis of willingness-to-pay.,"INTRODUCTION: Dental diseases are a major problem worldwide. Costs are a burden on healthcare systems and patients. Missed treatments can have health and financial consequences. Compared to other health services, dental treatments are only covered in parts by statutory health insurance (SHI). Using the example of dental crowns for a cost-intensive treatment, our study aims to investigate whether (1) certain treatment attributes determine patients' treatment choice, and (2) out-of-pocket payments represent a barrier to access dental care. METHODS: We conducted a discrete-choice-experiment by mailing questionnaires to 10,752 people in Germany. In presented scenarios the participants could choose between treatment options (A, B, or none) composed of treatment attribute levels (e.g., color of teeth) for posterior (PT) and anterior teeth (AT). Considering interaction effects, we used a D-efficient fractional factorial design. Choice analysis was performed using different models. Furthermore, we analyzed willingness-to-pay (WTP), preference of choosing no and SHI standard care treatment, and influence of socioeconomic characteristics on individual WTP. RESULTS: Out of n = 762 returned questionnaires (response rate of r = 7.1), n = 380 were included in the analysis. Most of the participants are in age group ""50 to 59 years"" (n = 103, 27.1%) and female (n = 249, 65.5%). The participants' benefit allocations varied across treatment attributes. Aesthetics and durability of dental crowns play most important roles in decision-making. WTP regarding natural color teeth is higher than standard SHI out-of-pocket payment. Estimations for AT dominate. For both tooth areas, ""no treatment"" was a frequent choice (PT: 25.7%, AT: 37.2%). Especially for AT, treatment beyond SHI standard care was often chosen (49.8%, PT: 31.3%). Age, gender, and incentive measures (bonus booklet) influenced WTP per participant. CONCLUSION: This study provides important insights into patient preferences for dental crown treatment in Germany. For our participants, aesthetic for AT and PT as well as out-of-pocket payments for PT play an important role in decision-making. Overall, they are willing to pay more than the current out-of-pockt payments for what they consider to be better crown treatments. Findings may be valuable for policy makers in developing measures that better match patient preferences.",1
Willingness to provide informal care to older adults in Germany: a discrete choice experiment.,"As the German population is continually aging and the majority of older adults still wish to 'age in place', the need for informal care provided by family and friends will correspondingly continue to increase. In addition, while the need for formal (professional) care services is also likely to increase, the supply already does not meet the demand in Germany today. The aim of our study is the elicitation of people's willingness to provide informal care by means of a discrete choice experiment. The self-complete postal survey was disseminated to a random sample of the German general population in Lower Saxony. Data cleansing resulted in a final sample size of 280 participants. A conditional logit and a latent class model were estimated. All attributes were judged as highly relevant by the respondents. The results revealed that an increase in the care hours per day had the greatest negative impact overall on the willingness to provide informal care in our sample. The marginal willingness-to-accept for 1 h of informal care was €14.54 when having to provide informal care for 8 h in reference to 2 h per day. This value is considerably higher than the national minimum wage of €9.82. A three-class latent class model revealed preference heterogeneity. While a monetary compensation is often discussed to increase the willingness and availability of informal care in a country, our results show that this statement could not be generalized within our entire sample.",1
[Treatment of actinic keratoses in older adults].,"Actinic keratoses (AKs) are common precancerous skin lesions that primarily affect older adults due to cumulative sun exposure. Given the increased vulnerability of older adults to developing AKs, appropriate therapeutic strategies are crucial to prevent their progression to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. This comprehensive review aims to explore the various treatment modalities available for AKs in the elderly population, focusing on their efficacy, safety, and suitability for this specific age group. The article discusses topical treatments, cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy, chemical peels, and surgical interventions, providing a detailed analysis of their mechanisms of action, benefits, limitations, and considerations in geriatric patients. Furthermore, the importance of individualized treatment plans, considering factors such as comorbidities, medication interactions, and patient preferences, are highlighted.",0
[Do clothes make the psychiatrist? Psychiatrists and patients on psychiatrists' dress style and form of address].,"BACKGROUND: Both the way a psychiatrist dresses and the way he gets addressed can have an impact on the therapeutic relationship. Most psychiatrists have stopped wearing white coats and dress less formally than before. AIM: To identify psychiatrists&rsquo; and patients&rsquo; preferences regarding psychiatrists&rsquo; style of dress and form of address. To test if certain styles of dress are linked to competence or accessibility. METHODS: A total of 143 respondents, of which 35 psychiatrists and 108 patients, filled out structured questionnaires with pictures. RESULTS: Psychiatrists, and both minor and adult patients, preferred psychiatrists to dress formally while elderly patients prefer them to wear white coats. The formal dress style and white coat were perceived as more competent than the informal style. Psychiatrists thought a white coat is regarded less accessible than a formal dress style and a formal dress style less accessible than an informal one. Adult patients regarded a white coat as less accessible than formal and informal dress styles. In elderly and minor patients no differences were seen in perceived accessibility for the three dress styles. Both psychiatrists and patients preferred a psychiatrist to be addressed with &lsquo;doctor&rsquo; and a patient with his/her first name. CONCLUSIONS: It seems a good choice for a psychiatrist to go formally dressed, let them be addressed by their title, and address patients by their first name.",0
"""Shared decision-making"" for prostate cancer screening: Is it a marker of quality preventative healthcare?","BACKGROUND: ""Shared decision-making"" (SDM) is a cornerstone of prostate cancer (PCa) screening guidelines due to tradeoffs between clinical benefits and concerns for over-diagnosis and over-treatment. SDM requires effort by primary-care-providers (PCP) in an often busy clinical setting to understand patient preferences with the backdrop of patient risk factors. We hypothesized that SDM for PCa screening, given its prominence in guidelines and practical challenges, may be associated with quality preventative healthcare in terms of other appropriate cancer screening and encouragement of other preventative health behaviors. METHODS: From the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey, 50-75 year old men who underwent PSA screening were assessed for their participation in SDM, PCa and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, and other preventative health behaviors, like vaccination, exercise, and smoking status. Adjusted odds ratio of likelihood of PSA testing as a function of SDM was calculated. Likelihoods of SDM and PSA testing as a function of preventative health behaviors were also calculated. RESULTS: Screening rates were 62 % for PCa and 88 % for CRC. Rates of SDM were 39.1 % in those with PSA screening, and 16.2 % in those without. Odds of PSA screening were higher when SDM was present (AOR = 2.68). History of colonoscopy was associated with higher odds of SDM (AOR = 1.16) and PSA testing (AOR = 1.94). Health behaviors, like regular exercise, were associated with increased odds of SDM (AOR = 1.14) and PSA testing (AOR = 1.28). History of flu vaccination (AOR = 1.29) and pneumonia vaccination (AOR = 1.19) were associated with higher odds of SDM. Those who received the flu vaccine were also more likely to have PSA testing (AOR = 1.36). Smoking was negatively associated with SDM (AOR = 0.86) and PSA testing (AOR = 0.93). Older age was associated with higher rates of PSA screening (AOR = 1.03, CI = 1.03-1.03). Black men were more likely than white men to have SDM (AOR = 1.6, CI = 1.59 - 1.6) and decreased odds of PSA testing (AOR = 0.94, CI = 0.94 - 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: SDM was associated with higher odds of PSA screening, CRC screening, and other appropriate preventative health behaviors. Racial disparities exist in both SDM and PSA screening usage. SDM may be a trackable metric that can lead to wider preference-sensitive care and improved preventative care.",0
Perinatal mental health and COVID-19: Navigating a way forward.,"The COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath have increased pre-existing inequalities and risk factors for mental disorders in general, but perinatal mental disorders are of particular concern. They are already underdiagnosed and undertreated, and this has been magnified by the pandemic. Access to services (both psychiatric and obstetric) has been reduced, and in-person contact has been restricted because of the increased risks. Rates of perinatal anxiety and depressive symptoms have increased. In the face of these challenges, clear guidance in perinatal mental health is needed for patients and clinicians. However, a systematic search of the available resources showed only a small amount of guidance from a few countries, with a focus on the acute phase of the pandemic rather than the challenges of new variants and variable rates of infection. Telepsychiatry offers advantages during times of restricted social contact and also as an additional route for accessing a wide range of digital technologies. While there is a strong evidence base for general telepsychiatry, the particular issues in perinatal mental health need further examination. Clinicians will need expertise and training to navigate a hybrid model, flexibly combining in person and remote assessments according to risk, clinical need and individual patient preferences. There are also wider issues of care planning in the context of varying infection rates, restrictions and vaccination access in different countries. Clinicians will need to focus on prevention, treatment, risk assessment and symptom monitoring, but there will also need to be an urgent and coordinated focus on guidance and planning across all organisations involved in perinatal mental health care.",0
Using decision support tools for treatment decision making about antidepressants in outpatient psychiatric consultations.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the use of decision support tools in decision making about antidepressants during conversations between patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and their psychiatrists. METHODS: Theme-oriented discourse analysis of two psychiatric consultation groups: control (n = 17) and intervention (n = 16). In the control group, only a doctor's conversation guide was used; in the intervention group, the conversation guide and a patient decision aid (PDA) were used. RESULTS: Psychiatrists mainly dominated conversations in both consultation groups. They were less likely to elicit patient treatment-related perspectives in the intervention group as they focused more on delivering the information than obtaining patient perspectives. However, using PDA in the intervention group slightly encouraged patients to participate in decisional talk. CONCLUSION: The decision support tools did promote SDM performance. Using the conversation guide in both consultation groups encouraged the elicitation of patient perspectives, which helped the psychiatrists in tailoring their recommendations of options based on patient preferences and concerns. Using the PDA in the intervention group created space for treatment discussion and fostered active collaboration in treatment decision making. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Our findings have implications for SDM communication skills training and critical reflection on SDM practice.",0
"Robotic repair of moderate-sized midline ventral hernias reduced complications, readmissions, and length of hospitalization compared to open techniques.","PURPOSE: To compare outcomes of robotic and open repair for uncomplicated, moderate-sized, midline ventral hernias. METHODS: From 2017 to 2021, patient characteristics and 30 day outcomes for all ventral hernias at our center were prospectively collected. We studied hernias potentially suitable for robotic repair: elective, midline, 3-10 cm rectus separation, no prior mesh, and no need for concomitant procedure. Robotic or open repair was performed by surgeon or patient preference. The primary outcome was any complication using Clavien-Dindo scoring. Secondary outcomes were operative time, length-of-stay, and readmissions. Regression identified predictors of complications. RESULTS: Of 648 hernias repaired, 70 robotic and 52 open repairs met inclusion criteria. The groups had similar patient demographics, co-morbidities, and hernia size, except that there were more immunosuppressed patients in the open group (11 versus 5 patients, p = 0.031). Complications occurred after 7 (13%) open repairs versus 2 (3%) robotic repairs, p = 0.036. Surgical site infection occurred after four open repairs but no robotic repair, p = 0.004. Length-of-stay averaged almost 3 days longer after open repair (4.3 ± 2.7 days versus 1.5 ± 1.4 days, p = 0.031). Readmission occurred after 6 (12%) oppen repairs but only 1 (1%) robotic repair. A long-term survey (61% response rate after mean follow-up of 2.8 years) showed that the HerQLes QOL score was better after robotic repair (46 ± 15 versus 40 ± 17,  = 0.049). In regression models, only open technique predicted complications. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic techniques were associated with fewer complications, shorter hospitalization, fewer infections, and fewer readmissions compared to open techniques. Open surgical technique was the only predictor of complications.",0
Lessons Learned from Telemonitoring in an Outpatient Bariatric Surgery Pathway-Secondary Outcomes of a Patient Preference Clinical Trial.,"BACKGROUND: Remote monitoring is increasingly used to support postoperative care. This study aimed to describe the lessons learned from the use of telemonitoring in an outpatient bariatric surgery pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were assigned based on their preference to an intervention cohort of same-day discharge after bariatric surgery. In total, 102 patients were monitored continuously for 7 days using a wearable monitoring device with a Continuous and Remote Early Warning Score-based notification protocol (CREWS). Outcome measures included missing data, course of postoperative heart and respiration rate, false positive notification and specificity analysis, and vital sign assessment during teleconsultation. RESULTS: In 14.7% of the patients, data for heart rate was missing for > 8 h. A day-night-rhythm of heart rate and respiration rate reappeared on average on postoperative day 2 with heart rate amplitude increasing after day 3. CREWS notification had a specificity of 98%. Of the 17 notifications, 70% was false positive. Half of them occurred between day 4 and 7 and were accompanied with surrounding reassuring values. Comparable postoperative complaints were encountered between patients with normal and deviated data. CONCLUSION: Telemonitoring after outpatient bariatric surgery is feasible. It supports clinical decisions, however does not replace nurse or physician care. Although infrequent, the false notification rate was high. We suggested additional contact may not be necessary when notifications occur after restoration of circadian rhythm or when surrounding reassuring vital signs are present. CREWS supports ruling out serious complications, what may reduce in-hospital re-evaluations. Following these lessons learned, increased patients' comfort and decreased clinical workload could be expected. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifier: NCT04754893.",0
Patients' choice preferences for specialist outpatient online consultations: A discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Internet hospitals are multiplying with solid support from the Chinese government. In internet hospitals, specialist outpatient online consultations (SOOC) are the primary services. However, the acceptance and utilization rates of this service are still low. Thus, the study of patients' choice preferences for SOOC is needed. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the choice preference of patients' SOOC via a discrete choice experiment, understand the influence of each factor and promote the development of internet hospitals. METHODS: Via a discrete selection experiment, a total of 162 patients from two general hospitals and three specialized hospitals in Beijing were selected for the questionnaire survey. The choice preferences were analyzed by conditional logit regression. RESULTS: From high to low, patients' willingness to pay (WTP) for the attributes of SOOC is as follows: doctors' recommendation rate (β (highly recommend) = 0.999), the convenience of applying SOOC services (β (Convenient) = 0.760), the increasing ratio of medical insurance payment for online services compared to offline (β (Increase by 10%) = 0.545), and the disease's severity (β (severe) = -3.024). The results of the subgroup analysis showed differences in patient choice preference by age, whether the patients had chronic diseases, income, and medical insurance types. CONCLUSION: Both price and nonprice attributes influence the choice preference of SOOC for patients. Among them, patients are more inclined to choose SOOC when doctors highly recommend it, when it is convenient to apply, when medical insurance increases by 10%, and when disease severity is mild. The current findings show the government and medical institutions formulate auxiliary policies and welfare strategies by clarifying core attributes and adjusting the levels of different attributes to improve patients' acceptance of SOOC. The utility of SOOC and the further development of internet hospitals are radically promoted.",1
Primary health care during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative exploration of the challenges and changes in practice experienced by GPs and GP trainees.,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly changed general practice in the UK. Research is required to understand how General Practitioners (GPs) and GP trainees adjusted to these changes, so that beneficial changes might be sustained, and Primary Health Care (PHC) can be prepared for future challenges. This study explored the experiences and perspectives of GP and GP trainees during the pandemic. METHODS: Remote, semi-structured interviews (n = 21) were conducted with GPs (n = 11) and GP trainees (n = 10), recruited from across the UK using convenience and purposive sampling. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interview data were analysed with an inductive thematic approach. RESULTS: Five overarching themes were identified: (1) 'Thrown in at the deep end'; (2) Telemedicine: 'it needs to be a happy balance'; (3) Delayed referrals and 'holding' patients; (4) The Covid Cohort-training in Covid; (5) Suggestions and lessons for the future of general practice'. GPs reported a turbulent and uncertain time of major changes to PHC. They described the benefits of technology in general medicine, particularly telemedicine, when used in a balanced manner, highlighting the need for accompanying teaching and guidelines, and the importance of patient preferences. Key tools to help GPs manage patients with delayed referrals to Secondary Care were also identified. CONCLUSION: Several key changes to general practice occurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including a rapid uptake of telemedicine. The pandemic exposed the strengths and limitations of normal general practice and highlighted the importance of workplace camaraderie. These findings contribute to the evidence base used to adapt PHC infrastructures as we emerge from the pandemic.",0
Perceptions and drivers of healthcare provider and drug dispenser practices for the treatment of malaria in pregnancy in the context of multiple first-line therapies in western Kenya: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Emergence of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemether-lumefantrine in Africa prompted the pilot introduction of multiple first-line therapies (MFT) against malaria in Kenya, potentially exposing women-of-childbearing-age (WOCBAs) to anti-malarials with unknown safety profiles in the first trimester. This qualitative study explored knowledge and perceptions among healthcare providers providing malaria treatment to WOCBAs and pregnant women. METHODS: In-depth interviews were conducted with purposively selected public and private health facility (HF) and drug outlet (DO) providers within and outside the pilot-MFT area. County health managers were interviewed about their knowledge of the national treatment guidelines. Transcripts were coded by content analysis using the World Health Organization health system building blocks (leadership/governance, financing, health workforce, health information systems, access to medicines, and service delivery). RESULTS: Thirty providers (HF:21, DO:9) and three health managers were interviewed. Eighteen providers were from HFs in the pilot-MFT area; the remaining three and all nine DOs were outside the pilot-MFT area. The analysis revealed that providers had not been trained in malaria case management in the previous twelve months. DO providers were unfamiliar with national treatment guidelines in pregnancy and reported having no pregnancy tests. Health managers were unable to supervise DOs due to resource limitations. Providers from HFs and DOs noted poor sensitivity of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and hesitancy among patients who associated malaria-RDTs with HIV testing. Almost all providers reported anti-malarial stock-outs, with quinine most affected. Patient preference was a major factor in prescribing anti-malarials. Providers in HFs and DOs reported preferentially using artemether-lumefantrine in the first trimester due to the side effects and unavailability of quinine. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of malaria case management in drug outlets and health facilities remains poor. Improved regulation of DO providers is warranted. Optimizing treatment of malaria in pregnancy requires training, availability of malaria commodities, and pregnancy tests.",0

Fast-Track Pathway: An Effective Way to Boost Diabetic Foot Care.,"Diabetes is a chronic disease that challenges global health issues in many aspects. Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is one of the most common causes of reduced quality of life and increased hospitalization, amputation, treatment costs, and mortality in patients. Improper patients' knowledge, unsatisfactory education and training of healthcare workers, and limited facilities are the major cause of delayed referral and downscale management in DFUs. The diabetic foot clinical pathway is pivotal in providing best practices based on the latest standards and patient preferences. In the diabetic foot clinical pathway provided by the Iran Ministry of Health, the common concepts and grading systems are well defined for diabetic foot specialists so that patients can be diagnosed correctly and referred properly. Based on clinical examination guidelines, patients with diabetes are classified into low-risk, moderate-risk, high-risk, and active diabetic foot ulcer groups. One of this Pathway's main objectives is to prevent the patient from getting the first ulcer, prevent frequent recurrence ulcers, and most importantly, prevent minor and major amputation.",0
The Impact of Experience Versus Decision Aids on Patient Preference Toward Virtual Care.,"INTRODUCTION: Virtual care utilization has increased in recent years bringing questions of how to best inform patients regarding their use. Decision aids (DAs) are tools created to assist patients in making informed decisions about their health care. This study seeks to determine whether a DA or previous experience could better educate and influence patient's preference on virtual care. METHODS: One hundred fifty participants from an orthopedic clinic of a multi-hospital system were divided into three groups. Group 1 (Virtual Care Cohort) had at least one previous virtual care visit and was surveyed with the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ). Group 2 (In-person with Decision Aid) and Group 3 (In-person without Decision Aid) had no virtual care experience. Group 2 received a validated virtual care DA with a knowledge test. Both groups were also administered the TSQ. RESULTS: After the DA, patients improved their score on 3 of 4 virtual care knowledge questions. Each cohort demonstrated a positive perception of virtual care; however, the specific reasons for their favorable views varied. The DA cohort did not show increased preference toward virtual care compared with the non-DA group and only responded significantly higher regarding encounter comfort. Patients with previous experience in virtual care responded most favorably to the majority of survey questions regarding their virtual care preferences when compared with both virtual care naive cohorts. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We found that patient experience was the most important factor in influencing patient preference toward virtual care. Although the DA increased their virtual care knowledge it did not increase their preference; therefore, efforts should be placed at encouraging patient to experience virtual care.",0
"Impact of a moulded pureed diet on taste, appearance, recognisability, and overall liking among patients in an acute hospital.","INTRODUCTION: Hospital meals potentially influence patients' nutritional, physical, and emotional well-being during their admission. Patients on pureed diets report poorer meal satisfaction, due to taste, appearance, and recognisability, potentially impacting on their nutritional status. This study compared whether a moulded pureed diet made from modified maize starch led to improved taste, appearance, recognisability, and overall liking, compared to an unmoulded pureed diet made from potato starch in an acute hospital. METHODS: Patients on texture-modified diets were recruited and presented with two pureed diets - unmoulded and moulded. Participants were asked to identify meat and vegetable dishes prior to eating. After the meal, participants indicated their diet preference in terms of appearance, taste, and overall liking. RESULTS: 145 participants were recruited, of which 126 completed data collection. 86% correctly identified moulded meat dishes, 69% correctly identified moulded vegetable dishes, with an overall 77% accuracy in identifying moulded puree side dishes. On unmoulded puree side dishes, participants correctly identified 25% of meat dishes, 4% of vegetable dishes, with an overall accuracy of 14%. In terms of preference, the moulded puree was preferred, with 81% for appearance, 76% for taste and 75% for overall preference. When participants had differing preferences for appearance and taste (e.g., prefers unmoulded puree appearance and moulded puree taste), 95% of them subsequently aligned their overall preference with their taste preference (i.e., overall preferred moulded pureed diet). This suggests that taste has a stronger influence on overall preference compared to appearance. DISCUSSION: Findings indicate that a moulded pureed diet made from modified maize starch led to improved recognisability, taste, appearance, and overall liking compared to an unmoulded pureed diet made from potato starch. Taste had a stronger influence on overall preference compared to appearance. These findings capture patient preferences and may have implications on how hospital pureed diets may be improved, potentially improving patient nutrition and health outcomes.",0
The Patient preference predictor and the objection from higher-order preferences.,"Recently, Jardas et al have convincingly defended the patient preference predictor (PPP) against a range of autonomy-based objections. In this response, I propose a new autonomy-based objection to the PPP that is not explicitly discussed by Jardas et al I call it the 'objection from higher-order preferences'. Even if this objection is not sufficient reason to reject the PPP, the objection constitutes a pro tanto reason that is at least as powerful as the ones discussed by Jardas et al.",0
Identifying Barriers to Post-Acute Care Referral and Characterizing Negative Patient Preferences Among Hospitalized Older Adults Using Natural Language Processing.,"Our objective was to detect common barriers to post-acute care (B2PAC) among hospitalized older adults using natural language processing (NLP) of clinical notes from patients discharged home when a clinical decision support system recommended post-acute care. We annotated B2PAC sentences from discharge planning notes and developed an NLP classifier to identify the highest-value B2PAC class (negative patient preferences). Thirteen machine learning models were compared with Amazon's AutoGluon deep learning model. The study included 594 acute care notes from 100 patient encounters (1156 sentences contained 11 B2PAC) in a large academic health system. The most frequent and modifiable B2PAC class was negative patient preferences (18.3%). The best supervised model was Extreme Gradient Boosting (F1: 0.859), but the deep learning model performed better (F1: 0.916). Alerting clinicians of negative patient preferences early in the hospitalization can prompt interventions such as patient education to ensure patients receive the right level of care and avoid negative outcomes.",0
Which Factors Are Considered by Patients When Considering Total Joint Arthroplasty? A Discrete-choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: TKA and THA are major surgical procedures, and they are associated with the potential for serious, even life-threatening complications. Patients must weigh the risks of these complications against the benefits of surgery. However, little is known about the relative importance patients place on the potential complications of surgery compared with any potential benefit the procedures may achieve. Furthermore, patient preferences may often be discordant with surgeon preferences regarding the treatment decision-making process. A discrete-choice experiment (DCE) is a quantitative survey technique designed to elicit patient preferences by presenting patients with two or more hypothetical scenarios. Each scenario is composed of several attributes or factors, and the relative extent to which respondents prioritize these attributes can be quantified to assess preferences when making a decision, such as whether to pursue lower extremity arthroplasty. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: In this DCE, we asked: (1) Which patient-related factors (such as pain and functional level) and surgery-related factors (such as the risk of infection, revision, or death) are influential in patients' decisions about whether to undergo lower extremity arthroplasty? (2) Which of these factors do patients emphasize the most when making this decision? METHODS: A DCE was designed with the following attributes: pain; physical function; return to work; and infection risks, reoperation, implant failure leading to premature revision, deep vein thrombosis, and mortality. From October 2021 to March 2022, we recruited all new patients to two arthroplasty surgeons' clinics who were older than 18 years and scheduled for a consultation for knee- or hip-related complaints who had no previous history of a primary TKA or THA. A total of 56% (292 of 517) of new patients met the inclusion criteria and were approached with the opportunity to complete the DCE. Among the cohort, 51% (150 of 292) of patients completed the DCE. Patients were administered the DCE, which consisted of 10 hypothetical scenarios that had the patient decide between a surgical and nonsurgical outcome, each consisting of varying levels of eight attributes (such as infection, reoperation, and ability to return to work). A subsequent demographic questionnaire followed this assessment. To answer our first research question about the patient-related and surgery-related factors that most influence patients' decisions to undergo lower extremity arthroplasty, we used a conditional logit regression to control for potentially confounding attributes from within the DCE and determine which variables shifted a patient's determination to pursue surgery. To answer our second question, about which of these factors received the greatest priority by patients, we compared the relevant importance of each factor, as determined by each factor's beta coefficient, against each other influential factor. A larger absolute value of beta coefficient reflects a relatively higher degree of importance placed on a variable compared with other variables within our study. Of the respondents, 57% (85 of 150) were women, and the mean age at the time of participation was 64 ± 10 years. Most respondents (95% [143 of 150]) were White. Regarding surgery, 38% (57 of 150) were considering THA, 59% (88 of 150) were considering TKA, and 3% (5 of 150) were considering both. Among the cohort, 49% (74 of 150) of patients reported their average pain level as severe, or 7 to 10 on a scale from 0 to 10, and 47% (71 of 150) reported having 50% of full physical function. RESULTS: Variables that were influential to respondents when deciding on lower extremity total joint arthroplasty were improvement from severe pain to minimal pain (β coefficient: -0.59 [95% CI -0.72 to -0.46]; p < 0.01), improvement in physical function level from 50% to 100% (β: -0.80 [95% CI -0.9 to -0.7]; p < 0.01), ability to return to work versus inability to return (β: -0.38 [95% CI -0.48 to -0.28]; p < 0.01), and the surgery-related factor of risk of infection (β: -0.22 [95% CI -0.30 to -0.14]; p < 0.01). Improvement in physical function from 50% to 100% was the most important for patients making this decision because it had the largest absolute coefficient value of -0.80. To improve physical function from 50% to 100% and reduce pain from severe to minimal because of total joint arthroplasty, patients were willing to accept a hypothetical absolute (and not merely an incrementally increased) 37% and 27% risk of infection, respectively. When we stratified our analysis by respondents' preoperative pain levels, we identified that only patients with severe pain at the time of their appointment found the risk of infection influential in their decision-making process (β: -0.27 [95% CI -0.37 to -0.17]; p = 0.01) and were willing to accept a 24% risk of infection to improve their physical functioning from 50% to 100%. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that patients consider pain alleviation, physical function improvement, and infection risk to be the most important attributes when considering total joint arthroplasty. Patients with severe baseline pain demonstrated a willingness to take on a hypothetically high infection risk as a tradeoff for improved physical function or pain relief. Because patients seemed to prioritize postoperative physical function so highly in our study, it is especially important that surgeons customize their presentations about the likelihood an individual patient will achieve a substantial functional improvement as part of any office visit where arthroplasty is discussed. Future studies should focus on quantitatively assessing patients' understanding of surgical risks after a surgical consultation, especially in patients who may be the most risk tolerant. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Surgeons should be aware that patients with the most limited physical function and the highest baseline pain levels are more willing to accept the more potentially life-threatening and devastating risks that accompany total joint arthroplasty, specifically infection. The degree to which patients seemed to undervalue the harms of infection (based on our knowledge and perception of those harms) suggests that surgeons need to take particular care in explaining the degree to which a prosthetic joint infection can harm or kill patients who develop one.",1
The influence of multidisciplinary team meetings on treatment decisions in advanced bladder cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of specialised genitourinary multidisciplinary team meetings (MDTMs) in decision-making and identify factors that influence the probability of receiving a treatment plan with curative intent for patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data relating to patients with cT2-4aN0/X-1 M0 urothelial cell carcinoma, diagnosed between November 2017 and October 2019, were selected from the nationwide, population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry ('BlaZIB study'). Curative treatment options were defined as radical cystectomy (RC) with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy, chemoradiation or brachytherapy. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between MDTM factors and curative treatment advice and how this advice was followed. RESULTS: Of the 2321 patients, 2048 (88.2%) were discussed in a genitourinary MDTM. Advanced age (>80 years) and poorer World Health Organization performance status (score 1-2 vs 0) were associated with no discussion (P < 0.001). Being discussed was associated with undergoing treatment with curative intent (odds ratio [OR] 3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-4.9), as was the involvement of a RC hospital (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.09-2.65). Involvement of an academic centre was associated with higher rates of bladder-sparing treatment (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.31-3.21). Patient preference was the main reason for non-adherence to treatment advice. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with MIBC, the probability of being discussed in a MDTM was associated with age, performance status and receiving treatment with curative intent, especially if a representative of a RC hospital was present. Future studies should focus on the impact of MDTM advice on survival data.",0
Patient Preferences in the Treatment of Moderate-to-severe Atopic Dermatitis.,"Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease. A variety of systemic treatments are available for patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The efficacy, safety and administration profile of these treatments vary, and determining the optimal treatment strategy may require weighing the benefits and drawbacks of therapies with diverse characteristics. This study used an online discrete choice experiment survey to investigate treatment preferences among adults with atopic dermatitis from Denmark, France, the UK, or Canada. Participants were identified through existing online panels. The survey included questions regarding different treatment attributes, defined based on currently approved treatments for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Treatment preferences were measured as the relative importance of different treatment attributes. A total of 713 respondents met the inclusion criteria and completed the survey. The discrete choice experiment identified a significant preference for avoiding the risk of severe adverse events, and for oral pill every day compared with biweekly injections. The time to full effect was not rated as being important. These findings suggest that patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis prioritize safety as most important, followed by ease of administration in their treatment preferences, while time to full effect and monitoring requirements were the least important attributes.",1
Colorectal Cancer Screening in the Elderly: Does Increased Prevalence Necessitate Tighter Surveillance.,"BACKGROUND: With age, colorectal cancer (CRC) prevalence rises. The elderly (> 75 years), and the very elderly (> 85 years) are especially vulnerable. The advantages of screening must be assessed in the context of diminished life span and co-morbidities. OBJECTIVES: To compare CRC findings in colonoscopies that were performed following a positive fecal occult blood test/fecal immunochemical test (FOBT/FIT) in both elderly and very elderly age groups with those of younger patients. METHODS: We identified colonoscopies conducted between 1998 and 2019 following a positive stool test for occult blood in asymptomatic individuals. A finding of malignancy was compared between the two patient age groups. Furthermore, a sub-analysis was performed for positive malignancy findings in FOBT/FIT among patients > 85 years compared to younger than < 75 years. RESULTS: We compared the colonoscopy findings in 10,472 patients: 40-75 years old (n=10,146) vs. 76-110 years old (n=326). There was no significant difference in prevalence of CRC detection rate between the groups following positive FOBT/FIT (2.1% vs. 2.7%, P = 0.47). Similar results for non-significant differences were obtained in the sub-analysis compared to malignancy detection rates in the very elderly 0% (n=0) vs. 2.1% for < 75 years old (n=18), P = 0.59. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of CRC increases with age, no significant increase in the detection rate of CRC by FOBT was found in either the elderly or very elderly age groups. Screening colonoscopies in elderly patients should be performed only after careful consideration of potential benefits, risks, and patient preferences.",0
Adjuvant treatment decisions among adults aged 65 years and older with early-stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer seen in a simple multidisciplinary clinic versus standard consultation.,"INTRODUCTION: Randomized studies support de-escalation of adjuvant therapy for a target population of older adults ≥65 years with stage I, estrogen-receptor (ER) positive breast cancer after breast conserving surgery. We sought to evaluate the impact of a simplified multidisciplinary clinic (s-MDC) in this population by comparing treatment patterns and patient perceptions of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) and hormone therapy (HT) between patients seen in s-MDC vs. standard consultations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for patients in the above target population who underwent surgery between August 2020 and May 2022 at our institution. Two cohorts were included: (1) patients seen in s-MDC, and (2) patients seen in standard clinic separately by medical and radiation oncology (non-s-MDC cohort). The non-s-MDC patients declined, could not attend, and/or were not referred to the s-MDC. Patients in the s-MDC cohort were prospectively administered validated questionnaires to evaluate patient reported data including the Decision Autonomy Preference Scale (DAPS), e-Prognosis, and Medical Maximizing-Minimizing Scale (MMS). Chi square, t-tests, and non-parametric equivalents compared demographics, and logistic regression evaluated RT and HT use and survey score outcomes between cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 127 patients met inclusion criteria, with 33 s-MDC and 94 non-s-MDC patients. There was no difference between the cohorts in age, margin status, histology, grade, or focality. In the s-MDC cohort there were significantly more patients without sentinel lymph node biopsy (71.3% vs 42.4%, p = 0.003) and mean tumor size was smaller (0.69 vs. 0.96 cm, p < 0.003), and Charlson comborbidity index (CCI) was higher (5.21 vs 4.96, p = 0.038). There was no significant difference in receipt of RT (65% s-MDC vs 77% standard; odds ratio [OR] = 0.55, p = 0.189), HT (78% ss-MDC vs 72% standard; OR = 1.36, p = 0.513), or both (50% s-MDC vs 59% standard; OR = 0.7, p = 0.429). The s-MDC cohort was significantly more likely to undergo accelerated (vs. standard hypofractionated) RT (70% vs 39%; OR = 3.59, p = 0.020). In s-MDC patients with completed questionnaires (n = 33), all whose selected ""mostly patient (n=6)"" based decision making by DAPS chose RT while all ""mostly doctor (n=1)"" chose no RT. Based on e-Prognosis, there were lower odds of RT for increasing Schonberg score/ higher 10 yr mortality risk (OR 0.600, p = 0.048). MMS score ≥ 40 (""maximizer"") was strongly linked with the use of RT (OR 18.57, p = 0.011). DISCUSSION: For adults ≥65 years with early stage, ER positive breast cancer, s-MDC participation was not significantly associated with lower use of adjuvant RT or HT versus standard consultation but was significantly associated with shorter RT courses. DAPS and MMS results indicate that patient treatment preference may be predictable, highlighting an opportunity to tailor consultation discussions and recommendations based on intrinsic patient preferences and individual goals.",0
Patient preferences for the treatment of chronic cough: a discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic cough is common, negatively affects quality of life and has limited treatment options. Inhibition of purinergic signalling is a promising therapeutic approach but is associated with taste-related adverse effects. Little is known about treatment preferences from the perspective of patients with chronic cough, such as trade-offs between efficacy and side effect. METHODS: Patients with chronic cough completed an online discrete choice experiment survey in which they answered a series of questions requiring a choice between two constructed treatment options characterised by varying attribute levels. Selection of cough and taste-related attributes was informed by qualitative interviews and clinical trial data. Logit-based models were used to analyse resulting choice data. RESULTS: The discrete choice experiment survey was completed by 472 participants with chronic cough. Among study attributes, frequency of intense cough attacks was the most important to participants, followed by taste change, frequency of night-time coughing and frequency of daytime coughing. To accept the least preferred taste disturbance of a bitter, metallic, chalky or oily taste change, participants required either: (1) elimination of night-time cough along with a slight reduction in daytime cough; (2) elimination of daytime cough along with a pronounced reduction in night-time or (3) reduction in intense cough attacks from 7 to 2 times per week. Two distinct preference patterns were identified, each placing different importance on efficacy versus side effect trade-offs. CONCLUSIONS: Participants with chronic cough were willing to accept some taste disturbances in exchange for improved efficacy of chronic cough treatments. Knowledge of patient preferences can facilitate shared decision-making.",1
Patient choice: the shape of consent post-Montgomery.,"The law relating to consent and the process dentists need to go through to gain valid and informed consent to treat patients changed significantly following the landmark ruling of Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board. In this paper, we revisit the history of patient consent, give an update on the current legal situation in the UK, and produce a unique 'consent workflow' to aid in the process of gaining valid and informed consent to treat. The aim is to clarify the legal standing and provide a framework that dentists and other healthcare professionals can adapt to their current clinical practice while increasing the confidence of those involved in the consent process; both professionals and patients.",0
Nurses' work experiences in hospital wards with single rooms: An integrative review.,"AIM AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate evidence that examined nurses' work experiences in hospital wards with single rooms. The research question was 'What does the research tell us about nurses' work experiences in hospital wards with single rooms?' BACKGROUND: In the last decades, new hospital builds have moved towards including a high proportion of single rooms. Yet, single rooms create 'complex environments' that impact the nurses. DESIGN: A structured integrative review was undertaken of empirical evidence. METHODS: Original, peer-reviewed articles, written in English, were sourced from four databases: CINAHL, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. The initial searches were performed in April 2021 and repeated in December 2022. Quality appraisal was undertaken using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. A narrative synthesis approach was used to analyse the data. Reporting was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. RESULTS: Twelve studies, published between 2006 and 2022, with an international origin, and representing n = 826 nurses, were included in this review. The synthesis revealed mixed perspectives about nurses' work experiences in wards with single rooms. Whilst single rooms are 'all good in theory (and) a good idea', the reality was quite different. Synthesised findings are presented in four categories: (i) aesthetics and the physical space, (ii) privacy vs. isolation, (iii) safety, which includes situational awareness and (iv) communication and collaboration. CONCLUSION: This review describes how single rooms affects nurses' work experience. Whilst nurses shared multiple concerns about single rooms and the challenges they also acknowledged patient preference for the privacy and space afforded by single rooms. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Findings from this review highlight the need for careful planning to maintain and strengthen teamwork, prevent nurses' sense of working in isolation, as well as creating opportunities for mentorship, and collaboration among nurses when working in single-room settings.",0
Patient-Centered Quality Measures for Dialysis Care: A Report of a Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Scientific Workshop Sponsored by the National Kidney Foundation.,"Providing high-quality patient-centered care is the central mission of dialysis facilities. Assessing quality and patient-centeredness of dialysis care is necessary for continuous dialysis facility improvement. Based predominantly on readily measured items, current quality measures in dialysis care emphasize biochemical and utilization outcomes, with very few patient-reported items. Additionally, current metrics often do not account for patient preferences and may compromise patient-centered care by limiting the ability of providers to individualize care targets, such as dialysis adequacy, based on patient priorities rather than a fixed numerical target. Developing, implementing, and maintaining a quality program using readily quantifiable data while also allowing for individualization of care targets that emphasize the goals of patients and their care partners provided the motivation for a September 2022 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Workshop on Patient-Centered Quality Measures for Dialysis Care. Workshop participants focused on 4 questions: (1) What are the outcomes that are most important to patients and their care partners? (2) How can social determinants of health be accounted for in quality measures? (3) How can individualized care be effectively addressed in population-level quality programs? (4) What are the optimal means for collecting valid and robust patient-reported outcome data? Workshop participants identified numerous gaps within the current quality system and favored a conceptually broader, but not larger, quality system that stresses highly meaningful and adaptive measures that incorporate patient-centered principles, individual life goals, and social risk factors. Workshop participants also identified a need for new, low-burden tools to assess patient goals and priorities.",0
Eligibility test for advanced chronic kidney disease: Revision and proposal.,"Nowadays, chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence keeps increasing worldwide. The management of these patients usually requires renal replacement therapy (RRT). However, the complexity of patients' profiles comprises a great challenge to overcome. During the last decades, CKD units have been developed to offer multidisciplinary and coordinated attention to patients, helping in the decision-making of the RRT. Nevertheless, there is a huge variability in the performance and organization of care practice, implying an existing necessity to homogenize the RRT modality chosen. We propose a test composed of two parts: one to be completed by the medical staff (to evaluate contraindications for the different RRT techniques) and another by the patient or nursing staff (to consider patients' preferences). In this sense, it would be possible to have a common and useful tool to complement patient education in RRT, as well as sharing decision-making in the ACKD units taking into account patient preferences.",0
A new very-small-bore Simmons guiding sheath for transradial neurointervention: Technical note and initial experience.,"Transradial access during neurointerventions has increased in popularity because of reduced complications and patient preference. Nevertheless, transradial cannulation into the left common carotid artery can be difficult technically because of the lack of catheter support in the aortic arch. Furthermore, the use of large sheaths can increase the risk of complications at the access site. Here, we developed a new very-small-bore transradial system using a 3F Simmons guiding sheath, to increase the procedural success rate and minimize access-site complications. This system can represent a valuable treatment option for neurointerventions and has the potential to expand the indications for transradial access.",0
"European guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of breast lesions with uncertain malignant potential (B3 lesions) developed jointly by EUSOMA, EUSOBI, ESP (BWG) and ESSO.","INTRODUCTION: Breast lesions of uncertain malignant potential (B3) include atypical ductal and lobular hyperplasias, lobular carcinoma in situ, flat epithelial atypia, papillary lesions, radial scars and fibroepithelial lesions as well as other rare miscellaneous lesions. They are challenging to categorise histologically, requiring specialist training and multidisciplinary input. They may coexist with in situ or invasive breast cancer (BC) and increase the risk of subsequent BC development. Management should focus on adequate classification and management whilst avoiding overtreatment. The aim of these guidelines is to provide updated information regarding the diagnosis and management of B3 lesions, according to updated literature review evidence. METHODS: These guidelines provide practical recommendations which can be applied in clinical practice which include recommendation grade and level of evidence. All sections were written according to an updated literature review and discussed at a consensus meeting. Critical appraisal by the expert writing committee adhered to the 23 items in the international Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) tool. RESULTS: Recommendations for further management after core-needle biopsy (CNB) or vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) diagnosis of a B3 lesion reported in this guideline, vary depending on the presence of atypia, size of lesion, sampling size, and patient preferences. After CNB or VAB, the option of vacuum-assisted excision or surgical excision should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team and shared decision-making with the patient is crucial for personalizing further treatment. De-escalation of surgical intervention for B3 breast lesions is ongoing, and the inclusion of vacuum-assisted excision (VAE) will decrease the need for surgical intervention in further approaches. Communication with patients may be different according to histological diagnosis, presence or absence of atypia, or risk of upgrade due to discordant imaging. Written information resources to help patients understand these issues alongside with verbal communication is recommended. Lifestyle interventions have a significant impact on BC incidence so lifestyle interventions need to be suggested to women at increased BC risk as a result of a diagnosis of a B3 lesion. CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines provide a state-of-the-art overview of the diagnosis, management and prognosis of B3 lesions in modern multidisciplinary breast practice.",0
Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (ESG) Versus Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (LSG): A Comparative Review.,"Obesity is one of the most debilitating conditions. In a quest to mitigate disease severity, various interventions have been proposed, with endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) and laparoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (LSG) being among the recent interventions that have received growing attention. This systematic review sought to conduct a comparative analysis regarding the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of both interventions. The study involved a systematic review in which key search engines were used to select articles documented and published in the last decade. The articles for inclusion were those existing as peer-reviewed studies touching upon the aforementioned subject, with both controlled and uncontrolled trials included. Furthermore, there was the implementation of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol that governs systematic reviews, in which the article selection process entailed four key procedures in the form of identification, screening, determining eligibility, and the inclusion process. In the findings, the selected articles documented mixed outcomes, but a common denominator was that the safety profile of ESG tends to be superior to that of LSG due to the observations that ESG comes with fewer adverse events such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and severe nausea and vomiting. However, the majority of the studies contended that LSG proved superior to ESG in terms of effectiveness and efficacy. Hence, individuals with mild-to-moderate obesity are more likely to benefit from ESG, but those with severe obesity whose goal is to achieve long-term weight management might benefit more from LSG. In conclusion, the management of obesity and the decision to employ ESG or LSG ought to be patient-centered and dictated by factors such as patient preferences, safety, and the sustainability of the devised plan of care.",0
