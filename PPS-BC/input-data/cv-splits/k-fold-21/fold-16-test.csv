Improving methods of clinical practice guidelines: From guidelines to pathways to fast-and-frugal trees and decision analysis to develop individualised patient care.,"BACKGROUND: Current methods for developing clinical practice guidelines have several limitations: they are characterised by the ""black box"" operation-a process with defined inputs and outputs but an incomplete understanding of its internal workings; they have ""the integration problem""-a lack of framework for explicitly integrating factors such as patient preferences and trade-offs between benefits and harms; they generate one recommendation at a time that typically are not connected in a coherent analytical framework; and they apply to ""average"" patients, while clinicians and their patients seek advice tailored to individual circumstances. METHODS: We propose augmenting the current guideline development method by converting evidence-based pathways into fast-and-frugal decision trees (FFTs) and integrating them with generalised decision curve analysis to formulate clear, individualised management recommendations. RESULTS: We illustrate the process by developing recommendations for the management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). We converted evidence-based pathways for HIT, developed by the American Society of Hematology, into an FFT. Here, we consider only thrombotic complications and major bleeding. We leveraged the predictive potential of FFTs to compare the effects of argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) using generalised decision curve analysis. We found that DOACs were superior to other treatments if the FFT-predicted probability of HIT exceeded 3%. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed analytical framework connects guidelines, pathways, FFTs, and decision analysis, offering risk-tailored personalised recommendations and addressing current guideline development critiques.",0
Linking Patients' Goals and Priorities to Recommendations for Medication Changes in a Polypharmacy-Focused Structured Clinical Pathway.,"Polypharmacy is associated with poorer health outcomes in older adults. It is challenging to minimize the harmful effects of medications while maximizing benefits of single-disease-focused recommendations. Integrating patient input can balance these factors. The objectives are to describe the goals, priorities, and preferences of participants asked about these in a structured process to polypharmacy, and to describe the extent that decision-making within the process mapped onto these, signaling a patient-centered approach. This is a single-group quasi-experimental study, nested within a feasibility randomized controlled trial. Patient goals and priorities were mapped to medication recommendations made during the intervention. Overall, there were 33 participants who reported 55 functional goals and 66 symptom priorities, and 16 participants reported unwanted medications. Overall, 154 recommendations for medication alterations occurred. Of those, 68 (44%) recommendations mapped to the individual's goals and priorities, whereas the rest were based on clinical judgment where no priorities were expressed. Our results signal this process supports a patient-centered approach: allowing conversations around goals and priorities in a structured process to polypharmacy should be integrated into subsequent medication decisions.",0
Racial Disparity in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Treatment and Survival in the United States.,"INTRODUCTION: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has a higher incidence and prevalence than esophageal adenocarcinoma among Black individuals in the United States. Black individuals have lower ESCC survival. These racial disparities have not been thoroughly investigated. We examined the disparity in treatment and survival stratified by ESCC stage at diagnosis. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried to identify patients with ESCC between 2000 and 2019. The identified cohort was divided into subgroups by race. Patient and cancer characteristics, treatment received, and survival rates were compared across the racial subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 23,768 patients with ESCC were identified. Compared with White individuals, Black individuals were younger and had more distant disease during diagnosis (distant disease: 26.7% vs 23.8%, P < 0.001). Black individuals had lower age-standardized 5-year survival for localized (survival % [95% confidence interval]: 19.3% [16-22.8] vs 27.6% [25.1-30.2]), regional (14.3% [12-16.7] vs 21.1% [19.6-22.7]), and distant (2.9% [1.9-4.1] vs 6.5% [5.5-7.5]) disease. Black individuals were less likely to receive chemotherapy (54.7% vs 57.5%, P = 0.001), radiation (58.5% vs 60.4%, P = 0.03), and surgery (11.4% vs 16.3%, P < 0.0001). DISCUSSION: Black individuals with ESCC have a lower survival rate than White individuals. This could be related to presenting at a later stage but also disparities in which treatments they receive even among individuals with the same stage of disease. To what extent these disparities in receipt of treatment is due to structural racism, social determinants of health, implicit bias, or patient preferences deserves further study.",0
Development of vaccines for Chagas disease (CRUZIVAX): stakeholders' preferences and potential impacts on healthcare.,"A vaccine for Chagas disease does not currently exist. This study aims to inform the development of two vaccines for the prevention and treatment of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and guide their pre-clinical phase up to clinical phase I. The three main objectives are: 1) to explore patients' and policy makers' preferences on the candidate vaccines in Argentina and Spain; 2) to investigate health-related quality of life of patients affected by Chagas disease; and 3) to assess the potential health provider savings associated with the vaccines, in terms of resource use and health care costs. Discrete choice experiments will be employed to estimate and characterize the theoretical demand for the vaccines and investigate patients' and policy makers' preferences. Health-related quality of life will be assessed using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Resources use and costs associated with Chagas disease will be investigated using information from the databases of the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona.",1
Do Patients Want to Be Involved in Their Carpal Tunnel Surgery Decisions? A Multicenter Study.,"PURPOSE: Carpal tunnel syndrome requires multiple decisions during its management, including regarding preoperative studies, surgical technique, and postoperative wound management. Whether patients have varying preferences for the degree to which they share in decisions during different phases of care has not been explored. The goal of our study was to evaluate the degree to which patients want to be involved along the care pathway in the management of carpal tunnel syndrome. METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter study of patients undergoing carpal tunnel surgery at 5 academic medical centers. Patients received a 27-item questionnaire to rate their preferred level of involvement for decisions made during 3 phases of care for carpal tunnel surgery: preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative. Preferences for participation were quantified using the Control Preferences Scale. These questions were scored on a scale of 0 to 4, with patient-only decisions scoring 0, semiactive decisions scoring 1, equally collaborative decisions scoring 2, semipassive decisions scoring 3, and physician-only decisions scoring 4. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients completed the survey between November 2018 and April 2019. Overall, patients preferred semipassive decisions in all phases of care (median score, 3). Patients preferred equally collaborative decisions for preoperative decisions (median score, 2). Patients preferred a semipassive decision-making role for intraoperative and postoperative decisions (median score, 3), suggesting these did not need to be equally shared. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome prefer varying degrees of involvement in the decision-making process of their care and prefer a semipassive role in intraoperative and postoperative decisions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Strategies to engage patients to varying degrees for all decisions during the management of carpal tunnel syndrome, such as decision aids for preoperative surgical decisions and educational handouts for intraoperative decisions, may facilitate aligning decisions with patient preferences for shared decision-making.",0
Patients' expectations of and experiences with psychosocial care needs in perioperative nursing: a descriptive study.,"BACKGROUND: Meeting inpatients' psychosocial care needs is essential for their wellbeing, recovery, and positive experiences. This study aimed to describe and compare surgical inpatients' subjective perceptions of the importance of fundamental psychosocial and overall care received. METHODS: A descriptive study with a convenient sample was conducted from September 2019 to April 2020. A total of 194 surgical inpatients from Norway and Denmark answered a perioperative user participation questionnaire on the day of discharge. The questionnaire was previously face- and content validated. The questionnaire assessed patients' sociodemographic characteristics and four dimensions of fundamental care domains: Psychosocial, Relational, Physical, and System level. This study reports the results from the psychosocial domain. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations were used to analyze background information variables. The congruency between participants' expectations of and experiences with psychosocial care is presented. RESULTS: The inpatients expected (and experienced) the healthcare personnel to treat them with respect and dignity, and to be involved and informed throughout their perioperative care. The average ratings regarding these aspects of psychosocial care needs were 72.1-93.8%. There was congruency between patients' perceptions of the subjective importance (SI) of psychosocial fundamental care and their perceived reality (PR) of care. Congruency between high SI and high PR ranged from 59.1 to 92.2%, and congruency between low SI and low PR ranged from 0 to 6.6%. Incongruency between SI and PR varied between 5.9 and 39.6% and was mainly related to higher PR than SI. We found no association between education level, sex, length of stay, age, and patient expectations of or experiences with psychosocial care needs. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical inpatients in Norway and Denmark experience respectful and dignified treatment, and they feel involved and informed in their perioperative care. It is important to include patient perspectives in further research to avoid missed care and disconnection between what patients prefer and what healthcare personnel plan to do. Understanding patient preferences might also lead to less stress and workload for healthcare personnel.",0
Rate and reasons for peritoneal dialysis dropout following haemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis switch: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Patient experiences and survival outcomes can be influenced by the circumstances related to dialysis initiation and subsequent modality choices. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the rate and reasons for peritoneal dialysis (PD) dropout following haemodialysis (HD) to PD switch. METHOD: This systematic review conducted searches in four databases, including Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (study ID: CRD42023405718). Outcomes included factors leading to the switch from HD to PD, the rate and reasons for PD dropout and mortality difference in two groups (PD first group versus HD to PD group). The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist and the GRADE tool were used to assess quality. RESULTS: 4971 papers were detected, and 13 studies were included. On meta-analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in PD dropout in the PD first group (OR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.61, 1.09; I(2) = 83%; P = 0.16), however, there was a statistically significant reduction in the rate of mortality (OR: 0.48; 95%CI: 0.25, 0.92; I2 = 73%; P = 0.03) compared to the HD to PD group. The primary reasons for HD to PD switch, included vascular access failure, patient preference, social issues, and cardiovascular disease. Causes for PD dropout differed between the two groups, but inadequate dialysis and peritonitis were the main reasons for PD dropout in both groups. CONCLUSION: Compared to the PD first group, a previous HD history may not impact PD dropout rates for patients, but it could impact mortality in the HD to PD group. The reasons for PD dropout differed between the two groups, with no statistical differences. Psychosocial reasons for PD dropout are valuable to further research. Additionally, establishing a consensus on the definition of PD dropout is crucial for future studies.",0
A multidisciplinary consensus statement on the optimal pharmacological treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). The addition of docetaxel or new hormone therapies (abiraterone, apalutamide, or enzalutamide) improves overall survival and is currently the standard of care. However, the decision on the specific regimen to accompany ADT should be discussed with the patient, considering factors such as possible associated toxicities, duration of treatment, comorbidities, patient preferences, as there is no sufficient evidence to recommend one regimen over the other in most cases. This paper summarizes the evidence on the management of mHSPC and provides consensus recommendations on the optimal treatment in combination with ADT in mHSPC patients, with special attention to the patient's clinical profile.",0
Differences in Preferences for Drug Therapy Between Patients with Metastatic Versus Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Systematic Literature Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Compared with early stages (eBC) metastatic BC (mBC) is incurable. In mBC, aggressive treatment may increase the duration of survival but may also cause severe treatment side effects. A better understanding how patients with BC value different aspects of drug therapy might improve treatment effectiveness, satisfaction and adherence. This systematic review aims to identify and summarise studies evaluating patient preferences for drug therapy of BC and to compare preferences of patients with eBC and mBC. METHODS: The systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The electronic databases PubMed and Web of Science were searched on 22 June 2023. All studies published to this point were considered. Original studies reporting patient preferences on BC drug therapy determined by any type of choice experiment were eligible. A narrative synthesis of the effect measures presented as relative importance ratings, trade-offs (required benefit to make a therapy worthwhile) or monetary values of the treatment attributes was reported for each study. Risk of bias assessment for individual studies was performed using the checklist for observational studies from the STROBE Statement and the checklist from 'Conducting Discrete Choice Experiments to Inform Healthcare Decision Making: A User's Guide'. The study protocol was registered at the PROSPERO database (CRD42022377031). RESULTS: A total of 34 studies met the inclusion criteria were included in the analysis evaluating the preferences of patients with eBC (n = 18), mBC (n = 10) or any stage BC (n = 6) on, for example, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, hormonal therapy or CKD4/6-inhibitors using different types of choice experiments. Regardless of the stage, most patients valued treatment effectiveness in terms of survival gains higher than potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Treatment cost, mode of administration, treatment regimen and monitoring aspects were considered as least important treatment attributes. In addition, preferences concerning 16 different types of ADRs were described, showing high heterogeneity within BC stages. Yet, comparable results across BC stages were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the stage, patients with BC consistently valued survival gains as the most important attribute and were willing to accept the risk of potential ADRs. Incorporating patient preferences in shared decision making may improve the effectiveness of interventions by enhancing adherence to drug therapy in patients suffering from BC.",1
How Physicians Tackle Internet-Misinformed Patients: Going Beyond Traditional Patient-Centered Communication - A Study Protocol.,"BACKGROUND: The proliferation of misleading and irrelevant health information on the Internet has become a significant public concern. Inappropriate use of online materials can cause harm to patients' health and quality of life. While close attention has been paid to health campaigns and education programs that aim to disseminate accurate health knowledge, the role of physicians, who directly communicate with patients in medical encounters and provide personalized information, has been overlooked. Therefore, this study focuses on physicians and their communication strategies with internet-misinformed patients (IMPs). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the communicative strategies physicians use to tackle IMPs and explore connections between physicians' communicative strategies and patient-centered communication. METHODS: Approximately 10 to 15 physicians from diverse cultural backgrounds, including Ticino (an Italian-speaking region in Switzerland), Milan and China will be interviewed. Interviews will be conducted in-person or online through video conferencing software programs. Physicians will be asked about their experiences with IMPs, communicative strategies for addressing patients' misconceptions, balancing patient preferences, decision-making obstacles, and envisioning an ideal relationship with them. A thematic analysis will be utilized to analyze data, employing a general inductive approach. DISCUSSION: The results will provide valuable insights into effective clinical communication strategies that address patients' misuse of internet materials and inform policymakers and healthcare providers about the limitations and applicability of patient-centered communication in the current digital era.",0
Describing settings of care in the last 100 days of life for cancer decedents: a population-based descriptive study.,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have described the settings cancer decedents spend their end-of-life stage, with none considering homecare specifically. We describe the different settings of care experienced in the last 100 days of life by individuals with cancer and how settings of care change as they approached death. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study from January 2013 to December 2017, of decedents whose primary cause of death was cancer, using linked population-level health administrative datasets in Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: Decedents 125,755 were included in our cohort. The average age at death was 73, 46% were female, and 14% resided in rural regions. And 24% died of lung cancer, 7% breast, 7% colorectal, 7% pancreatic, 5% prostate, and 50% other cancers. In the last 100 days of life, decedents spent 25.9 days in institutions, 25.8 days receiving care in the community, and 48.3 days at home without any care. Individuals who died of lung and pancreatic cancers spent the most days at home without any care (52.1 and 52.6 days), while individuals who died of prostate and breast cancer spent the least days at home without any care (41.6 and 45.1 days). Regardless of cancer type, decedents spent fewer days at home and more days in institutions as they approached death, despite established patient preferences for an end-of-life experience at home. CONCLUSIONS: In the last 100 days of life, cancer decedents spent most of their time in either institutions or at home without any care. Improving homecare services during the end-of-life may provide people dying of cancer with a preferred dying experience.",0
Roadmap for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension in the Middle East: Review of the 2022 EVIDENT Summit.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension are leading risk factors for death and disability in the Middle East. Both conditions are highly prevalent, underdiagnosed and poorly controlled, highlighting an urgent need for a roadmap to overcome the barriers to optimal glycaemic and blood pressure management in this region. This review provides a summary of the Evidence in Diabetes and Hypertension Summit (EVIDENT) held in September 2022, which discussed current treatment guidelines, unmet clinical needs and strategies to improve treatment outcomes for patients with T2DM and hypertension in the Middle East. Current clinical guidelines recommend strict glycaemic and blood pressure targets, presenting several treatment options to achieve and maintain these targets and prevent complications. However, treatment targets are infrequently met in the Middle East, largely due to high clinical inertia among physicians and low medication adherence among patients. To address these challenges, clinical guidelines now provide individualised therapy recommendations based on drug profiles, patient preferences and management priorities. Efforts to improve the early detection of prediabetes, T2DM screening and intensive, early glucose control will minimise long-term complications. Physicians can use the T2DM Oral Agents Fact Checking programme to help navigate the wide range of treatment options and guide clinical decision-making. Sulfonylurea agents have been used successfully to manage T2DM; a newer agent, gliclazide MR (modified release formulation), has the advantages of a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia with no risk of cardiovascular events, weight neutrality and proven renal benefits. For patients with hypertension, single-pill combinations have been developed to improve efficacy and reduce treatment burden. In conjunction with pragmatic treatment algorithms and personalised therapies, greater investments in disease prevention, public awareness, training of healthcare providers, patient education, government policies and research are needed to improve the quality of care of patients with T2DM and/or hypertension in the Middle East.",0
Preferences of pregnant individuals to undergo labor after one cesarean in southern China.,"BACKGROUND: Labor after cesarean (LAC) remains an optional delivery method among healthy pregnant individuals. Exploring women's attitudes, preferences, reasons for previous cesarean delivery, and the incentives underlying pregnant individuals' preferences could help us understand their choice of delivery mode. In this study we evaluated the preferences and attitudes of eligible pregnant women regarding participation in a LAC in Foshan, China. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 438 pregnant individuals with one prior cesarean delivery (CD) who attended their antenatal examination at a tertiary hospital in southern China, between November 1, 2018, and October 31, 2019. Information on demographic characteristics, obstetric data, preferences for LAC, and incentives for LAC were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 85.4% (374/438) of women preferred LAC if they did not have contraindications before delivery, whereas 12.3% (54/438) refused and 2.3% (10/438) were unsure. Participants reported that the most important factors affecting their willingness to undergo LAC were safety indicators (i.e., ""ability of hospitals to perform emergency cesarean delivery"" [score of 9.28 ± 1.86]), followed by accessibility indicators (i.e., ""priority bed arrangements"" [score of 9.17 ± 1.84]). Logistic regression analysis indicated that neonatal wellbeing with the prior CD was an independent influencing factor (OR = 2.235 [95%CI: 1.115-4.845], p = 0.024) affecting willingness to access LAC in the subsequent pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high preference for LAC among pregnant individuals without contraindications before delivery in southern China. Healthcare providers need to ensure access to LAC and increase pregnant individuals' LAC willingness through high-quality shared decsision-making in alignment with patient preferences.",0
A qualitative study of teleconsultation practices among French oncologists in a post-COVID-19 period.,"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted healthcare professionals to adapt and implement new tools to ensure continuity of patient care. Teleconsultation became the only option for some practitioners who had never used it previously and boosted its use for others who already used it. Several studies have reviewed the use of teleconsultation in oncology during the epidemic, but few have addressed its continued use and how practitioners view it in a post-epidemic period. The aim of this survey was to conduct a qualitative exploration of how oncologists use teleconsultation in their daily practice in a post-COVID 19 period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this qualitative study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with oncologists in France who utilized teleconsultation in the field of oncology during the COVID-19 period. The interview guide included questions on the interests and limitations of using teleconsultation in oncology, on reluctance to use it among oncologists, and invited participants to formulate proposals for more optimal use. RESULTS: Fourteen oncologists participated in the survey. Currently, 12% of the consultations of the surveyed practitioners are conducted via teleconsultation. Seven themes were identified in the analysis of the interviews: (a) The oncologist and teleconsultation; (b) Clinical motivations for using teleconsultation; (c) Comparison between teleconsultation and in-person consultation; (d) Advantages and disadvantages of teleconsultation; (e) Technical modalities of teleconsultation; (f) Role of Covid and confinement in the use of teleconsultation; (h) Epistemic judgments about teleconsultation. Optimal teleconsultation occurs when seamlessly incorporated into patient care, offering reduced patient inconvenience, and providing economic and environmental benefits. Although there's a lack of unified agreement in research literature regarding time efficiency, teleconsultation facilitates more customized patient monitoring and addresses the challenge of ""medical deserts"" nationally. Considering patient preferences is crucial when contemplating the use of teleconsultation. Predominantly, technical issues stand as the principal barriers to teleconsultation implementation. CONCLUSION: Even after the end of the health crisis, teleconsultation is still used in clinical practice. Recommendations for effective use are suggested.",0
Understanding Intraoperative Transfusion Decision-Making Variability: A Qualitative Study.,"There is evidence of significant intraoperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion variability that cannot be explained by case-mix, and may reflect unwarranted transfusions. The objective was to explore the source of intraoperative RBC transfusion variability by eliciting the beliefs of anesthesiologists and surgeons that underlie transfusion decisions. Interviews based on the Theoretical Domains Framework were conducted to identify beliefs about intraoperative transfusion. Content analysis was performed to group statements into domains. Relevant domains were selected based on frequency of beliefs, perceived influence on transfusion, and the presence of conflicting beliefs within domains. Of the 28 transfusion experts recruited internationally (16 anesthesiologists, 12 surgeons), 24 (86%) were Canadian or American and 11 (39%) identified as female. Eight relevant domains were identified: (1) Knowledge (insufficient evidence to guide intraoperative transfusion), (2) Social/professional role and identity (surgeons/anesthesiologists share responsibility for transfusions), (3) Beliefs about consequences (concerns about morbidity of transfusion/anemia), (4) Environmental context/resources (transfusions influenced by type of surgery, local blood supply, cost of transfusion), (5) Social influences (institutional culture, judgment by peers, surgeon-anesthesiologist relationship, patient preference influencing transfusion decisions), (6) Behavioral regulation (need for intraoperative transfusion guidelines, usefulness of audits and educational sessions to guide transfusion), (7) Nature of the behaviors (overtransfusion remains commonplace, transfusion practice becoming more restrictive over time), and (8) Memory, attention, and decision processes (various patient and operative characteristics are incorporated into transfusion decisions). This study identified a range of factors underlying intraoperative transfusion decision-making and partly explain the variability in transfusion behavior. Targeted theory-informed behavior-change interventions derived from this work could help reduce intraoperative transfusion variability.",0
Toenail Onychomycosis with or without Diabetes in Canada: Patient Treatment Preferences and Health State Utilities.,"BACKGROUND: Toenail onychomycosis affects approximately 6.7% of Canadians. Symptoms include nail discolouration/disfiguration and pain; psychosocial impacts contribute to reduced health-related quality-of-life. Comorbid diabetes increases the risk of complications and exacerbates burden. Treatment may include topical therapy and/or oral agents. PURPOSE: To understand toenail onychomycosis treatment preferences, and to quantify the impact of toenail onychomycosis, with or without diabetes, on patient well-being. METHODS: Adults living in Canada with self-reported, physician-diagnosed, toenail onychomycosis were recruited online. A discrete choice experiment was used to quantify treatment preferences. Scenarios were randomized; data were analyzed using conditional logit regression. Health state utilities were estimated using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3(®). Results were stratified by diabetes status and toenail onychomycosis severity; the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to assess between-group utility differences. RESULTS: Three-hundred thirteen participants with toenail onychomycosis were included (161 had comorbid diabetes; 61.3%, severe onychomycosis). The mean age was 57.7 years; 55.9% were male. Treatment attributes with statistically significant impacts on patient preferences were efficacy (odds ratio [OR],1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.05 per 1% increased treatment success), administration method (one pill versus topical nail lacquer reference, 1.14; 1.04-1.26; topical solution applicator versus reference: 1.15; 1.03-1.29), severe adverse events (0.85; 0.80-0.90 per 1% increased risk), and risk of potential pharmacodynamic (0.80; 0.76-0.85) and alcohol (0.93; 0.88-0.98) interactions; preferences were more pronounced for efficacy and avoiding severe adverse events among toenail onychomycosis patients with comorbid diabetes. The mean (95% CI) utility value was 0.73 (0.70-0.75) overall, and statistically significantly lower (p=0.02) for toenail onychomycosis patients with diabetes (0.70; CI, 0.66-0.73) than those without (0.76; CI, 0.72-0.79). CONCLUSION: Among patients with toenail onychomycosis, the presence of diabetes was associated with differing treatment-related preferences. Utility values for patients with toenail onychomycosis represent a significant decline from full health that is exacerbated by comorbid diabetes.",1
What drives researcher preferences for chemical compounds? Evidence from conjoint analysis.,"We investigated the attributes and attribute levels that affect researcher preferences for chemical compounds. We conducted a conjoint analysis on survey data of Korean researchers using chemical compounds from the Korean Chemical Bank (KCB). The analysis estimated the part-worth utility for each attribute's level, calculated relative importance of attributes, and classified user segmentation with different patterns. The results show that the structure database offers the highest part-worth utility to researchers, followed by high new functionality, price, screening service, and drug action data provided only by the KCB. Notably, researchers view the offer of a structured database and high new functionality as more important than other attributes in decision-making about research and development of chemical compounds. Furthermore, the results of segmentation analysis demonstrated that researchers have distinct usage patterns of chemical compounds: researchers consider structure database and high new functionality in cluster 1; and high new functionality and price in cluster 2, to be the most appealing. We discussed some policy and strategic implications based on the findings of this study and proposed some limitations.",0
"Preferences for preventive treatments for rheumatoid arthritis: discrete choice survey in the UK, Germany and Romania.","OBJECTIVE: To quantify preferences for preventive therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) across three countries. METHODS: A web-based survey including a discrete choice experiment was administered to adults recruited via survey panels in the UK, Germany and Romania. Participants were asked to assume they were experiencing arthralgia and had a 60% chance of developing RA in the next 2 years and completed 15 choices between no treatment and two hypothetical preventive treatments. Treatments were defined by six attributes (effectiveness, risks and frequency/route of administration) with varying levels. Participants also completed a choice task with fixed profiles reflecting subjective estimates of candidate preventive treatments. Latent class models (LCMs) were conducted and the relative importance of attributes, benefit-risk trade-offs and predicted treatment uptake was subsequently calculated. RESULTS: Completed surveys from 2959 participants were included in the analysis. Most participants preferred treatment over no treatment and valued treatment effectiveness to reduce risk more than other attributes. A five-class LCM best fitted the data. Country, perceived risk of RA, health literacy and numeracy predicted class membership probability. Overall, the maximum acceptable risk for a 40% reduction in the chance of getting RA (60% to 20%) was 21.7%, 19.1% and 2.2% for mild side effects, serious infection and serious side effects, respectively. Predicted uptake of profiles reflecting candidate prevention therapies differed across classes. CONCLUSION: Effective preventive pharmacological treatments for RA were acceptable to most participants. The relative importance of treatment attributes and likely uptake of fixed treatment profiles were predicted by participant characteristics.",1
Development of a discrete choice experiment questionnaire to elicit preferences by pregnant women and policymakers for the expansion of non-invasive prenatal screening.,"OBJECTIVE: An instrument for measuring intervention preferences applicable to both patients and policymakers would make it possible to better confront the needs of the supply and demand sides of the health care system. This study aimed to develop a discrete choice experiments (DCE) questionnaire to elicit the preferences of patients and policymakers. The instrument was specifically developed to estimate preferences for new conditions to be added to a screening program for fetal chromosomal anomalies. METHODS: A DCE development study was conducted. The methods employed included a literature review, a qualitative study (based on individual semi-structured interviews, consultations, and a focus group discussion) with pregnant women and policymakers, and a pilot project with 33 pregnant women to validate the first version of the instrument and test the feasibility of its administration. RESULTS: An initial list of 10 attributes was built based on a literature review and the qualitative research components of the study. Five attributes were built based on the responses provided by the participants from both groups. Eight attributes were consensually retained. A pilot project performed on 33 pregnant women led to a final instrument containing seven attributes: 'conditions to be screened', 'test performance', 'moment at gestational age to obtain the test result', 'degree of test result certainty to the severity of the disability', 'test sufficiency', 'information provided from test result', and 'cost related to the test'. CONCLUSION: It is possible to reach a consensus on the construction of a DCE instrument intended to be administered to pregnant women and policymakers. However, complete validation of the consensual instrument is limited because there are too few voting members of health technology assessment agencies committees to statistically ascertain the relevance of the attributes and their levels.",1
Fit for Purpose? The Suitability of Oral Health Outcome Measures to Inform Policy.,Oral health research and program evaluation should consider alternative outcome measures for population oral health other than the DMFT index.,0
Non-insulin Medications for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is predicted to affect 366 million people over the age of 65 years by the year 2030. As the understanding of the core defects associated with T2D advanced, researchers recognized management should target multiple defects in glucose metabolism. As a result, efforts to manage T2D focus on developing new drug therapies aimed at addressing each of the identified metabolic defects. Optimal treatment of T2D is necessary to decrease the risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, and vascular diseases. This article discusses non-insulin pharmacologic treatments for T2D that are guided by glycemic efficacy, safety profiles, effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk, tolerability, patient comorbidities, route of administration, patient preference, and cost.",0
Ethical Aspects of Prodromal Synucleinopathy Prognostic Counseling.,"Alpha-synucleinopathies can be identified in their prodromal phase, raising several ethical issues. In this review, we first provide definitions of prodromal α-synucleinopathies and discuss the importance of distinguishing between prodromes and risk factors. Next, we discuss the implications of a diagnosis of prodromal α-synucleinopathy and considerations regarding prognostic counseling in both clinical and research settings. We review available data on patient preferences regarding disclosure as well as providers' perspectives. We examine the pros and cons of disclosing a diagnosis of prodromal α-synucleinopathy, taking into consideration the differences between clinical and research settings. Asking about willingness to know in clinical and research settings and the shared decision-making process applied to prognostic counseling is discussed. Concerning research settings, ethical aspects regarding clinical trials are addressed. Availability of direct-to-consumer technologies will likely lead to novel contexts requiring prognostic counseling, and future neuroprotective or neuromodulating treatments may require further considerations on the timing, role, and importance of prognostic counseling. Recommendations on how to address ethical gaps should be a priority for patients, medical professional societies, and research workgroups. Ethical issues must be considered as an integral part of the overall clinical and research approach to prodromal synucleinopathies.",0
Respiratory Management of Patients With Neuromuscular Weakness: An American College of Chest Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline and Expert Panel Report.,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory failure is a significant concern in neuromuscular diseases (NMDs). This CHEST guideline examines the literature on the respiratory management of patients with NMD to provide evidence-based recommendations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An expert panel conducted a systematic review addressing the respiratory management of NMD and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence and formulating and grading recommendations. A modified Delphi technique was used to reach a consensus on the recommendations. RESULTS: Based on 128 studies, the panel generated 15 graded recommendations, one good practice statement, and one consensus-based statement. INTERPRETATION: Evidence of best practices for respiratory management in NMD is limited and is based primarily on observational data in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The panel found that pulmonary function testing every 6 months may be beneficial and may be used to initiate noninvasive ventilation (NIV) when clinically indicated. An individualized approach to NIV settings may benefit patients with chronic respiratory failure and sleep-disordered breathing related to NMD. When resources allow, polysomnography or overnight oximetry can help to guide the initiation of NIV. The panel provided guidelines for mouthpiece ventilation, transition to home mechanical ventilation, salivary secretion management, and airway clearance therapies. The guideline panel emphasizes that NMD pathologic characteristics represent a diverse group of disorders with differing rates of decline in lung function. The clinician's role is to add evaluation at the bedside to shared decision-making with patients and families, including respect for patient preferences and treatment goals, considerations of quality of life, and appropriate use of available resources in decision-making.",0
Patients' and informal caregivers' perspectives on self-management interventions for type 2 diabetes mellitus outcomes: a mixed-methods overview of 14 years of reviews.,"BACKGROUND: Self-management interventions (SMIs) are core components of high-quality care in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to identify and summarise the scientific evidence exploring the perspectives of patients with T2DM and their informal caregivers on outcomes of SMIs, and the key themes to enhance T2DM patient-centred care. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods overview of reviews. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, up to June 2021 for systematic reviews (SRs) exploring the perspectives of adults with T2DM and their informal caregivers, regarding self-management. Two reviewers conducted independently study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. We estimated the degree of overlap across SRs. We performed a qualitative analysis using a thematic synthesis approach. RESULTS: We identified 54 SRs, corresponding to 939 studies, with a slight overlap. Most SRs (47/54, 87%) were considered high quality. We developed summaries for 22 outcomes and identified six overarching themes: (1) diabetic identity; (2) accessing healthcare; (3) experience of care; (4) engagement with self-management; (5) outcomes awareness; and (6) challenges adhering to self-management. We found important variability in how patients with T2DM and their informal caregivers value critical outcomes influenced by the disease progression and several contextual factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings represent what matters most to patients with T2DM and their informal caregivers regarding outcomes of SMIs. Our results can facilitate the development and evaluation of SMIs, and guide decision-making in diabetes care, including the formulation of decisions and recommendations.",0
Research recruitment and consent methods in a pandemic: a qualitative study of COVID-19 patients' perspectives.,"BACKGROUND: Virtual data collection methods and consent procedures adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic enabled continued research activities, but also introduced concerns about equity, inclusivity, representation, and privacy. Recent studies have explored these issues from institutional and researcher perspectives, but there is a need to explore patient perspectives and preferences. This study aims to explore COVID-19 patients' perspectives about research recruitment and consent for research studies about COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory qualitative focus group and interview study among British Columbian adults who self-identified as having had COVID-19. We recruited participants through personal contacts, social media, and REACH BC, an online platform that connects researchers and patients in British Columbia. We analyzed transcripts inductively and developed thematic summaries of each coding element. RESULTS: Of the 22 individuals recruited, 16 attended a focus group or interview. We found that autonomy and the feasibility of participation, attitudes toward research about COVID-19, and privacy concerns are key factors that influence participants' willingness to participate in research. We also found that participants preferred remote and virtual approaches for contact, consent, and delivery of research on COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who had COVID-19 are motivated to participate in research studies and value autonomy in their decision to participate, but researchers must be sensitive and considerate toward patient preferences and concerns, particularly as researchers adopt virtual recruitment and data collection methods. Such awareness may increase research participation and engagement.",0
Patient Preferences for Investigating Cancer-Related Symptoms in Australian General Practice: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Striking the right balance between early cancer diagnosis and the risk of excessive testing for low-risk symptoms is of paramount importance. Patient-centred care must also consider patient preferences for testing. AIM: To investigate diagnostic testing preferences of the Australian public for symptoms associated with oesophagogastric (OG), bowel, or lung cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: One of three discrete choice experiments (DCEs) related to either OG, bowel, or lung cancer were administered to a nationally representative sample of Australians aged 40 and above. METHODS: Each DCE comprised three scenarios with symptom positive predictive values (PPVs) for undiagnosed cancer ranging from 1% to 3%. The numerical risk was concealed from participants. DCE attributes encompassed the testing strategy, GP familiarity, test and result waiting times, travel duration, and test cost. Preferences were estimated using conditional and mixed logit models. RESULTS: A total of 3013 individuals participated in one of three DCEs: OG (n=1004), Bowel (n=1006), and Lung (n=1003). Preferences were chiefly driven by waiting time, test cost followed by the test type. There was preference for more invasive tests. When confronted with symptoms carrying an extremely low risk (symptom PPV of 1% or less), participants were more inclined to abstain from testing. CONCLUSIONS: Access-related factors, particularly waiting times and testing costs, emerged as the most pivotal elements influencing preferences, underscoring the substantial impact of these systemic factors on patient choices regarding investigations.",1
Elevated end-of-life spending: A new measure of potentially wasteful health care spending at the end of life.,"OBJECTIVE: To construct a new measure of end-of-life (EoL) spending-the elevated EoL spending-and examine its associations with measures of quality of care and patient and physician preferences in comparison with the commonly used total Medicare EoL spending measures. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING: Medicare claims data for a 20% random sample of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients, from the health care quality data for 2015-2016, from the Hospital Compare and the Medicare Geographic Variation public use file, and survey data about patient and physician preferences. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed the elevated EoL spending measure as the differential monthly spending between decedents and survivors with the same one-year mortality risk, where the risk was predicted using machine learning models. We then examined the associations of the hospital referral region (HRR)-level elevated EoL spending with various health care quality measures and with the survey-elicited patient and provider preferences. We also examined analogous associations for monthly total EoL spending on decedents. DATA EXTRACTION METHODS: Medicare FFS patients who were continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A & B in 2015 and were alive as of January 1, 2016. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found a large variation in the elevated EoL spending across HRRs in the United States. There was no evidence of an association between HRR-level elevated EoL spending and established health care quality measures, including those specific to EoL care, whereas total EoL spending was positively associated with certain quality of care measures. We also found no evidence that elevated EoL spending was associated with patient preferences for EoL care. However, elevated EoL spending was positively and significantly associated with physician preferences for treatment intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that elevated EoL spending captures different resource use from conventional measures of EoL spending and may be more valuable in identifying potentially wasteful spending.",0
"Association of Race, Ethnicity, Insurance, and Language and Rate of Breast-Conserving Therapy Among Women With Nonmetastatic Breast Cancer at an Urban, Safety-Net Hospital.","INTRODUCTION: Breast-conserving therapy (BCT), specifically breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and adjuvant radiation, provides an equivalent alternative to mastectomy for eligible patients. However, previous studies have shown that BCT is underused in the United States, particularly among marginalized demographic groups. In this study, we examine the association between race, ethnicity, insurance, and language and rate of BCS among patients treated at an academic, safety-net hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 520 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer diagnosed and treated at an academic, safety-net hospital (2009-2014). We assessed eligibility for BCT and then differences in the rate of BCT among eligible patients by race, ethnicity, insurance, and language. Reasons for not undergoing BCT were documented. RESULTS: Median age was 60 y; 55.9% were non-White, 31.9% were non-English-speaking, 15.6% were Hispanic, and 47.4% were Medicaid/uninsured. Three hundred seventy one (86.3%) underwent BCS; within this group, 324 (87.3%) completed adjuvant radiation. Among patients undergoing mastectomy, 30 patients (36.7%) were eligible for BCT; within this group, reasons for mastectomy included patient preference (n = 28) and to avoid possible re-excision or adjuvant radiation in patients with significant comorbidities (n = 2). Eligibility for BCT varied by ethnicity (Hispanic [100%], Non-Hispanic [92%], P = 0.02), but not race, language, or insurance. Among eligible patients, rate of BCS varied by age (<50 y [84.9%], ≥50 y [92.9%], P = 0.01) and ethnicity (Hispanic [98.5%], Non-Hispanic [91.3%], P = 0.04), but not race, language, or insurance. CONCLUSIONS: At our safety-net hospital, the rate of BCS among eligible patients did not vary by race, language, or insurance. Excluding two highly comorbid patients, all patients who underwent mastectomy despite being eligible for BCT were counseled regarding BCS and expressed a preference for mastectomy. Further research is needed to understand the value of BCT in the treatment of breast cancer, to ensure informed decision-making, address potential misconceptions regarding BCT, and advance equitable care for all patients.",0
Patient Perspectives on the Burden and Prevention of Diabetes-Related Foot Disease.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to understand patient perspectives about the impact and prevention of diabetes-related foot disease (DFD). METHODS: An online survey was distributed to patients with a history of DFD during 2020. The survey was designed alongside clinical specialists and DFD patients and utilized the health belief model. It asked about the impact of DFD on health, perceptions on preventive strategies, perceived need for additional support, and patient preferences for telehealth in DFD management. Quantitative data were summarized descriptively and compared between groups. Open-text responses were analyzed using conceptual content analysis. RESULTS: Of 80 participants with a history of DFD, foot ulcers were the complication most often experienced, with over two-thirds having been admitted to hospital for a DFD-related issue and over one-third having a DFD-related amputation. Participants had ranging perceptions on the effect of DFD on health, from minimal to crippling. Those with previous severe DFD complications leading to hospital admission found a lack of mobility and independence the consequences of most concern. Using offloading footwear was perceived as very important for preventing DFD complications, although the use of offloading footwear was low, with participants citing issues relating to cost, comfort, appearance, and access to footwear as barriers to better adherence. Perceptions on telehealth were mixed, with many participants not having access to or being comfortable with the use of digital technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DFD require additional supports for effective prevention, including offloading footwear.",0
miRNAs as cornerstones in chronic lymphocytic leukemia pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance- An emphasis on the interaction of signaling pathways.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) accounts for the vast majority of cases of leukemia. Patients of advanced age are more likely to develop the condition, which has a highly varied clinical course. Consideration of illness features and preceding treatment sequence, as well as patient preferences and comorbidities, is necessary for selecting the appropriate treatment for the appropriate patient. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity to detect CLL early, monitor CLL patients, select the treatment responders, and reduce ineffective treatment, unwanted side effects, and unnecessary expenses. In both homeostasis and illness, microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) play a vital role as master regulators of gene expression and, by extension, protein expression. MiRNAs typically reduce the stability of mRNAs, including those encoding genes involved in tumorigenesis processes as cell cycle regulation, inflammation, stress response, angiogenesis, differentiation, apoptosis, and invasion. Due to their unique properties, miRNAs are rapidly being exploited as accurate biomarkers for illness detection, and medicines based on miRNA targets are finding widespread application in clinical practice. Accordingly, the current review serves as a quick primer on CLL and the biogenesis of miRNAs. In addition to providing a brief overview of the miRNAs whose function in the progression of CLL has been established by recent in vitro or in vivo research through articulating the influence of these miRNAs on a wide variety of cellular functions, including increased proliferative potential; support for angiogenesis; cell cycle aberration; evasion of apoptosis; promotion of metastasis; and reduced sensitivity to specific treatments.",0
Barriers to Optimal Clinician Guideline Adherence in the Management of Markedly Elevated Blood Pressure: A Qualitative Content Analysis of Electronic Health Records.,"IMPORTANCE: Hypertension poses a significant public health challenge. Despite clinical practice guidelines for hypertension management, clinician adherence to these guidelines remains suboptimal. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a taxonomy of suboptimal adherence scenarios for severe hypertension and identify barriers to guideline adherence. DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative content analysis using electronic health records (EHRs) of Yale New Haven Health System who had at least two consecutive visits between January 1, 2013, and October 31, 2018. SETTING: This was a thematic analysis of EHR data to generate a real-world taxonomy of scenarios of suboptimal clinician guideline adherence in the management of severe hypertension. PARTICIPANTS: We identified patients with markedly elevated blood pressure ([BP]; defined as at least 2 consecutive readings of BP ≥160/100 mmHg) and no prescription for antihypertensive medication within a 90-day of the 2(nd) BP elevation (n=4,828). We randomly selected 100 records from the group of all eligible patients for qualitative analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The scenarios and influencing factors contributing to clinician non-adherence to the guidelines for hypertension management. RESULTS: Thematic saturation was reached after analyzing 100 patient records. Three content domains emerged: clinician-related scenarios (neglect and diffusion of responsibility), patient-related scenarios (patient non-adherence and patient preference), and clinical complexity-related scenarios (diagnostic uncertainty, maintenance of current intervention and competing medical priorities). Through a metareview of literature, we identified several plausible influencing factors, including a lack of protocols and processes that clearly define the roles within the institution to implement guidelines, infrastructure limitations, and clinicians' lack of autonomy and authority, excessive workload, time constraints, clinician belief that intervention was not part of their role, or perception that guidelines restrict clinical judgment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study illuminates reasons for suboptimal adherence to guidelines for managing markedly elevated BP. The taxonomy of suboptimal adherence scenarios, derived from real-world EHR data, is pragmatic and provides a basis for developing targeted interventions to improve clinician guideline adherence and patient outcomes.",0
The Relative Importance of Factors That Applicants Weigh When Ranking Adult Reconstruction Fellowships as Well as Their Perspectives on Robotic-Assisted Arthroplasty.,"BACKGROUND: Orthopedic Surgery Fellowship programs offer highly specialized training that varies based on the training environment and surgical experience. Additionally, for Adult Reconstruction programs, robotic-assisted surgery exposure has been a widely discussed topic. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative value of various factors to Adult Hip and Knee Fellowship applicants, and their perceptions of robotic-assisted arthroplasty. METHODS: We surveyed 780 applicants who applied to our fellowship to matriculate in 2020 to 2024. We received 158 responses (20.3% response rate). We assessed factors concerning people and perceptions, logistics, salary and benefits, program reputation and curriculum, and surgical experience. Additionally, we surveyed fellows' attitudes toward using robotic surgery and its impact on patient outcomes. RESULTS: The highest-rated factors were Level of Hands-On Operative Experience (4.83), Revision Hip Volume (4.72), Revision Knee Volume (4.71), Multiple Surgical Exposures to the Hip (4.59), and Clinical Case Variety (4.59). Respondents who were postfellowship matriculation placed significantly more value on Exposure to Multiple Attendings with Surgical Diversity (P = .01), and Anterior Hip Volume (P = .04), and less value on Geographic Location (P = .04) and Patient-Specific Instrumentation (P = .02) than prematriculates. Overall, 65% of applicants plan to or currently use robotics, 7.6% do not, and 27.2% said ""Maybe"". Those who plan to or currently use robotics most cited procedure fidelity, patient-preference, and marketability as reasons to use robotics. CONCLUSIONS: Hands-on surgical experience and revision volume were the most important factors for fellowship applicants. Applicants placed lower importance on robotics exposure and their perspectives on robotics in their future practice were highly variable. Our results will inform fellowship programs and future applicants what previous applicants have valued in their training to help guide fellowship program structure, resource management, as well as recruitment.",0
Preference of young adults for COVID-19 vaccination in the United Kingdom: a discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine preferences for COVID-19 vaccinations in the young adult population in the United Kingdom (UK). METHOD: A discrete choice experiment survey was conducted in UK young adults. Participants were asked to choose between two hypothetical vaccines the one they preferred the most. Vaccines were defined by five attributes (effectiveness, risk of side effects, duration of protection, number of doses, confidence in available evidence), identified following a systematic literature review and qualitative interviews with 13 young adults. A random parameters logit model, a latent class model, and subgroup analyses were used to identify preferences. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-nine respondents were included (70% women, mean age 23 years). All five attributes significantly influenced respondents' vaccination decisions. Respondents valued higher effectiveness, lower risk of side effects, longer protection duration, and a smaller number of doses. Based on the range of levels of each attribute, vaccine effectiveness was the most important attribute (relative importance 34%), followed by risk of side effects (32%), and duration of vaccine protection (22%). CONCLUSIONS: The five investigated vaccine attributes appear to play an important role in young adults' decision-making process. Results of this study may help health authorities designing appropriate strategies in future vaccines campaigns in the younger UK population.",1
Acne characteristics in Latin American patients and the potential role of trifarotene.,"BACKGROUND: Individualization of treatment based on acne type and severity, location, disease burden, and patient preference is required to maximize efficacy, safety, and adherence to therapy. Latin American populations have unique attributes that must be considered as part of this process to improve clinical success and achieve patient goals. Acne is more common among patients with darker skin phototypes, in whom it is often associated with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring-the most important acne sequelae-potentially due to more frequent and more severe underlying inflammatory processes in this population. DISCUSSION: These data argue for an early and proactive approach to managing acne in these patients with agents that target the inflammatory processes that underlie acne and its sequelae. As a class, retinoids offer a spectrum of activity that may be useful in addressing the unique needs of Latin American populations. CONCLUSION: Trifarotene, a novel, selective retinoid, has been evaluated in relevant patient populations.",0
Patient and Public Acceptance of Digital Technologies in Health Care: Protocol for a Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Strokes pose a particular challenge to the health care system. Although stroke-related mortality has declined in recent decades, the absolute number of new strokes (incidence), stroke deaths, and survivors of stroke has increased. With the increasing need of neurorehabilitation and the decreasing number of professionals, innovations are needed to ensure adequate care. Digital technologies are increasingly used to meet patients' unfilled needs during their patient journey. Patients must adhere to unfamiliar digital technologies to engage in health interventions. Therefore, the acceptance of the benefits and burdens of digital technologies in health interventions is a key factor in implementing these innovations. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the development of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to weigh criteria that impact patient and public acceptance. Secondary study objectives are a benefit-burden assessment (estimation of the maximum acceptable burden of technical features and therapy-related characteristics for the patient or individual, eg, no human contact), overall comparison (assessment of the relative importance of attributes for comparing digital technologies), and adherence (identification of key attributes that influence patient adherence). The exploratory objectives include heterogeneity assessment and subgroup analysis. The methodological aims are to investigate the use of DCE. METHODS: To obtain information on the criteria impacting acceptance, a DCE will be conducted including 7 attributes based on formative qualitative research. Patients with stroke (experimental group) and the general population (control group) are surveyed. The final instrument includes 6 best-best choice tasks in partial design. The experimental design is a fractional-factorial efficient Bayesian design (D-error). A conditional logit regression model and mixed logistic regression models will be used for analysis. To consider the heterogeneity of subgroups, a latent class analysis and an analysis of heteroscedasticity will be performed. RESULTS: The literature review, qualitative preliminary study, survey development, and pretesting were completed. Data collection and analysis will be completed in the last quarter of 2023. CONCLUSIONS: Our results will inform decision makers about patients' and publics' acceptance of digital technologies used in innovative interventions. The patient preference information will improve decisions regarding the development, adoption, and pricing of innovative interventions. The behavioral changes in the choice of digital intervention alternatives are observable and can therefore be statistically analyzed. They can be translated into preferences, which define the value. This study will investigate the influences on the acceptance of digital interventions and thus support decisions and future research.

Co-creation of the Global Patient Experience Data Navigator: a multi-stakeholder initiative to ensure the patient voice is represented in health decision-making.,"BACKGROUND: Putting patients' needs and priorities at the forefront of healthcare initiatives and medical product development is critical to achieve outcomes that matter most to patients. This relies on the integration of early, meaningful patient engagement (PE) to learn what is important to patients, and collection of representative patient experience data (PXD). The increased number of PE/PXD efforts across global regulatory, health technology assessment, and healthcare systems is an important step forward to deliver improved health outcomes for patients. However, these initiatives are fragmented and lack integration, which is necessary to maximize efforts and reduce burden on patients. To overcome these challenges, the Global Patient Experience Data Navigator has been co-created by Patient Focused Medicines Development to provide practical resources that can facilitate and optimize PXD generation, collection, analysis, and dissemination for patient benefit and aims to be applicable across all therapeutic areas for all stakeholders. METHODS: Co-creation of the Navigator took place through an iterative process of validation and formalization driven by a diverse, multi-stakeholder working group with individuals who have varying knowledge/experience in PE/PXD. RESULTS: A series of workshops took place to conduct a gap analysis, develop a taxonomy model, and integrate existing frameworks. The collective insights led to the development of the Navigator consisting of four specific tools in the form of downloadable templates, which can be used to: (1) prioritize outcomes that matter most to patients and their caregivers; (2) select appropriate measurement methods for these outcomes; (3) identify when and why PXD is used throughout the product development cycle for each stakeholder; (4) identify when and why PXD is used throughout the healthcare process for each stakeholder. A public consultation was carried out to collect user feedback before the Navigator was made publicly available in December 2022. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, the Global Patient Experience Data Navigator is the only publicly available toolkit developed with a multi-stakeholder and disease-agnostic approach providing taxonomically grouped resources to optimize the collection and collation of PXD for patient benefit. Future work will aim to further engage patients by adding a PE dimension to the Navigator.",0
Advance care planning-family carer psychological distress and involvement in decision making: the ACTION trial.,"OBJECTIVES: Facilitated advance care planning (ACP) helps family carers' to be aware of patient preferences. It can improve family carers' involvement in decision making and their overall experiences at the end of life, as well as, reduce psychological stress. We investigated the effects of the ACTION Respecting Choices (RC) ACP intervention on the family carers' involvement in decision making in the last 3 months of the patients' life and on the family carers' psychological distress after 3 months of bereavement. METHODS: Over six European countries, a sample of 162 bereaved family carers returned a bereavement questionnaire. Involvement in decision making was measured with a single item of the Views of Informal Carers-Evaluation of Services Short Form questionnaire. Psychological distress was measured with the Impact of Event Scale (IES). RESULTS: No significant effect was found on family carers involvement in decision making in the last 3 months of the patients' life (95% CI 0.449 to 4.097). However, the probability of involvement in decision making was slightly higher in the intervention arm of the study (89.6% vs 86.7%; OR=1.357). Overall, no statistical difference was found between intervention and control group regarding the IES (M=34.1 (1.7) vs 31.8 (1.5); (95% CI -2.2 to 6.8)). CONCLUSION: The ACTION RC ACP intervention showed no significant effect on family carers' involvement in decision making or on subsequent psychological distress. More research is needed about (1) how family carers can be actively involved in ACP-conversations and (2) how to prepare family carers on their role in decision making.

Meeting the Needs of Patient Preferences in Imaging.,"Healthcare continues to transition toward a patient-centered paradigm, where patients are active in medical decisions. Fully embracing this new paradigm means updating how clinical guidelines are formulated, accounting for patient preferences for medical care. Recently, several societies have incorporated patient preference evidence in their updated clinical practice guidelines, and patients in their expert panels. To fully transition to a patient-centered-paradigm, imaging organizations should rethink the formulation of clinical guidelines, accounting for patient preference evidence.",0
Should Antihypertensive Medications Be Routinely Administered in the Nighttime Instead of Daytime?,"The optimal timing for administering antihypertensive medications remains a topic of debate. This review examines the effectiveness of nighttime vs daytime administration of antihypertensive medications in controlling blood pressure (BP). The MAPEC and Hygia trials suggest that nighttime dosing achieves better BP control and significantly lowers cardiovascular events. However, concerns about methodology and generalizability have been raised. In contrast, the HARMONY and TIME trials found no significant difference in BP control nor cardiovascular outcomes between daytime and nighttime dosing. Current research suggests that the timing of antihypertensive medication administration may not be a crucial factor. Therefore, the decision about the timing of antihypertensive medications administration should be individualized, taking into account patient preference and clinical context, in order to promote consistent compliance.",0
Contemporary surgical and procedural management of benign prostatic hyperplasia.,"Interventions for benign prostatic hyperplasia have evolved from transurethral resection of the prostate and simple prostatectomy to a myriad of office-based and operating-room procedures. The contemporary approach involves matching the right procedure to the right patient, choosing on the basis of prostate characteristics, patient preference, and urologist expertise. This review details currently available and guideline-backed surgical and procedural treatments.",0
How do patients value features of biological medicine in rheumatoid arthritis? A discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to quantify the preference of the patients regarding biological DMARDs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients' preferences were assessed using a discrete choice experiment. Eighteen different surveys describing eight attributes were designed using experimental design methods. Each survey presented eight choice tasks with two options for patients to choose one. A conditional logit model was used to calculate relative importance and willingness to pay. Subgroup analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of the patients' characteristic on their preferences. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included in the study. All attributes had significant effects on the patients' choices. The most important feature was the ability to preserve physical function. The least important feature was the route of administration. Surprisingly, the out-of-pocket cost was one of the last priorities for respondents. According to the relative importance calculations, 80% of the patients' preferences can be obtained by clinical attributes. Based on subgroup analysis, the most important patient characteristic that affected their choices was the monthly out-of-pocket history. CONCLUSIONS: Different features of treatment had different effects on the patients' preferences. Quantification of the impact of each attribute not only revealed their relative importance but also determined the trade-off rate among them.",1
Study protocol for a cross-sectional online survey investigating patient preferences and experiences of waiting for elective cardiac surgery.,"INTRODUCTION: Being on a waiting list for elective (planned) cardiac surgery can be physically and psychologically challenging for patients. Research suggests that stress associated with waiting for surgery is dependent on different individual and contextual factors. However, most data on patients' experiences of waiting for surgery and preferences for waiting list management derives from non-cardiac clinical populations. The aim of the current study is to explore patients' experiences of being on a waiting list for elective cardiac surgery, and their views on how the waiting experience could be improved in the future. This work will inform the patient management strategy during the waiting period for surgery across the four major hospitals in London directly involved in this study, and potentially beyond by transferring learning to other services. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a mixed-methods study that will collect quantitative and qualitative data using a cross-sectional online survey. Patients who are on waiting lists for elective surgery across four major cardiac surgery departments in London hospitals, and are at least 18 years old, will be invited by their healthcare team via text message or letter to complete the survey. The target sample size of non-randomly selected participants will be 268. Bivariable and multivariable regression models will be used to assess associations between survey items measuring the impact of the cardiac condition on specific life domains (eg, daily activities, social and family relationships, hobbies, sexual life), anxiety and depression symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 and survey items evaluating experiences of health services. Data on experience and preferences for improvements to the waiting experience will be analysed with qualitative content analysis using an inductive approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was reviewed and granted ethical approval by the East of England-East Cambridge Research Ethics Committee. Findings from this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, a research website and social media and with an online event engaging patients, members of the public, healthcare professionals and other relevant stakeholders.

When should electronic medical records reminders for cancer screening stop?-Results from a national physician survey.,"BACKGROUND: Many older adults are screened for breast and colorectal cancers beyond guideline recommended thresholds. Electronic medical record (EMR) reminders are commonly used to prompt cancer screening. Behavioral economics theory suggests that changing the default settings for these reminders can be effective to reduce over-screening. We examined physician perspectives about acceptable thresholds for stopping EMR cancer screening reminders. METHODS: In a national survey of 1200 primary care physicians (PCP) and 600 gynecologists randomly selected from the AMA Masterfile, we asked physicians to choose whether EMR reminders for cancer screening should stop based on a list of criteria that included age, life expectancy, specific serious illnesses, and functional limitations. Physicians could choose multiple responses. PCPs were randomized to questions about breast or colorectal cancer screening. RESULTS: A total of 592 physicians participated (adjusted response rate 54.1%). 54.6% chose age and 71.8% chose life expectancy as criteria for stopping EMR reminders; only 30.6% chose functional limitations. Regarding age thresholds, 52.4% chose ages ≤75, 42.0% chose a threshold between 75 and 85, 5.6% would not stop reminders even at age 85. Regarding life expectancy thresholds, 32.0% chose ≥10 years, 53.1% chose a threshold between 5 and 9 years, 14.9% would not stop reminders even when life expectancy is <5 years. CONCLUSIONS: We found that many physicians would continue EMR reminders for cancer screening even in light of older age, limited life expectancy, and functional limitations. This may reflect reluctance to stop cancer screening and/or reluctance to stop EMR reminders so that physicians can retain control to decide for individual patients, for example, to assess patient preference and ability to tolerate treatment. There was consensus for stopping EMR reminders at ages 85+ and <5-year life expectancy. Interventions that seek to reduce over-screening by suppressing EMR reminders may be important for these groups but may have limited physician buy-in outside these thresholds.",0
Visual performance and patient preference with bilateral implantation of an extended depth of focus or combined implantation of an extended depth of focus/trifocal intraocular lens.,"PURPOSE: Evaluate postoperative visual performance in patients with bilaterally implanted AT LARA or AT LARA/AT LISA tri (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany) intraocular lenses. METHODS: Multicentered, comparative, open-label, retrospective/prospective study. Post-IOL implantation, patients were prospectively enrolled into this study; preoperative patient data were collected retrospectively. Follow-up was at 2-4 and 5-8 months post-surgery. The primary endpoint was binocular best corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA). The study was retrospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT05462067). RESULTS: Seventy-one patients (142 eyes) were enrolled; 67 patients (134 eyes) have 5-8 months data. The mean binocular CDVA at 2-4 months was -0.10 ± 0.06 logMAR in the bilateral AT LARA group (""bilateral"") and -0.11 ± 0.09 logMAR in the combined implantation AT LARA/ AT LISA tri group (""combined implantation""); (P = 0.4856). At 5-8 months, mean binocular CDVA was -0.13 ± 0.06 logMAR in the bilateral group and -0.11 ± 0.09 in the combined implantation group (P = 0.4003). At 5-8 months, more eyes in the bilateral group attained 0.2 logMAR or better binocular uncorrected intermediate VA (UIVA; 67 cm) than those in the combined implantation group (100% vs. 94%, respectively). The bilateral group achieved a mean of 0.24 ± 0.11 logMAR in uncorrected near VA (UCNVA), compared to a mean of 0.16 ± 0.12 logMAR in the combined implantation group at 5-8 months (P = 0.0041). CONCLUSIONS: A combined implantation approach (AT LARA in the distance dominant eye/AT LISA tri in the non-dominant eye) produced similar CDVA outcomes but better UCNVA as bilateral implantation with the AT LARA. UIVA was comparable between groups. No new safety concerns were reported.",0
Co-Design of an Evidence-Based Practice Continuing Education Course for Canadian Naturopathic Doctors.,"Objectives: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is a clinical decision-making process combining the best available scientific evidence with clinician expertise and patient preference. While EBP has been associated with a range of benefits, it is recognized that EBP is used suboptimally by a range of health professionals, including naturopathic doctors (NDs). Canadian NDs have expressed a high level of interest in opportunities to improve their EBP skills; however, barriers exist, including those that apply broadly to health professionals, and those that are unique to the naturopathic profession. The objective of the present project was to co-design an EBP continuing education (CE) course tailored to the needs and preferences of Canadian NDs. Design: These needs were solicited through the use of focus groups. Groups were stratified based on participants' use of evidence at baseline. The focus groups asked NDs about their definition of EBP, and their interest in an EBP course, including preferred content, and method of delivery. The focus group discussions were transcribed, and thematic analysis was completed. Subjects: Twenty-two Canadian NDs participated. Results: Participants reported a high level of understanding of EBP, a high level of interest in participating in an EBP course and provided actionable recommendations about course content and delivery. Some of the themes that emerged were consistent across the groups while others differed by stratification. Conclusions: The findings of this project will inform the development and evaluation of a future CE course.",0
Treatment of Granulomatous Inflammation in Pulmonary Sarcoidosis.,"The management of pulmonary sarcoidosis is a complex interplay of disease characteristics, the impact of medications, and patient preferences. Foremost, it is important to weigh the risk of anti-granulomatous treatment with the benefits of lung preservation and improvement in quality of life. Because of its high spontaneous resolution rate, pulmonary sarcoidosis should only be treated in cases of significant symptoms due to granulomatous inflammation, lung function decline, or substantial inflammation on imaging that can lead to irreversible fibrosis. The longstanding basis of treatment has historically been corticosteroid therapy for the control of granulomatous inflammation. However, several corticosteroid-sparing options have increasing evidence for use in refractory disease, inability to taper steroids to an acceptable dose, or in those with toxicity to corticosteroids. Treatment of sarcoidosis should be individualized for each patient due to the heterogeneity of the clinical course, comorbid conditions, response to therapy, and tolerance of medication side effects.",0

Mechanical Thrombectomy for Acute and Subacute Blocked Arteries and Veins in the Lower Limbs: A Health Technology Assessment.,"BACKGROUND: A blockage to the blood vessels in the lower extremities may cause pain and discomfort. If left unmanaged, it may lead to amputation or chronic disability, such as in the form of post-thrombotic syndrome. We conducted a health technology assessment of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) devices, which are proposed to remove a blood clot, which may form in the arteries or veins of the lower legs. This evaluation considered blockages in the veins and arteries separately, and included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding MT for lower limb blockages, patient preferences and values, and clinical and health system stakeholders' perspectives. METHOD: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Cochrane tool for randomized controlled trials or the risk of bias among non-randomized studies (RoBANS) tool for nonrandomized studies, and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature search. We did not conduct a primary economic evaluation since the clinical evidence is highly uncertain. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding MT treatment for inpatients with arterial acute limb ischemia and acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower limb in Ontario. To contextualize the potential value of MT, we spoke with people with acute DVT. To understand the barriers and facilitators of accessing MT, we surveyed clinical and health system stakeholders to gain their perspectives. RESULTS: We included 40 studies (3 randomized controlled trials and 37 observational studies) in the clinical evidence review. For patients who experience arterial acute limb ischemia, compared with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) alone, MT has greater technical success and patency and reduced hospital length of stay, but the evidence for these outcomes is uncertain (GRADE: Very low). Mechanical thrombectomy may reduce the volume of thrombolytic medication required and CDT infusion time (a determinant for intensive care unit [ICU] need) in patients experiencing acute DVT, but it is uncertain if this is to a meaningful degree (GRADE: Moderate to Very low). It may also reduce the proportion of people who experience post-thrombotic syndrome and overall hospital length of stay, but it is uncertain (GRADE: Very low).We estimated that publicly funding MT for people with arterial acute limb ischemia in Ontario would lead to an annual cost savings of $0.17 million in year 1 to $0.14 million in year 5, for a total savings of $0.83 million over 5 years. This cost savings was mainly attributed to reduced ICU stays among people who received MT, but the results had considerable uncertainty. For the population with acute DVT, publicly funding MT would lead to an additional cost of $0.77 million in year 1 to $1.44 million in year 5, for a total additional cost of $5.5 million over 5 years.The people with acute DVT with whom we spoke reported that MT was generally seen as a positive option, and those who had undergone the procedure reported positively on its value as a treatment to quickly remove a clot. Accessing treatment for DVT could be a barrier, especially in more remote areas of Ontario.Clinicians using the technology advised that facilitators to accessing the technology included perceived improvements in patient outcomes, resourcing requirements, addressing unmet needs, and avoidance of ICU stay. The main barrier identified was cost. Clinicians who were not using the technology advised that barriers were low case-use volume, along with costs for the equipment and for health human resources. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy may have greater technical success and patency and reduce hospital length of stay for patients experiencing an arterial acute limb ischemia and, for patients with an acute DVT, it may reduce CDT volume and infusion time, the proportion of people who experience post-thrombotic syndrome, and hospital length of stay. Mechanical thrombectomy may reduce the associated ICU costs, but it has higher equipment costs compared with usual care. Publicly funding MT in Ontario for populations with arterial acute limb ischemia may not lead to a substantial budget increase to the province. Publicly funding MT for acute DVT would lead to an additional cost of $5.5 million over 5 years. For people with acute DVT, MT was seen as a potential positive treatment option to remove the clot quickly. Overall, the majority of clinical stakeholders we engaged with (including both those with and without experience with MT) were supportive of the use of the technology.",0
[Geographical access to hemodialysis: an analysis of patient choices].,"INTRODUCTION: Patients do not always go to the facility closest to their home. DESCRIPTION: A study was carried out in Provence-Alpes Côtes d'Azur (PACA) on patients' preferences to mobilize the hemodialysis offer. METHODS: The data were extracted from the REIN Registry. Potential access was compared with actual access. A survey was carried out among a sample of patients travelling an additional distance of more than 25 km. RESULTS: About a quarter of the patients did not travel to the nearest facility. Of these, 16.3% travelled an additional distance of over 25 km. Patients' choices were determined by the relationship of trust with the team that first set up dialysis, followed by their desire to be followed in a multi-purpose facility. DISCUSSION: While distance remained the decisive factor, human factors were cited in the majority of cases to explain the bypass. CONCLUSION: The links between the first team and the next one should be strengthened.",0
Orthodontic Aligners: Current Perspectives for the Modern Orthodontic Office.,"Orthodontic aligners are changing the practice of orthodontics. This system of orthodontic appliances is becoming the mainstay appliance of choice for orthodontic offices in many countries. Patient preferences and lifestyle needs have made this appliance the primary choice when seeking care. In the early days, appliances lacked the efficiency and effectiveness of traditional bracket-wire systems, but modern systems are now able to handle a more comprehensive orthodontic caseload. Current systems provide newer biomechanical strategies and artificial intelligence-driven tooth movements for better outcomes. These improvements now mean that an orthodontist can be better prepared to manage a larger number of orthodontic malocclusions. This paper aims to discuss some of the evolution of orthodontic aligners and to describe to orthodontists the fundamentals of aligner therapy. In addition, it will provide an evidence-based outcome to the existing treatment outcomes in the current literature.",0
Patient preferences and comfort for cancer survivorship models of care: results of an online survey.,"PURPOSE: Workforce shortages will impact oncologists' ability to provide both active and survivorship care. While primary care provider (PCP) or survivorship clinic transition has been emphasized, there is little evidence regarding patient comfort. METHODS: We developed an online survey in partnership with patient advocates to assess survivors' comfort with PCP or survivorship clinic care and distributed the survey to online, cancer-specific patient communities from June to August 2020. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 975 surveys were complete. Most respondents were women (91%) and had private insurance (65%). Thirty-six cancer types were reported. Ninety-three percent had a PCP. Twenty-four percent were comfortable seeing a PCP for survivorship care. Higher odds of comfort were seen among respondents who were Black or had stage 0 cancer; female sex was associated with lower odds. Fifty-five percent were comfortable with a survivorship clinic. Higher odds of comfort were seen with lymphoma or ovarian cancer, > 15 years from diagnosis, and non-US government insurance. Lower odds were seen with melanoma, advanced stage, Medicaid insurance, and one late effect. Preference for PCP care was 87% for general health, 32% for recurrence monitoring, and 37% for late effect management. CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of cancer survivors were comfortable with PCP-led survivorship care and about half with a survivorship clinic. Most preferred oncologist care for recurrence monitoring and late-effect management. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Patient preference and comfort should be considered when developing survivorship care models. Future efforts should focus on facilitating patient-centered transitions to non-oncologist care.",0
Dietary Management of Eosinophilic Esophagitis.,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune-mediated food antigen-driven disease characterized by tissue eosinophilia and clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction. Medical and dietary therapies can be offered as treatment options in both pediatric and adult populations. Advances in nutritional research in EoE have produced different levels of dietary restriction, ranging from elimination of a single food group to more extensive restriction such as the two-food elimination diet, four-food elimination diet, or six-food elimination diet. Efficacy and outcomes vary for each level of restriction. The option of using dietary therapy allows clinicians to partner with patients in shared decision-making to balance the right level of food antigen restriction for the desired outcome. Key considerations when choosing dietary therapy hinge on patient preference and resources, food-related quality of life, and the ability to provide nutritional diversity and maintain nutritional parameters. This article highlights these considerations and offers clinical pearls to guide clinicians who wish to incorporate dietary therapy of EoE into their practice.",0
Cervical preparation for second-trimester procedural abortion.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the evidence-informed options for cervical preparation prior to second-trimester dilation and evacuation (D&E). RECENT FINDINGS: As abortion restrictions increase and the number of abortion clinics and providers decreases, pregnant people are facing more barriers to abortion access. Those in need are now often required to travel for second-trimester abortion care, only to be faced with additional restrictions, such as mandatory waiting periods. Cervical preparation is recommended prior to D&E and takes time for effect. Given the increasing time required to obtain an abortion, patients and providers may prefer same-day cervical preparation to decrease the total time required. Options for same-day cervical preparation include misoprostol alone with single or serial doses, and misoprostol combined with osmotic dilators or transcervical balloon (Foley catheter). Same-day preparation may require additional clinical space to accommodate people after initiation of cervical preparation to manage side-effects and timing of the abortion. Overnight options are also used and more frequently later in the second trimester. Overnight options include mifepristone, osmotic dilators, and transcervical balloon and are often combined with same-day misoprostol. Medication alone preparation is well tolerated and effective in the second trimester, with the addition of mechanical methods with advancing gestation. With many options and combinations being safe and effective, providers can be dynamic and alter approach with supply shortages, adjust to different clinical settings, consider patient medical and surgical factors, and accommodate provider and patient preferences. SUMMARY: Multiple pharmacologic and mechanical options have been shown to be safe and effective for cervical preparation prior to D&E. Consideration for multiple factors should influence the method of cervical preparation and methods may vary by patient, provider and setting.",0
"Duration of Follow-up and Timing of Discharge from Imaging Follow-up, in Adult Patients with Urolithiasis After Surgical or Medical Intervention: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis from the European Association of Urology Guideline Panel on Urolithiasi","CONTEXT: No algorithm exists for structured follow-up of urolithiasis patients. OBJECTIVE: To provide a discharge time point during follow-up of urolithiasis patients after treatment. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic review of PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, and reference lists according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. Fifty studies were eligible. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: From a pooled analysis of 5467 stone-free patients, we estimated that for a safety margin of 80% for remaining stone free, patients should be followed up using imaging, for at least 2 yr (radiopaque stones) or 3 yr (radiolucent stones) before being discharged. Patients should be discharged after 5 yr of no recurrence with a safety margin of 90%. Regarding residual disease, patients with fragments ≤4 mm could be offered surveillance up to 4 yr since intervention rates range between 17% and 29%, disease progression between 9% and 34%, and spontaneous passage between 21% and 34% at 49 mo. Patients with larger residual fragments should be offered further definitive intervention since intervention rates are high (24-100%). Insufficient data exist for high-risk patients, but the current literature dictates that patients who are adherent to targeted medical treatment seem to experience less stone growth or regrowth of residual fragments, and may be discharged after 36-48 mo of nonprogressive disease on imaging. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that stone-free patients with radiopaque or radiolucent stones should be followed up to 2 or 3 yr, respectively. In patients with residual fragments ≤4 mm, surveillance or intervention can be advised according to patient preferences and characteristics, while for those with larger residual fragments, reintervention should be scheduled. PATIENT SUMMARY: Here, we review the literature regarding follow-up of urolithiasis patients. Patients who have no stones after treatment should be seen up to 2-3 yr, those with large fragments should be reoperated, and those with small fragments could be offered surveillance with imaging.",0
Patient Preferences Regarding Surgical Treatment Methods for Symptomatic Uterine Fibroids.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to rank the factors that are most and least important to patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids when considering surgical treatment options. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a best worst scaling (BWS) preference elicitation approach, participants completed an online survey to rank factors associated with fibroid surgical treatments. Survey content was based on a literature review and included the following factors: symptom relief; surgical complications; repeat treatment; recovery time; cosmetic effects; risk of spreading undiagnosed cancer; sexual outcomes; maintenance of child-bearing; continuation of menses; unpredictable menses; and location of procedure. Participants completed 11 BWS tasks. For each task, we presented participants with a subset of 5 factors from the possible 11, and participants chose the most important and least important factor. Participants' responses were analyzed using conditional logistic regression to determine the relative importance of factors. Patient priorities were further explored via age and race. RESULTS: 285 respondents with symptomatic uterine fibroids (69 physician-confirmed and 216 self-reported) who had not undergone prior surgical treatment completed the survey. Respondents were enrolled from two clinical sites (clinical site cohort) and an online consumer panel (panel cohort). Both cohorts identified symptom relief, cancer risk, repeat treatment and complications as the most important factors in selecting surgical treatment options and location of procedure, return to normal activities after surgery, and cosmetic effects like presence of a scar after the surgical treatment as the least important factors. Of note, younger women (≤ 40) placed greater importance on the ability to have children after the procedure. CONCLUSION: Information regarding the factors most and least important to patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids might inform development and regulatory evaluation of new technologies and procedures. Study results may be useful in efforts to develop a set of outcomes to include in future fibroids clinical studies.",1
Preoperative Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging: An Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario) Clinical Practice Guideline.,"BACKGROUND: The use of preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after the diagnosis of breast cancer by mammography and/or ultrasound is inconsistent. METHODS: After conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing preoperative breast MRI versus no MRI, we reconvened to prepare a clinical practice guideline on this topic. RESULTS: Based on the evidence that MRI improved recurrence, decreased the rates of reoperations (re-excisions or conversion mastectomy), and increased detection of synchronous contralateral breast cancer, we recommend that preoperative breast MRI should be considered on a case-by-case basis in patients diagnosed with breast cancer for whom additional information about disease extent could influence treatment. Based on stronger evidence, preoperative breast MRI is recommended in patients diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma for whom additional information about disease extent could influence treatment. For both recommendations, the decision to proceed with MRI would be conditional on shared decision-making between care providers and the patient, taking into account the benefits and risks of MRI as well as patient preferences. Based on the opinion of the Working Group, preoperative breast MRI is also recommended in the following more specific situations: (a) to aid in surgical planning of breast conserving surgery in patients with suspected or known multicentric or multifocal disease; (b) to identify additional lesions in patients with dense breasts; (c) to determine the presence of pectoralis major muscle/chest wall invasion in patients with posteriorly located tumours or when invasion of the pectoralis major muscle or chest wall is suspected; (d) to aid in surgical planning for skin/nipple-sparing mastectomies, autologous reconstruction, oncoplastic surgery, and breast conserving surgery with suspected nipple/areolar involvement; and (e) in patients with familial/hereditary breast cancer but who have not had recent breast MRI as part of screening or diagnosis.",0
Determining patient preferences in the treatment of medication-refractory overactive bladder.,"INTRODUCTION: Overactive bladder (OAB) is often suboptimally addressed by behavioral or pharmacological treatments. Less than 15% of patients choose to pursue advanced OAB therapy (sacral nerve stimulation [SNS], percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation [PTNS], and bladder onabotulinum toxin type-A [BTX-A]). We seek to better understand which factors are most important to patients when choosing a third-line therapy. METHODS/MATERIALS: We developed a conjoint analysis survey that included five attributes of the third-line options for OAB (SNS, PTNS, and BTX-A). We administered the survey to new patients with urinary incontinence at two institutions. A hierarchical Bayes random effects regression analysis was used to determine the relative importance of the attributes. A choice simulator was used to model which third-line treatment options patients preferred. We followed patients to see if they pursued their predicted treatment. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients completed the study of whom 89% were women. There was representation from all age groups. The most important attributes of decision-making were the frequency of future procedures, the risk of catheterization, and the need for a device. On market simulation, SNS was the preferred treatment option (47%), followed by PTNS (29%) and BTX-A (14%). Only 10% of patients did not find any treatment option acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent follow-up, risk of catheterization, and the need for a device were the most important attributes when making a decision on third-line OAB therapy. On market simulation, SNS is the preferred treatment for all age groups though the ultimate choice in third-line therapy may be affected by external factors.",1
