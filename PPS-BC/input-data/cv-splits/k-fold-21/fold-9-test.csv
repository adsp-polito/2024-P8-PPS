Clinical Investigation of Large Volume Subcutaneous Delivery up to 25 mL for Lean and Non-Lean Subjects.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical feasibility and tolerability of large volume subcutaneous delivery at different injection depths for lean and non-lean subjects. METHODS: A single-center, randomized, subject-blinded, crossover study in 62 healthy subjects was conducted to evaluate delivery of a 10-cP solution containing hyaluronic acid. Subjects were separated into lean and non-lean cohort by SC thickness. A syringe pump was used to study the effect of different volumes (5, 12, 25 mL) of a viscous placebo solution and needle lengths (6, 9 and 12 mm) delivered at 0.5 mL/min. RESULTS: Across all treatments, injection sites were observed to have negligible leakage, ~34 kPa of back pressure, and VAS of mild pain with higher pain from needle insertion than during injection. While mild to moderate erythema was the most frequently reported ISR and edema was most prominent for 25 mL injections, all ISRs were resolved within 4 hours post injection. Subjects were unbothered by ISRs across all treatments and rated them as low distress scores (average 1.0-1.5 out of 6). CONCLUSION: SC injection of 25 mL is feasible and tolerable using a low-pain formulation for abdomen injection irrespective of subcutaneous thickness and injection depths at a delivery rate of 0.5 mL/min.",0
Similar Midterm Outcomes of Total Knee Arthroplasties with Anterior and Posterior Tibial Slopes Performed on Paired Knees at a Minimum Follow-up of 5 Years.,"A small posterior tibial slope (PTS) is generally recommended in posterior stabilized (PS) total knee arthroplasty (TKA). An unwanted anterior tibial slope (ATS), which can affect postoperative results, may be created in PS TKA because of the inaccuracy of surgical instruments and techniques, as well as high interpatient variability. We compared midterm clinical and radiographic results of PS TKAs with ATS and PTS performed on paired knees using the same prosthesis. One-hundred-twenty-four patients who underwent TKAs with ATS and PTS on paired knees using ATTUNE posterior-stabilized prostheses were retrospectively reviewed after a minimum follow-up period of 5 years. The mean follow-up period was 5.4 years. The Knee Society Knee and Function scores, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Feller and Kujalar scores, and range of motion (ROM) were evaluated. The preferred TKA out of ATS and PTS was also investigated. The hip-knee-ankle angle, component positions, tibial slope, posterior femoral offset, Insall-Salvati ratio, and knee sagittal angle were measured by radiography. There were no significant differences in the clinical results, including ROM, between TKAs with ATS and PTS preoperatively and at the last follow-up. Regarding patient preference, 58 patients (46.8%) were satisfied with bilateral knees, 30 (24.2%) preferred knees with ATS, and 36 (29%) preferred knees with PTS. There was no significant difference in the rate of preference between TKAs with ATS and PTS (p = 0.539). Except for the postoperative tibial slope (-1.8 vs. 2.5 degrees, p < 0.001), there were also no significant differences in the radiographic results, including the knee sagittal angle, preoperatively and at the last follow-up. The midterm outcomes were similar between PS TKAs with ATS and PTS performed on paired knees at a minimum of 5 years of follow-up. Nonsevere ATS did not affect midterm outcomes in PS TKA with proper soft tissue balancing and the current prosthesis of improved design. However, a long-term follow-up study is required to confirm the safety of nonsevere ATS in PS TKA. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE::  III.",0
Preferences and Adherence of People with Prediabetes for Disease Management and Treatment: A Systematic Review.,"OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively summarize the evaluation, preference, and expectations of people with prediabetes regarding the management and treatment of pre-diabetes. METHODS: Search PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and CNKI for articles about prediabetes, preferences, and expectations from inception of the database to June 2023. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies involving 17,240 participants with prediabetes were included. Although the preferences and views of people with prediabetes vary widely, there are certain trends: 1) Compared with drug therapy, people with prediabetes prefer exercise and nutrition therapies. 2) People with prediabetes expect intensive lifestyle interventions guided by professionals. 3) Effective communication between doctors and people with prediabetes is crucial for promoting the development and implementation of treatment plans. CONCLUSION: The results of this systematic review showed that people with prediabetes prefer intensive lifestyle interventions due to concerns about drug side effects, dependency, and other factors. In addition, drug acceptance and lifestyle interventions options differed among different populations, which emphasized the significance of individualized therapy.",1
Patient preferences of patient selection criteria for upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation: A qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation is a life-enhancing reconstructive treatment option that aims to improve recipients' quality of life and maximize function. This study assessed upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation patient selection criteria perceptions among individuals with upper extremity limb loss. The perceptions of individuals with upper extremity limb loss on patient selection criteria may enable vascularized composite allotransplantation centers to improve criteria to avoid mismatched expectations about the posttransplant vascularized composite allotransplantation experience and outcomes. Realistic patient expectations may increase patient adherence, improve outcomes, and reduce vascularized composite allotransplantation graft loss. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with civilian and military service members with upper extremity limb loss and upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation candidates, participants, and recipients from three US institutions. Interviews assessed perceptions of patient selection criteria for suitability as a candidate for upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation. Thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. RESULTS: A total of 50 individuals participated (66% participation rate). Most participants were male (78%), White (72%), with a unilateral limb loss (84%), and a mean age of 45 years. Six themes emerged regarding upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation patient selection criteria, including support for candidates who: (1) are of younger age, (2) are in good physical health, (3) have mental stability, (4) are willing to ""put in the work,"" (5) have specific amputation characteristics, and (6) have sufficient social support. Patients had preferences about selecting candidates with unilateral versus bilateral limb loss. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that numerous factors, including medical, social, and psychological characteristics, inform patients' perceptions of patient selection criteria for upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation. Patient perceptions of patient selection criteria should inform the development of validated screening measures that optimize patient outcomes.",0
Comparing Outcomes of a Discrete Choice Experiment and Case 2 Best-Worst Scaling: An Application to Neuromuscular Disease Treatment.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Case 2 best-worst scaling (BWS-2) is an increasingly popular method to elicit patient preferences. Because BWS-2 potentially has a lower cognitive burden compared with discrete choice experiments, the aim of this study was to compare treatment preference weights and relative importance scores. METHODS: Patients with neuromuscular diseases completed an online survey at two different moments in time, completing one method per occasion. Patients were randomly assigned to either first a discrete choice experiment or BWS-2. Attributes included: muscle strength, energy endurance, balance, cognition, chance of blurry vision, and chance of liver damage. Multinomial logit was used to calculate overall relative importance scores and latent class logit was used to estimate heterogeneous preference weights and to calculate the relative importance scores of the attributes for each latent class. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients were included for analyses. Overall relative importance scores showed differences in attribute importance rankings between a discrete choice experiment and BWS-2. Latent class analyses indicated three latent classes for both methods, with a specific class in both the discrete choice experiment and BWS-2 in which (avoiding) liver damage was the most important attribute. Ex-post analyses showed that classes differed in sex, age, level of education, and disease status. The discrete choice experiment was easier to understand compared with BWS-2. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that using a discrete choice experiment and BWS-2 leads to different outcomes, both in preference weights as well as in relative importance scores, which might have been caused by the different framing of risks in BWS-2. However, a latent class analysis revealed similar latent classes between methods. Careful consideration about method selection is required, while keeping the specific decision context in mind and pilot testing the methods.",1
Evidence-based treatment of Achilles tendon rupture.,"The treatment of Achilles tendon rupture has recently seen a shift toward non-operative management, as supported by the literature, yet many surgeons continue to treat these injuries operatively. The evidence clearly supports non-operative management of these injuries except for Achilles insertional tears and for certain patient groups, such as athletic patients, for whom further research is warranted. This nonadherence to evidence-based treatment may be explained by patient preference, surgeon subspecialty, surgeon era of practice or other variables. Further research to understand the reasons behind this nonadherence would help to promote conformity in the surgical community across all specialties and adherence to evidence-based approaches.",0
Preferred Conversation Topics with Respect to Treatment Decisions Among Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.,"PURPOSE: Greater knowledge of individuals' needs and preferences can enhance shared decision-making, which is associated with improved quality of decisions and increased satisfaction. This study aimed to identify and prioritize the attributes (ie conversation topics) that individuals with type 2 diabetes find it most important to discuss with their healthcare provider regarding treatment decisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: First, small group interviews were organized with adults with type 2 diabetes (N=8) treated in primary care to identify the attributes that they find important to discuss regarding treatment decisions. A five-step nominal group technique was applied during the interviews. An object best-worst scaling (BWS) survey was subsequently distributed to individuals with self-reported diabetes participating in the Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel of the Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (N=600) to determine the relative importance score (RIS) of the identified attributes. A higher RIS indicates a higher level of perceived importance. Subgroup and latent class analyses were performed to explore whether individuals' demographic and disease characteristics influenced their attribute preferences. RESULTS: A total of 21 attributes were identified during three small group interviews with individuals with type 2 diabetes. Respondents in the BWS survey (N=285) viewed ""quality of life"" (RIS=11.97), ""clinical outcomes"" (RIS=10.40), ""long-term diabetes complications"" (RIS=9.83) and ""short-term adverse medication"" (RIS=7.72) as the most important in the decision-making process for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Some differences in attribute preferences were identified according to demographic and disease characteristics. CONCLUSION: In general, individuals with type 2 diabetes not only want to discuss the biological effects of treatments, but also the impact of treatment on their quality of life. Healthcare providers should be aware that attributes are viewed differently by different individuals. This emphasizes the need for tailor-made healthcare decisions, which means eliciting and responding to individual preferences in the decision-making process.",1
Out-of-Pocket Cost Modeling of Adjuvant Radiation Therapy Duration in Standard-of-Care Early Stage Breast Cancer Treatment Across Medicaid and Medicare Plans.,"PURPOSE: For early stage breast cancer (BC), the choice of radiation therapy duration (1 vs 3 weeks) is highly debated. Cost and financial toxicity are major concerns that patients with BC face. Nonetheless, there remain limited discussions providing granular details of the role of insurance in the aggregate cost of 1 week versus 3 weeks of radiation therapy for patients. This project aims to disaggregate costs by plan to increase transparency of out-of-pocket (OOP) cost estimates in radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Treatment procedures were determined through the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. OOP treatment costs, deductibles, and copays/coinsurance were calculated by using Medicaid, Original Medicare, Medigap Plan G, and Medicare Part D prescription plans. The medicare.gov, medicaid.oh.gov, aarpmedicareplans.com, and the physician fee schedule from cms.gov were used to determine costs by treatment. Price estimates reflect actual costs per insurance plan rather than costs estimated from claims data. All procedures were considered to be performed in an Ohio hospital setting. One-week radiation therapy was defined as 5 fractions without boost, and 3-week radiation therapy was defined as 15 fractions without boost. RESULTS: Medicare beneficiaries with Original Medicare coverage face an OOP treatment charge of $649.24 for 1 week of radiation therapy and $1006.20 for 3 weeks of radiation therapy. Assuming the deductible is met postlumpectomy, Medigap Plan G beneficiaries are faced with no additional charges for both lengths of radiation therapy. Similarly for Medicaid beneficiaries (assuming treatment is approved by Medicaid), all expenses are covered without limit, resulting in no OOP expense. CONCLUSIONS: Considerations of 1 and 3 weeks of radiation therapy for postlumpectomy early-stage BC are often dependent on cancer characteristics and patient preferences. This model (based on actual cost estimates per insurance plan rather than claims data) compares OOP costs across Medicaid and Medicare plans, which more holistically informs providers and patients in radiation therapy duration decision making.",0
Telemedicine in a spine clinic setting: a large survey of patient preferences and experiences.,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has greatly disturbed healthcare and the practice of neurosurgery. As healthcare systems evolve in the face of COVID-19, the use of telehealth platforms has expanded. We presented the results of a large survey of patient perspectives on the role of telehealth in the care of spine clinic patients. METHODS: All patients at the spine clinic of a large, tertiary, academic medical center were surveyed at their clinic visit from May 30, 2020-June 30, 2020. All responses were anonymous, and results were analyzed with standard statistical techniques. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-six surveys were returned and 164 were entirely completed. 56.8% of patients were new while 24.4% were postoperative follow-up visits: 54.9% had lumbar symptoms. 85% had pain while more than half also reported weakness; 58% traveled greater than twenty-five miles for their appointment; 96% had transportation readily available. Of all respondents, only 15.3% preferred the appointment via video telehealth while 4% had no preference between in-person appointment or virtual visit. Preference for telehealth appointment was not associated with factors such as new or established in the practice, spinal region of symptoms, pain, weakness, comfort with technology, age, or duration of symptoms. There was a significant difference between how far the patient traveled for the clinic appointment and their preference for a telehealth appointment, with patients traveling further distances favoring telehealth (P=0.04). This effect remained significant when stratifying based on 25 miles (P=0.03) or 50 miles (P=0.03) but not when stratifying based on 100 miles (P=0.32). However, the sample size of patients traveling >100 miles was small, limiting any inference regarding that subgroup. Access to transportation was associated with preference for telehealth (88.89% vs. 97.18%, P=0.08) but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Most spine patients prefer in-person clinic appointments to virtual appointments. These preferences should be considered when arranging patient encounters.",0
American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Practice Guideline: Pharmacological Management of Chronic Idiopathic Constipation.,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is a common disorder associated with significant impairment in quality of life. This clinical practice guideline, jointly developed by the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology, aims to inform clinicians and patients by providing evidence-based practice recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of CIC in adults. METHODS: The American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that conducted systematic reviews of the following agents: fiber, osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol, magnesium oxide, lactulose), stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, senna), secretagogues (lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide), and serotonin type 4 agonist (prucalopride). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to assess the certainty of evidence for each intervention. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop clinical recommendations based on the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 10 recommendations for the pharmacological management of CIC in adults. Based on available evidence, the panel made strong recommendations for the use of polyethylene glycol, sodium picosulfate, linaclotide, plecanatide, and prucalopride for CIC in adults. Conditional recommendations were made for the use of fiber, lactulose, senna, magnesium oxide, and lubiprostone. DISCUSSION: This document provides a comprehensive outline of the various over-the-counter and prescription pharmacological agents available for the treatment of CIC. The guidelines are meant to provide a framework for approaching the management of CIC; clinical providers should engage in shared decision making based on patient preferences as well as medication cost and availability. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted to help guide future research opportunities and enhance the care of patients with chronic constipation.",0
"Contracting retail pharmacies as a source of essential medicines for public sector clients in low- and middle-income countries: a scoping review of key considerations, challenges, and opportunities.","BACKGROUND: Insurances in high-income countries (HIC) often contract with private community pharmacies to dispense medicines to outpatients. In contrast, dispensing of medicines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) often lacks such contractual arrangements. Furthermore, many LMICs lack sufficient investment in supply chains and financial and human resources to guarantee stock levels and services at public medicine-dispensing institutions. Countries striving to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) can, in principle, incorporate retail pharmacies into their supply chains to expand access to essential medicines (EMs). The objectives of this paper are (a) to identify and analyze key considerations, opportunities and challenges for public payers when contracting out the supply and dispensing of medicines to retail pharmacies and (b) to provide examples of strategies and policies to address these challenges. METHODS: A targeted literature strategy was used to conduct this scoping review. We created an analytical framework of key dimensions: (1) governance (including medicine and pharmacy regulation); (2) contracting (3) reimbursement; (4) medicine affordability (5) equitable access; and (6) quality of care (including 'patient-centered' pharmaceutical care). Using this framework, we selected a mix of three HIC and four LMIC case studies and analyzed the opportunities and challenges encountered when contracting retail pharmacies. RESULTS: From this analysis, we identified a set of opportunities and challenges that should be considered by public payers considering public-private contracting: (1) balancing business viability with medicine affordability; (2) incentivizing equitable access to medicines; (3) ensuring quality of care and delivery of services; (4) ensuring product quality; (5) task-sharing from primary care providers to pharmacies and (6) securing human resources and related capacity constraints to ensure sustainability of the contract. CONCLUSION: Public-private partnerships offer opportunities to improve access to EMs. Nonetheless, managing these agreements is complex and is influenced by a variety of factors. For effective contractual partnerships, a systems approach is needed in which business, industry and regulatory contexts are considered in tandem with the health system. Special attention should be devoted to rapidly changing health contexts and systems, such as changes in patient preferences and market developments brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
Patient preferences for atopic dermatitis treatments: a discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) experience skin lesions and intense itch that substantially affect quality of life. Patients have choices among systemic AD treatments that offer varied benefit-risk profiles. OBJECTIVE: Measure patients' willingness to trade off the risks and benefits of systemic treatments among individuals with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of moderate-to-severe AD. METHODS: Patients participated in a discrete choice experiment online survey with a series of choices between hypothetical AD treatments defined by six attributes reflecting benefits and risks of treatments (itch reduction, time until noticeable itch reduction, chance of clear or almost clear skin, risk of serious infection, risk of developing acne, and need for prescription topical steroids). Data were analyzed with a random parameters logit model to quantify preferences and the relative importance of attributes for treatment alternatives. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 200) placed the highest relative importance on itch reduction, speed of itch reduction, and skin clearance, and were generally willing to accept clinically relevant levels of risk of serious infection and acne in exchange for treatment benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with moderate-to-severe AD were willing to trade clinically relevant treatment risks for greater or more rapid itch reduction and skin clearance offered by systemic therapies.",1
Risk thresholds for patients to switch between daily tablets and biweekly infusions in second-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a patient preference study.,"BACKGROUND: Historically, high hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-related mortality has been, in part, due to lack of effective therapies; however, several systemic therapies have been recently approved for HCC treatment, including regorafenib and ramucirumab. These two treatments utilize different routes of administration (four daily tablets and biweekly intravenous infusions, respectively) and have different risks of adverse events (AEs). However, we lack data on patient preferences in balancing the route of administration and risk of AEs in patients with HCC. We aimed to determine patient preferences and trade-offs for second-line treatment in patients with HCC.  METHODS: Patients with advanced or metastatic HCC were recruited through their physicians for this study. Patient preferences were assessed by using a modified threshold technique (TT) design in which respondents were asked two direct-elicitation questions before (assuming same safety and efficacy and only varying mode of administration) and after (incorporating the safety profiles of ramucirumab and regorafenib) the TT series on seven risks of clinically relevant AEs. RESULTS: In total, of the 157 patients recruited by their physicians, 150 were eligible and consented to participate. In the first elicitation question (assuming risk and efficacy were equivalent), 61.3% of patients preferred daily tablets. However, 76.7% of patients preferred the biweekly infusion when the safety profiles of the two available second-line therapies were included. The TT analysis confirmed that preferences for oral administration were not strong enough to balance out the risk of AEs that differentiate the two therapies. DISCUSSION: We found that when patients were asked to choose between a daily, oral medication and a biweekly IV medication for HCC, they were more likely to choose a daily, oral medication if efficacy and safety profiles were the same. However, when risks of AEs representing the safety profiles of two currently available second-line treatments were introduced in a second direct-elicitation question, respondents often selected an IV administration with a safety profile similar to ramucirumab, rather than oral tablets with a safety profile similar to regorafenib. Our findings indicate that the risk profile of a second-line treatment for HCC may be more important than the mode of administration to patients.",1
Quality of prenatal and postpartum telehealth visits during COVID-19 and preferences for future care.,"BACKGROUND: At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth practices for pregnancy-related care were rapidly implemented. Telehealth for pregnancy-related care is likely to continue after the pandemic. In order for health systems and clinicians to provide person-centered pregnancy-related care via telehealth, it is critical to understand patients' telehealth experiences and their preferences regarding the use of telehealth moving forward. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe perceived quality of prenatal and postpartum telehealth visits during COVID-19 and to examine the association between telehealth quality during the pandemic and future telehealth preferences. STUDY DESIGN: We used data from of an online sample of US women aged 18 to 45 years seeking reproductive health care during COVID-19. Two cross-sections of survey data were collected in July 2020 and January 2021. This analysis included those who sought prenatal (n=1496) or postpartum (n=482) care during the pandemic. Among those who had a prenatal or postpartum telehealth visit, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between a measure of perceived telehealth quality and openness to future telehealth visits, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 57.5% of prenatal and 52.9% of postpartum respondents had a telehealth appointment. Respondents agreed with most statements about the quality of their telehealth appointments, with ≥80% reporting that they were convenient, easy, safe, and provided good information. Lower-ranked quality items were related to visits feeling personal and the patient feeling cared for. A total of 35.2% of prenatal (n=816) and 43.3% of postpartum (n=231) respondents expressed openness to telehealth visits in the future. Prenatal and postpartum respondents reporting higher telehealth quality had increased odds of being open to telehealth in the future (prenatal: adjusted odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-1.3; postpartum: adjusted odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.3). CONCLUSION: Prenatal and postpartum respondents with better telehealth experiences were more likely to express openness to telehealth in the future, although most preferred future in-person visits. As pregnancy-related telehealth continues, it is important to offer appointment options that match patient preferences, especially populations that face barriers in access to care, and to explore ways to personalize care and support positive patient-provider relationships.",0
Patients who have undergone total shoulder arthroplasty prefer greater surgeon involvement in shared decision making.,"BACKGROUND: There has been a shift in medical decision making from a paternalist model to a shared decision-making (SDM) approach, described as a patient-physician relationship where both parties collaborate to arrive on an evidence-based treatment regimen that best suits the patient's needs and values. However, there is a scarcity in evidence regarding SDM in shoulder arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to evaluate overall patient preference for SDM and determine demographic and socioeconomic factors related to SDM preference in those undergoing shoulder arthroplasty. METHODS: Patients aged 40-89 years who had undergone a total shoulder arthroplasty were enrolled. Two-part questionnaires were administered collecting patient demographic information and SDM subscale scores postoperatively. Bivariate and multivariate regression models were used to determine factors associated with SDM Total and subscale scores. RESULTS: A total of 125 patients (53 male; mean age, 69.5 ± 10.4 years) who had undergone primary total shoulder arthroplasty were included. The mean Total SDM score was -2.24 ± 1.9 and the Preoperative, Operative, and Postoperative SDM subscale scores were -1.54 ± 2.0, -2.59 ± 2.2, and -2.48 ± 2.1, respectively, indicating a preference for SDM in the Preoperative subscale and surgeon-driven decision making in the total score and other 2 subscales. Multivariate regression models demonstrated a preference for surgeon decision making at both the 4-12-week postoperative period for the Preoperative subscale (odds ratio [OR] -1.03, 95% CI -2.0, -0.1, P = .039) and the 2-4-week postoperative period for the Operative subscale (OR -1.74, 95% CI -3.4, -0.1, P = .038) when compared to patients at the 2-week postoperative period. No other variables were significantly associated with any of the SDM subscale scores or Total SDM score. CONCLUSION: Patients reported a more passive role in the decision-making process with an overall preference for a surgeon-led approach in primary total shoulder arthroplasty. Patients preferred a shared decision-making approach in regard to preoperative considerations but indicated a significant preference for surgeon-led decision making regarding day of surgery decisions. There were no correlations between SDM scores and age, sex, race, income, education level, insurance type, or treating surgeon. Overall, patients demonstrated a predilection for an SDM approach for preoperative considerations, contrary to those decisions associated with the day of surgery and postoperative care.",0
A scoping review on two-stage randomized preference trial in the field of mental health and addiction.,"BACKGROUND: Randomized Controlled Trial is the most rigorous study design to test the efficacy and effectiveness of an intervention. Patient preference may negatively affect patient performance and decrease the generalizability of a trial to clinical population. Patient preference trial have particular implications in the field of mental health and addiction since mental health interventions are generally complex, blinding of intervention is often difficult or impossible, patients may have strong preference, and outcome measures are often subjective patient self-report which may be greatly influenced if patient's preference did not match with the intervention received. METHODS: In this review, we have surveyed the application of two-stage randomized preference trial with focus on studies in the field of mental health and addiction. The study selection followed the guideline provided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. RESULTS: Six two-stage randomized preference trials (ten publications) have been identified in the field of mental health field and addiction. In these trials, the pooled dropout rates were 18.3% for the preference arm, and 28.7% for the random arm, with a pooled RR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56-0.88; P = 0.010) indicating lower risk of dropout in the preference arm. The standardized preference effects varied widely from 0.07 to 0.57, and could be as large as the treatment effect in some of the trials. CONCLUSION: This scoping review has shown that two-stage randomized preference trials are not as popular as expected in mental health research. The results indicated that two-stage randomized preference trials in mental health would be beneficial in retaining patients to expand the generalizability of the trial.",0
Phases and Transitions of Serious Illness: A Structure for Teaching Palliative Care.,"BACKGROUND: Palliative care (PC) focuses on listening to patient preferences, goals, and values to help health care providers educate, support, and collaborate during challenging disease processes, demanding treatments, and difficult decision-making. METHOD: A recently developed Phases and Transitions Model for Serious Illness helps guide nursing students in initiating therapeutic conversations about PC. Each phase and transition shows unique characteristics of illness and treatment to clarify the importance of introducing PC for that phase. Interventions in education, support, and treatment help students guide patients and families through the trajectory of serious illness. RESULTS: The Phases and Transitions Model for Serious Illness and PC interventions provide a clear and practical structure to educate and empower nursing students to engage in PC conversations. CONCLUSION: Nursing educators can integrate this new model to broaden the perspective of PC as an everyday nursing practice for patients who have a serious illness.

"Society of Surgical Oncology Breast Disease Site Working Group Statement on Contralateral Mastectomy: Indications, Outcomes, and Risks.","Rates of contralateral mastectomy (CM) among patients with unilateral breast cancer have been increasing in the United States. In this Society of Surgical Oncology position statement, we review the literature addressing the indications, risks, and benefits of CM since the society's 2017 statement. We held a virtual meeting to outline key topics and then conducted a literature search using PubMed to identify relevant articles. We reviewed the articles and made recommendations based on group consensus. Patients consider CM for many reasons, including concerns regarding the risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC), desire for improved cosmesis and symmetry, and preferences to avoid ongoing screening, whereas surgeons primarily consider CBC risk when making a recommendation for CM. For patients with a high risk of CBC, CM reduces the risk of new breast cancer, however it is not known to convey an overall survival benefit. Studies evaluating patient satisfaction with CM and reconstruction have yielded mixed results. Imaging with mammography within 12 months before CM is recommended, but routine preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging is not; there is also no evidence to support routine postmastectomy imaging surveillance. Because the likelihood of identifying an occult malignancy during CM is low, routine sentinel lymph node surgery is not recommended. Data on the rates of postoperative complications are conflicting, and such complications may not be directly related to CM. Adjuvant therapy delays due to complications have not been reported. Surgeons can reduce CM rates by encouraging shared decision making and informed discussions incorporating patient preferences.",0
The ampulla of Vater: A potential target for metastatic melanoma?,"Malignant melanomas are aggressive cancers that can prove to be fatal, with Australia harbouring the highest incidence of skin cancers worldwide. Surprisingly, as little as 13.4% of patients undergoing surgical resection of high-risk melanomas remain disease-free after 2 years, with 31.6% showing evidence of distant spread. Although rare, secondary tumours of the ampulla of Vater have been documented, with the most common primaries involving breast, renal and melanoma cancers. We report the case of a malignant melanoma of the ampulla of Vater occurring in a patient 4-year post-surgical resection of a Stage II melanoma manifesting as acute pancreatitis with obstructive jaundice. Given the rarity of secondary ampullary tumours, metastatic melanoma should always be considered in patients with obstructive jaundice and a history of melanoma resection. In the absence of distant disease, surgery may be considered after consensus at multidisciplinary team meetings and after consideration of the patient preference.",0
Hartmann's procedure in rectal cancer surgery is often an intraoperative decision: a retrospective multicenter study.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate patient-related factors predicting the selection of rectal cancer patients to Hartmann's procedure as well as to investigate how often, and on what grounds, anterior resection is intraoperatively changed to Hartmann's procedure. METHODS: Prospectively collected data from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry regarding patients with rectal cancer operated upon from January 1 2007 to June 30 2017 in the county of Skåne were retrospectively reviewed. Data were expanded with further details from medical charts. A univariable analysis was performed to investigate variables associated with unplanned HP and significant variables included in a multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Altogether, 1141 patients who underwent Hartmann's procedure (275 patients, 24%), anterior resection (491 patients, 43%), or abdominoperineal resection (375 patients, 33%) were included. Patients undergoing Hartmann's procedure were significantly older and had more frequently comorbidity. The decision to perform Hartmann's procedure was made preoperatively in 209 (76%) patients, most commonly because of a comorbidity (27%) or oncological reasons (25%). Patient preference was noted in 8% of cases. In 64 cases (23%), the decision was made intraoperatively, most often due to anastomotic difficulties (60%) and oncological reasons (22%). Anastomotic difficulties were most often reported due to technical difficulties, a low tumor or neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Male gender was a significant risk factor for undergoing unplanned Hartmann's procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The decision to perform Hartmann's procedure was frequently made intraoperatively. Hartmann's procedure should be considered and discussed preoperatively in old and frail patients, especially in the presence of mid-rectal cancer and/or male gender, since these factors increase the risk of intraoperative anastomotic difficulties.",0
Comparative study of different combinations of mirabegron and antimuscarinics in treatment for overactive bladder syndrome in elderly patients.,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the therapeutic efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and patient preference in elderly patients with overactive bladder (OAB) receiving different combinations of mirabegron and solifenacin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Elderly OAB patients received mirabegron 25 mg (M25) daily for 1 month (1M) followed by randomization to receive M25 (Group 1), mirabegron 50 mg (M50, Group 2), solifenacin 5 mg (S5, group 3); or M25 plus S5 (Group 4) for further 2 months. Efficacy and AEs were evaluated. At the end of 3M, patients' preferred option for future treatment was investigated. RESULTS: A total of 168 patients were enrolled, and 100 completed 3-month treatment. At 1M, all parameters improved significantly except postvoid residual (PVR), 23 (13.7%) patients had no symptom, 16 (9.5%) had no improvement, and 10 (6.0%) withdrew from the trial. Compared parameters at 3M with 1M revealed that quality of life, Patient's Perception of Bladder Condition scores, and voided volume improved significantly in group 1; the OAB Symptom Score (OABSS) increased in group 2; mean PVR and Global Response Assessment (GRA) deteriorated in group 3; and the OABSS and GRA improved in group 4. At 3M, the AEs prevalence increased significantly in group 3. Only 38.1% in group 4 preferred long-term usage of combination therapy. CONCLUSION: M25 daily is effective and safe in treating elderly OAB patients. Dose escalation to 50 mg or shifting to S5 does not increase the therapeutic efficacy. Combining M25 with S5 provides better treatment efficacy but is associated with lower patient compliance than M25 alone.",0
Suboptimal Clinical and Quality of Life Outcomes in Patients with Psoriasis Undertreated with Oral Therapies: International Physician and Patient Survey.,"INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, immune-mediated disease. This study assessed the time at which patients switched from a conventional oral systemic treatment to a biologic therapy; patient clinical and quality of life (QoL) outcomes associated with oral systemic treatments; and the proportion of patients who persisted on oral therapy (nonswitchers), despite reported suboptimal clinical and QoL outcomes. METHODS: This data analysis used the Adelphi Real World Psoriasis Disease Specific Programme, a non-interventional, retrospective, cross-sectional survey conducted in the USA, France, Germany, and United Kingdom (August 2018-April 2019). Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis assessed switching from oral to biologic therapy in patients treated ≥ 3 years at survey completion (n = 597). The severity of psoriasis was reported by physicians as the percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected by psoriasis. Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores were calculated for three groups: nonswitchers who met treatment failure criteria, nonswitchers who did not meet failure criteria, and switchers to a biologic therapy. RESULTS: In KM analysis, approximately 50% of the patient population switched by 24 months. A substantial portion of nonswitchers continued to have moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Among nonswitchers, 57-77% had BSA ≥ 3% and 16-24% had BSA ≥ 10% at the time of the survey compared with 37% of switchers who had BSA of ≥ 3% and 9% who had BSA of ≥ 10%. QoL was poor among nonswitchers. The mean [standard deviation (SD)] DLQI scores for nonswitchers meeting treatment failure criteria, nonswitchers not meeting failure criteria, and switchers were 6.11 (4.55), 2.62 (3.29), and 2.25 (4.23), respectively. CONCLUSION: There is a clear unmet need for more effective oral therapies, and further research into the reasons for patients remaining undertreated, which may include patient preference for oral treatments (despite lack of response), contraindications, or insurance/formulary-related barriers to access, are needed.",0
Factors Associated With Comfort Using Telemedicine for Upper Limb Specialty Care.,"PURPOSE: There is a growing interest in diagnosis and treatment through telemedicine because of its convenience, accessibility, and lower costs. There are clinician and patient barriers to wider adoption of telemedicine. To support the effective and equitable use of telemedicine, we investigated the patient, illness, and surgeon factors associated with the specialist level of comfort in providing upper limb care via telemedicine. METHODS: Seventy-five upper-extremity musculoskeletal specialists completed an online survey-based experiment in which they viewed 12 patient scenarios with randomized patient age, gender, diagnosis, pain intensity, and patient preference for surgical treatment (yes or no) and rated their comfort with telemedicine from 0, no comfort, to 10, complete comfort. The participants were able to provide a rationale for their stance in open text boxes. We recorded the following specialist factors: gender, location of practice, years in practice, subspecialty, the supervision of trainees, and surgeon-rated importance of a physical examination. RESULTS: In a multivariable analysis, greater surgeon comfort using telemedicine was associated with nontrauma conditions, four specific diagnoses, and patients who did not have severe pain. Lower surgeon comfort with telemedicine was associated with the higher clinician-rated importance of a hands-on physical examination and supervising trainees. Text-based reasons provided for relative comfort with telemedicine included nonsurgical treatment and facility of diagnosis based on interviews alone. Text-based reasons for relative discomfort with telemedicine included a perceived need for a hands-on physical examination and a preference for an in-person conversation for specific discussions, including scheduling surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Greater specialist enthusiasm for telemedicine is associated with personal preferences regarding the upper-extremity condition, patients with less severe pain, and a willingness to forego a hands-on examination. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Utilization of telemedicine for upper-extremity specialty care may be facilitated by diagnosis-specific care strategies and strategies for video examination, with a focus on tactics that are effective for people with more intense symptoms.",0
Time to embed physical activity within usual care in cancer services: A qualitative study of cancer healthcare professionals' views at a single centre in England.,"PURPOSE: An increasing number of people affected by cancer (PABC) are living longer lives as treatment continues to advance. There is growing evidence for physical activity (PA) supporting health in this population before, during and after cancer treatment, but PA advice is not part of usual care. This study investigates views of frontline oncology healthcare professionals (HCPs) in one NHS teaching hospital in England to understand the role of PA advice across cancer services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a qualitative study interviewing HCPs and using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four main themes were identified: 1. Awareness of the roles of PA in cancer; 2. Patient-specific factors in rehabilitation; 3. Cancer-specific factors in rehabilitation; 4. Barriers and opportunities to integrating PA within usual care. HCPs' awareness of the role of PA in cancer rehabilitation was low overall and PA was found not to be embedded within rehabilitation. Contrastingly, there was awareness of PA's potential to impact disease and treatment-related outcomes positively. Ideas for PA integration included training for staff and giving PA advice within consultations. CONCLUSIONS: Low awareness of benefits of PA-based rehabilitation and lack of integration in usual care contrasted with HCPs' interest in this area's potential. Training HCPs to begin the conversation with patients affected by cancer in teachable moments may increase patient access.Implications for rehabilitationIntegrating physical activity education and training for trainees and existing healthcare professionals workforce would help embed physical activity into routine clinical practice.Brief advice intervention training during every consultation, such as providing relevant individualised information and signposting, can be impactful.Physical activity within a broader cancer rehabilitation programme should be integrated as standard for every cancer patient.Individualised plans may include prehabilitation, restorative rehabilitation and palliative rehabilitation.Patient preferences and the patient experience should continue to shape service design.There is a need to ensure physical activity advice is consistent throughout healthcare settings and not fragmented between primary, secondary and tertiary care.",0
Patients values regarding primary health care: a systematic review of qualitative and quantitative evidence.,"BACKGROUND: Accessible and high-quality primary health care (PHC) is fundamental to countries moving towards universal health coverage. In order to improve the quality of patient-centered care provided in PHC, a comprehensive understanding of patients' values is crucial to address any gaps in the health care system. This systematic review aimed to identify patients' values relevant to PHC. METHODS: We searched primary qualitative and quantitative studies about patients' values related to primary care in PubMed and EMBASE (Ovid) from 2009 to 2020. The studies' quality was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for both quantitative and qualitative studies and Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Studies (COREQ) for qualitative studies. A thematic approach was used in the data synthesis. OUTCOME: The database search resulted in 1,817 articles. A total of 68 articles were full-text screened. Data were extracted from nine quantitative and nine qualitative studies that met the inclusion criteria. The participants of the studies were mainly the general population in high-income countries. Four themes emerged from the analysis: patients' values related to privacy and autonomy; values associated with the general practitioners including virtuous characteristics, knowledge and competence; values involving patient-doctor interactions such as shared decision-making and empowerment; and core values related to the primary care system such as continuity, referral, and accessibility. CONCLUSIONS: This review reveals that the doctor's personal characteristics and their interactions with the patients are critical considerations concerning the primary care services from the patients' point of view. The inclusion of these values is essential to improve the quality of primary care.",0
Assessing Stakeholder Engagement for Outcomes-Based Research Among Patients With Chronic Rhinosinusitis and Asthma: A Survey-Based Investigation.,"BACKGROUND: Despite significant morbidity, there remains a critical need for prospective analyses to investigate the impact of comorbid chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with asthma (CRSwA) on patient centered outcomes. The objective of this study was to ascertain critical stakeholder feedback from patients that could inform future study design based on patient preferences, in an effort to optimize patient enrollment. METHODS: A prospective, descriptive study was performed in order to determine the importance of various factors on CRSwA treatment among critical stakeholders. A Likert-scale survey highlighting various aspects of treatment of CRSwA and elucidating patient enthusiasm for clinical enrollment was constructed and prospectively administered to patients with CRSwA. A univariate analysis was instituted to understand the significance of the different trial design preferences. RESULTS: Survey responses were collected from a total of 17 patients with CRSwA. With Likert scores >4/5, responses indicated significant stakeholder interest in research focused on understanding symptom triggers, including the impact of air quality and allergens. Importantly, the highest mean scores noted were for studies focused on improving (1) overall quality of life (4.8/5) and (2) lung function (4.8/5). Patients appeared least interested in participation in a randomized trial, whereas the greatest support was communicated for a purely observational trial (P = .08). CONCLUSION: Patients with CRSwA demonstrate enthusiasm for participation in research that focuses on improving patient centered outcomes-specifically quality of life and lung function. Stakeholder feedback also indicates a preference for observational study design over randomized control trials.",0
Patients' acceptance of a shared cancer follow-up model of care between general practitioners and radiation oncologists: A population-based survey using the theoretical Framework of Acceptability.,"INTRODUCTION: International and national guidelines highlight the need for general practitioner involvement during and after active cancer treatment and throughout long-term follow-up care. This paper aimed to evaluate patients' acceptance of radiation oncology shared follow-up care using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA). METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at two cancer care centres in the Illawarra Shoalhaven region of Australia. A sample of patients scheduled for a radiation oncology follow-up consultation in 2021 were sent a 32-point self-complete paper-based survey. Data were analysed using descriptive, parametric and non-parametric statistical analysis. This paper followed the Checklist for Reporting of Survey Studies (CROSS). RESULTS: Of the 414 surveys returned (45% response rate), the acceptance for radiation oncology shared cancer follow-up care was high (80%). Patients treated with only radiotherapy were 1.7 times more likely to accept shared follow-up care than those treated with multiple modalities. Patients who preferred follow-up care for fewer than three years were 7.5 times more likely to accept shared care than those who preferred follow-up care for five years. Patients who travelled more than 20 minutes to their radiation oncologist or to the rural cancer centre were slightly more likely to accept shared care than those who travelled less than twenty minutes to the regional cancer centre. A high understanding of shared care (Intervention Coherence) and a positive feeling towards shared care (Affective Attitude) were significant predictive factors in accepting shared radiation oncology follow-up care. CONCLUSION: Health services need to ensure patient preferences are considered to provide patient-centred cancer follow-up care. Shared cancer follow-up care implementation should start with patients who prefer a shorter follow-up period and understand the benefits of shared care. However, patients' involvement needs to be considered alongside other clinical risk profiles and organisational factors. Future qualitative research using the TFA constructs is warranted to inform clinical practice change.",0
"Prevalence of Hemorrhoids and Their Risk Factors Among the Adult Population in Jazan, Saudi Arabia.","BACKGROUND: Hemorrhoids are defined as the symptomatic enlargement and distal displacement of the normal anal cushions. They can be either internal, external, or internoexternal, according to their position in relation to the dentate line. They can cause significant financial burdens and personal discomfort. However, the typical symptoms of hemorrhoids include bleeding, pain, skin irritation, fecal leakage, prolapse, mucus secretion, and developing a thrombosed hernia. Nonetheless, research has shown that individuals with and without hemorrhoids equally report these symptoms. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of hemorrhoids and their risk factors among adult subjects in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This investigation was a cross-sectional study targeting adults diagnosed with hemorrhoids in the Jazan region. Data collection was performed via a self-administered questionnaire to measure sociodemographic data of the participants, lifestyle factors associated with hemorrhoids, clinical presentations of the disease, and Rome IV criteria for diagnosis of functional constipation. The chi-squared test was used to assess the frequency of hemorrhoid symptoms according to the participants' sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. RESULTS: In the current study, which recruited 361 participants, 59% (216 individuals) reported experiencing at least one symptom of hemorrhoids. The majority of the sample were females (60%), Saudis (96%), and living in urban areas (59%) and had a university education (77.3%). The most common risk factors identified were lack of regular physical activity (83%), prolonged sitting during office work (51%), and consuming food with saturated fat (50%). A total of 44% (159 participants) had a family history of hemorrhoids, and 40% reported suffering from constipation three times or more per week. Only 34% (123 participants) had been diagnosed with hemorrhoids by a physician. Interestingly, the majority of participants (57%) preferred using home remedies instead of seeking medical care from a healthcare professional. When assessing factors associated with experiencing a minimum of six hemorrhoid symptoms per month, age, lifestyle factors, family history of hemorrhoids, and defecation practices were found to be significantly correlated with a higher occurrence of symptoms (with a p-value of less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: The current study identified a high prevalence of hemorrhoid symptoms and their risk factors among the adult population in the Jazan region of Saudi Arabia. The findings suggest a need to increase the awareness of the public about hemorrhoids risk factors and the importance of seeking healthcare at an early stage of the disease.",0
"Assessing Medical Ethics Knowledge and Practice Among Healthcare Professionals in Al Majma'ah, Saudi Arabia.","Background The healthcare system is increasingly confronted with ethical challenges, necessitating a thorough exploration of healthcare providers' ethical knowledge and attitudes. This study aims to evaluate the ethical awareness and attitudes of healthcare providers in the Al Majma'ah region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Aim This research focuses on assessing the level of knowledge and practice regarding medical ethics among healthcare providers in a community hospital in Majmaah, KSA. Methods A comprehensive cross-sectional study was undertaken in the Majmaah governorate of Saudi Arabia. Data collection involved distributing a meticulously designed questionnaire to healthcare providers and faculty members affiliated with the College of Medicine. Subsequently, the acquired dataset underwent analysis utilizing SPSS software. Results A total of 183 participants were included in the study. The findings revealed that only 77 respondents (42.1%) considered ethical issues in their profession as extremely important. Moreover, 104 participants (56.8%) were aware of the existence of an ethics committee in their institution. A total of 113 respondents (61.7%) disagreed with the notion that ethical conduct is primarily important to avoid legal consequences, and 120 participants (65.6%) believed in the significance of in-service training on medical ethics for doctors. The study also highlighted that 100 participants (54.6%) believed that healthcare providers' opinions supersede patient preferences. However, a majority, 163 participants (89.1%), agreed that patients should be informed of any wrongdoing, contrasting with only 20 (10.9%) who disagreed. When asked about adhering to patients' wishes despite doctors' opinions, 112 (61.2%) responded affirmatively, while 71 (38.3%) disagreed. There was also a disparity in opinions regarding the necessity of obtaining consent, with 81 (44.3%) agreeing that consent is required not only for surgical procedures but also for medications or investigations. Furthermore, 137 participants (74.9%) recognized the importance of discussing ethical, social, and legal issues during clinical rounds alongside clinical aspects of patient care, while 46 (25.1%) disagreed. Conclusion Although medical ethics were introduced into the Saudi healthcare system more than a decade ago, this study underscores the ethical necessity of obtaining comprehensive informed consent prior to invasive and other medical procedures. It also highlights the significance of engaging patients in the decision-making process regarding their treatment. Well-informed patients typically exhibit higher satisfaction levels and are less inclined to pursue legal action.",0
Preference of acromegaly patients for treatment attributes in Spain.,"OBJECTIVE: Acromegaly is a rare disease caused by increased growth hormone secretion and a subsequent increase in insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels. Patients display multiple comorbidities that affect their quality of life (QoL). Treatment aims to maintain good biochemical control, tumour control and reduce the risk of comorbidities; however, their impact on QoL has been overlooked until recently. We interviewed patients to explore their preferences with regard to treatment attributes. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study based on interviews and a discrete choice experiment (DCE) in a Spanish cohort. METHODS: Adult patients diagnosed with acromegaly ≥1 year before the start of the study and under treatment were included. Treatment attributes were collected from patient testimony during face-to-face interviews. Then, a DCE was performed to elicit patient preferences for certain treatment attributes. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients completed the study. QoL improvement was the most important treatment attribute (37%), followed by IGF-I control (20%), blood sugar control (17%) and tumour control (13%). Secondary attributes were pain associated with the route of administration (7%), diarrhoea (2%), administration method (2%) and storage conditions (2%). We then calculated the theoretical share of preference for existing treatments, based on the individual preference utility for each attribute and level. Pegvisomant obtained the highest share of preference overall, and the highest preference as a second-line treatment (53 and 95%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: QoL greatly influences patient treatment preference. Since acromegaly patients are informed and aware of their disease, treatment choices should always be shared with patients.",1
Virtual multidisciplinary pain treatment: Experiences and feedback from children with chronic pain and their caregivers.,"BACKGROUND: The onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) necessitated a rapid transition to virtual care for chronic pain treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study examined experiences of patients and caregivers who received virtual multidisciplinary pain treatment (MDT) for pediatric chronic pain between March 2020 and August 2021. METHODS: A mixed methods design was implemented using qualitative interviews and quantitative satisfaction surveys. Satisfaction surveys were administered to a convenience sample of patients (aged 8 to 18; N = 20) and their caregivers (N = 20) who received MDT through an outpatient hospital pediatric chronic pain program. Interviews were conducted with a subset of these patients and their caregivers (n = 6). RESULTS: Analysis of interviews revealed four themes: 1) benefits of virtual care; 2) challenges of virtual care; 3) recommendations and evaluation of virtual care; and 4) patient preferences. Analysis of the satisfaction survey data revealed that while patients and caregivers were satisfied with many aspects of virtual care, 65% (n = 13) of patients reported a preference for in-person appointments, with caregivers showing equal preference for in-person and virtual appointments, though this was a non-significant difference (p = .37). Overall, both patients and caregivers stated a stronger preference for in-person physiotherapy sessions but were willing to have psychology sessions provided virtually. Finally, the most reported preference was for a hybrid model of care incorporating at least some in-person contact with providers. CONCLUSION: This study provides a rich exploration of virtual care for multidisciplinary pediatric chronic pain treatment. The current results may inform the future development of guidelines for virtual care delivery with pediatric chronic pain populations.",0
Surgical service and distance traveled drive patient preference for Care Hotel: a retrospective cohort study.,"Mayo Clinic's Care Hotel is a virtual hybrid care model which allows postoperative patients to recover in a comfortable environment after a low-risk procedure. Hospitals need to understand the key patient factors that promote acceptance of the Care Hotel if they are to benefit from this innovative care model. This study aims to identify factors that can predict whether a patient will stay at Care Hotel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective chart review of 1065 patients was conducted between 23 July 2020, and 31 December 2021. Variables examined included patient age, sex, race, ethnicity, Charlson comorbidity index, distance patient travelled to hospital, length of surgery, day of the week of surgery, and surgical service. Associations of patient and surgery characteristics with the primary outcome of staying at the Care Hotel were assessed using unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of the 1065 patients who met criteria for admission to the Care Hotel during the study period, 717 (67.3%) chose to stay at the Care Hotel while 328 (32.7%) choose to be admitted to the hospital. In multivariable analysis, there was a significant association between surgical service and staying at the Care Hotel (P<0.001). Specifically, there was a higher likelihood of staying at the Care Hotel for patients from Neurosurgery [odds rato (OR)=1.86, P=0.004], Otorhinolaryngology (OR=2.70, P<0.001), and General Surgery (OR=2.75, P=0.002). Additionally, there was a higher likelihood of staying at the Care Hotel with distance travelled over 110 miles [OR (per each doubling)=1.10, P=0.007]. CONCLUSION: When developing a post-surgical care model for patients following outpatient procedures, the referring surgical service is a primary factor to consider in order to ensure patient acceptance, along with patient distance. This study can assist other healthcare organizations considering this model, as it provides guidance on which factors are most indicative of acceptance.",0
"Patients' Satisfaction with Obstetrics-Gynecology, and Pediatric Healthcare Services in Vietnam: A Multicentre Cross-Sectional Study.","PURPOSE: Despite improvements in maternal and child health in Vietnam, sustained efforts are required to improve healthcare quality and resolve persistent disparities, highlighting the universal significance of customer satisfaction in healthcare. This study aims to assess patient satisfaction with healthcare services and associated factors at obstetrics-gynecology and pediatric hospitals across different geographical areas in Vietnam. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2019 among 647 patients or caregivers of hospitalized children at three major obstetrics-gynecology and pediatric hospitals, representing different geographical areas in Northern Vietnam. A Ministry of Health-approved satisfaction instrument was utilized to assess patient satisfaction. The instrument included 31 items measuring five dimensions of perceived satisfaction. Exploratory factor analysis examined the construct validity of the satisfaction measurement, and multivariate linear regression determined the factors associated with patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Among the 643 participants, 520 were female (89.87%), and nearly half were aged 18-29 years old (43.7%). Factor analysis revealed three dimensions: ""Competency and Outcomes"", ""Accessibility and Procedures"", and ""Facilities and Equipment"", with mean domain scores of 4.6 ± 0.43, 4.28 ± 0.67, and 4.53 ± 0.51, respectively. The proportion of participants completely satisfied with overall service quality was 48.52%, and expectation met was 34.53%. Multivariate linear regression indicated that patients from hospitals in the Red River Delta region had higher satisfaction scores than those in the Middle region across all domains (p<0.05). Higher health insurance coverage was associated with increased satisfaction, while education level, economic status, and ethnicity also influenced satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The study revealed moderate to high levels of satisfaction among patients at three major obstetrics-gynecology and pediatric hospitals in northern Vietnam. The findings may provide useful evidence for implementing hospital quality control in Vietnam, focusing on patient-centered goals.",0
Public preferences for online medical consultations in China: a discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Online medical consultation (OMC) is significant to promote the utilization and accessibility of healthcare resources and save time on consultation. However, the usage and public acceptance rates of it are still low in China. Meanwhile, few studies have focused on consumers' demand of OMC services. This study aims to identify attributes that influence users' preference for OMC services, quantify the value of these characteristics, and compare their relative importance. METHODS: A nationwide discrete choice experiment was conducted to survey Chinese residents' preference choices for six attributes of OMC services. Conditional logit model and mixed logit model were used to analyze respondents' preference. Willingness to pay and heterogeneity were estimated by the mixed logit model. RESULTS: A total of 856 respondents completed the study, and 668 questionnaires passed the consistency test. All of 6 attributes in the study were statistically significant except for ""Doctor's professional title - Associate Senior."" When choosing OMC services, respondents preferred to spend as little time and money as possible on a large online medical platform to consult a high-rated physician with a senior title from a well-known Grade-A tertiary hospital. Besides, respondents valued doctor's evaluation score most and were willing to pay ¥107 to obtain the services of higher-scored doctors. CONCLUSION: The study measured Chinese residents' preferences for six attributes of OMC and showed the heterogeneity of attributes among subgroups. Our findings suggested that OMC services providers should reduce the customers' waiting time, improve the quality of services and enhance professional skills to meet the customers' requirements. More research on preferences for OMC needs to be conducted in China, especially for key populations such as patients with chronic diseases.",1
Who Benefits From Hip Arthroplasty or Knee Arthroplasty? Preoperative Patient-reported Outcome Thresholds Predict Meaningful Improvement.,"BACKGROUND: Hip arthroplasty (HA) and knee arthroplasty (KA) are high-volume procedures. However, there is a debate about the quality of indication; that is, whether surgery is truly indicated in all patients. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) may be used to determine preoperative thresholds to differentiate patients who will likely benefit from surgery from those who will not. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What were the minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) for three commonly used PROMs in a large population of patients undergoing HA or KA treated in a general orthopaedic practice? (2) Do patients who reach the MCID differ in important ways from those who do not? (3) What preoperative PROM score thresholds best distinguish patients who achieve a meaningful improvement 12 months postsurgery from those who do not? (4) Do patients with preoperative PROM scores below thresholds still experience gains after surgery? METHODS: Between October 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020, 4182 patients undergoing HA and 3645 patients undergoing KA agreed to be part of the PROMoting Quality study and were hence included by study nurses in one of nine participating German hospitals. From a selected group of 1843 patients with HA and 1546 with KA, we derived MCIDs using the anchor-based change difference method to determine meaningful improvements. Second, we estimated which preoperative PROM score thresholds best distinguish patients who achieve an MCID from those who do not, using the preoperative PROM scores that maximized the Youden index. PROMs were Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function short form (HOOS-PS) (scored 0 to 100 points; lower indicates better health), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function short form (KOOS-PS) (scored 0 to 100 points; lower indicates better health), EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) (scored -0.661 to 1 points; higher indicates better health), and a 10-point VAS for pain (perceived pain in the joint under consideration for surgery within the past 7 days) (scored 0 to 10 points; lower indicates better health). The performance of derived thresholds is reported using the Youden index, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, geometric mean as a measure of central tendency, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: MCIDs for the EQ-5D-5L were 0.2 for HA and 0.2 for KA, with a maximum of 1 point, where higher values represented better health-related quality of life. For the pain scale, they were -0.9 for HA and -0.7 for KA, of 10 points (maximum), where lower scores represent lower pain. For the HOOS-PS, the MCID was -10, and for the KOOS-PS it was -5 of 100 points, where lower scores represent better functioning. Patients who reached the MCID differed from patients who did not reach the MCID with respect to baseline PROM scores across the evaluated PROMs and for both HA and KA. Patients who reached an MCID versus those who did not also differed regarding other aspects including education and comorbidities, but this was not consistent across PROMs and arthroplasty type. Preoperative PROM score thresholds for HA were 0.7 for EQ-5D-5L (Youden index: 0.55), 42 for HOOS-PS (Youden index: 0.27), and 3.5 for the pain scale (Youden index: 0.47). For KA, the thresholds were 0.6 for EQ-5D-5L (Youden index: 0.57), 39 for KOOS-PS (Youden index: 0.25), and 6.5 for the pain scale (Youden index: 0.40). A higher Youden index for EQ-5D-5L than for the other PROMs indicates that the thresholds for EQ-5D-5L were better for distinguishing patients who reached a meaningful improvement from those who did not. Patients who did not reach the thresholds could still achieve MCIDs, especially for functionality and the pain scale. CONCLUSION: We found that patients who experienced meaningful improvements (MCIDs) mainly differed from those who did not regarding their preoperative PROM scores. We further identified that patients undergoing HA or KA with a score above 0.7 or 0.6, respectively, on the EQ-5D-5L, below 42 or 39 on the HOOS-PS or KOOS-PS, or below 3.5 or 6.5 on a 10-point joint-specific pain scale presurgery had no meaningful benefit from surgery. The thresholds can support clinical decision-making. For example, when thresholds indicate that a meaningful improvement is not likely to be achieved after surgery, other treatment options may be prioritized. Although the thresholds can be used as support, patient preferences and medical expertise must supplement the decision. Future studies might evaluate the utility of using these thresholds in practice, examine how different thresholds can be combined as a multidimensional decision tool, and derive presurgery thresholds based on additional PROMs used in practice. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Preoperative PROM score thresholds in this study will support clinicians in decision-making through objective measures that can improve the quality of the recommendation for surgery.",0
Efficiency and Impact of Hypnoanalgesia for Cardiac Catheterisation in Paediatric Population.,"Hypnoanalgesia is a promising non-pharmacologic adjunct technique in paediatric interventions. Its safety, efficiency, and impacts on paediatric cardiac catheterisation (CC) are unknown. METHODS: In a prospective study, patients aged <16 years who underwent CC under hypnoanalgesia from January to December 2021 were included. Pain and anxiety were assessed using the analgesia nociception index (ANI) and the visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included; the mean age was 10.5 years, and the mean weight was 37 kg. Catheterisations were interventional in 10 patients (62.5%). Hypnoanalgesia indications were general anaesthesia (GA) contraindication in four patients (25.0%), the need for accurate pressure measurements in three patients (18.7%), and interventionist/patient preferences in nine (56.3%). CC was accomplished in 15 patients (93.7%), even in complicated cases. In one case, pulmonary artery pressures were normalised compared to previous catheterisation under local anaesthesia alone. The VAS score was under 5/10 for all patients. The ANI remained above 50 (no painful zone) for all but one patient. There was no significant decrease in the ANI during the intervention compared to the baseline (p = 0.62). No complications were reported. CONCLUSION: Paediatric CC is feasible and safe under hypnoanalgesia, even in complicated cases. Hypnoanalgesia was efficient in managing pain and stress, and it ensures more reliable pressure measurements.",0
Active surveillance should be considered for select men with Grade Group 2 prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment decisions for localized prostate cancer must balance patient preferences, oncologic risk, and preservation of sexual, urinary and bowel function. While Active Surveillance (AS) is the recommended option for men with Grade Group 1 (Gleason Score 3 + 3 = 6) prostate cancer without other intermediate-risk features, men with Grade Group 2 (Gleason Score 3 + 4 = 7) are typically recommended active treatment. For select patients, AS can be a possible initial management strategy for men with Grade Group 2. Herein, we review current urology guidelines and the urologic literature regarding recommendations and evidence for AS for this patient group. MAIN BODY: AS benefits men with prostate cancer by maintaining their current quality of life and avoiding treatment side effects. AS protocols with close follow up always allow for an option to change course and pursue curative treatment. All the major guideline organizations now include Grade Group 2 disease with slightly differing definitions of eligibility based on risk using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, clinical stage, and other factors. Selected men with Grade Group 2 on AS have similar rates of deferred treatment and metastasis to men with Grade Group 1 on AS. There is a growing body of evidence from randomized controlled trials, large observational (prospective and retrospective) cohorts that confirm the oncologic safety of AS for these men. While some men will inevitably conclude AS at some point due to clinical reclassification with biopsy or imaging, some men may be able to stay on AS until transition to watchful waiting (WW). Magnetic resonance imaging is an important tool to confirm AS eligibility, to monitor progression and guide prostate biopsy. CONCLUSION: AS is a viable initial management option for well-informed and select men with Grade Group 2 prostate cancer, low volume of pattern 4, and no other adverse clinicopathologic findings following a well-defined monitoring protocol. In the modern era of AS, urologists have tools at their disposal to better stage patients at initial diagnosis, risk stratify patients, and gain information on the biologic potential of a patient's prostate cancer.",0
"Surveillance Imaging Strategies for Pituitary Adenomas: When, How Frequent, and When to Stop.","OBJECTIVE: To describe a practical approach of when and how often to perform imaging, and when to stop imaging pituitary adenomas (PAs). METHODS: A literature review was carried out and recommendations provided are derived largely from personal experience. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging is the mainstay imaging modality of choice in the assessment, treatment planning, and follow-up of PAs. These adenomas are discovered incidentally during imaging for a variety of unrelated conditions, because of clinical symptoms related to mass effects on the adjacent structures, or during workup for functional alterations of the adenoma. Imaging is also used in the preoperative and postoperative phases of assessment of PAs, for surgical and radiotherapy planning, for postoperative surveillance to assess for adenoma stability and detection of adenoma recurrence, and for surveillance to monitor for adenoma growth in unoperated PAs. Currently, because there are no evidence-based consensus recommendations, the optimal strategy for surveillance imaging of PAs is not clearly established. Younger age, initial adenoma size, extrasellar extension, mass effect, cavernous sinus invasion, functional status, histopathologic characteristics, cost considerations, imaging accessibility, patient preference, and patient contraindications (eg, implanted metallic devices and patient claustrophobia) are all important factors that influence the strategy for surveillance imaging. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a practical approach of performing surveillance imaging strategies for PAs that should be individualized based on clinical presentation, history, adenoma morphology on imaging, and histopathologic characteristics.",0
Establishment of Prospective Registry of Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: The Korean Urological Oncology Society Database.,"PURPOSE: To establish a prospective registry for the active surveillance (AS) of prostate cancer (PC) using the Korean Urological Oncology Society (KUOS) database and to present interim analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The KUOS registry of AS for PC (KUOS-AS-PC) was organized in May 2019 and comprises multiple institutions nationwide. The eligibility criteria were as follows: patients with (1) pathologically proven PC; (2) pre-biopsy prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤20 ng/mL; (3) International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 1 or 2 (no cribriform pattern 4); (4) clinical T stage ≤T2c; (5) positive core ratio ≤50%; and (6) maximal cancer involvement in the core ≤50%. Detailed longitudinal clinical information, including multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging and disease-specific outcomes, was recorded. RESULTS: From May 2019 to June 2021, 296 patients were enrolled, and 284 were analyzed. The mean±standard deviation (SD) age at enrollment was 68.7±8.2 years. The median follow-up period was 11.2 months (5.9-16.8 mo). Majority of patients had pre-biopsy PSA ≤10 ng/mL (91.2%), PSA density <0.2 ng/mL² (79.7%), ISUP grade group 1 (94.4%), single positive core (65.7%), maximal cancer involvement in the core ≤20% (78.1%), and clinical T stage of T1c or lower (72.9%). Fifty-two (18.3%) discontinued AS for various reasons. Interventions included radical prostatectomy (80.8%), transurethral prostatectomy (5.8%), primary androgen deprivation therapy (5.8%), radiation (5.8%), and focal therapy (1.9%). The mean±SD time to intervention was 8.9±5.2 months. The reasons for discontinuation included pathologic reclassification (59.6%), patient preference (25.0%), and radiologic reclassification (9.6%). Two (4.8%) patients with pathologic Gleason score upgraded to ISUP grade group 4, no biochemical recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The KUOS established a successful prospective database of PC patients undergoing AS in Korea, named the KUOS-AS-PC registry.",0
Patient preferences and willingness-to-pay for community pharmacy-led Medicare Part D consultation services: A discrete choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Community pharmacies currently offer Medicare Part D consultation services, often at no-cost. Despite facilitating plan-switching behavior, identifying potential cost-savings, and increasing medication adherence, patient uptake of these services remains low. OBJECTIVES: To investigate patient preferences for specific service-offering attributes and marginal willingness-to-pay (mWTP) for an enhanced community pharmacy Medicare Part D consultation service. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) guided by the SERVQUAL framework was developed and administered using a national online survey panel. Study participants were English-speaking adults (≥65 years) residing in the United States enrolled in a Medicare Part D or Medicare Advantage plan and had filled a prescription at a community pharmacy within the last 12 months. An orthogonal design resulted in 120 paired-choice tasks distributed equally across 10 survey blocks. Data were analyzed using mixed logit and latent class models. RESULTS: In total, 540 responses were collected, with the average age of respondents being 71 years. The majority of respondents were females (60%) and reported taking four or more prescription medication (51%). Service attribute levels with the highest utility were: 15-min intervention duration (0.392), discussion of services + a follow-up phone call (0.069), in-person at the pharmacy (0.328), provided by a pharmacist the patient knew (0.578), and no-cost (3.382). The attribute with the largest mWTP value was a service provided by a pharmacist the participant knew ($8.42). Latent class analysis revealed that patient preferences for service attributes significantly differed by gender and difficulty affording prescription medications. CONCLUSIONS: Quantifying patient preference using discrete choice methodology provides pharmacies with information needed to design service offerings that balance patient preference and sustainability. Pharmacies may consider providing interventions at no-cost to subsets of patients placing high importance on a service cost attribute. Further, patient preference for 15-min interventions may inform Medicare Part D service delivery and facilitate service sustainability.",1
Evaluating the Efficiency of Survey Collection Methods to Trauma Patients.,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic injury survivors often experience negative health consequences, impacting recovery. No studies have assessed the feasibility of evaluating the resiliency of hospitalized trauma patients using the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10). PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the most efficient method to collect survey responses on the CD-RISC-10. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a convenience sample of admitted patients with traumatic injury. Patients were randomized to complete the CD-RISC-10 using pen and paper, tablet, or workstation on wheels. RESULTS: Of the 161 patient surveys, the tablet-based survey took the shortest time to complete (2 minutes, 21 seconds), and the paper survey resulted in the lowest percentage of missed questions (0.5%). Trauma patients reported high levels of resiliency. CONCLUSION: The CD-RISC-10 can be easily administered to trauma patients. Clinicians should balance efficiency and patient preferences when deciding on a survey collection method.",0
In-office needle arthroscopy is a cost-effective alternative for operating room diversion in medial meniscectomy: a financial analysis.,"BACKGROUND: In-office needle arthroscopy (IONA) has been described as a diagnostic alternative to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for intra-articular pathology. However, few studies have analyzed its impact on cost and wait times when used as a therapeutic intervention. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact on cost and wait times associated with offering IONA for partial medial meniscectomy as an alternative to traditional operating room (OR) arthroscopy for patients with irreparable medial meniscus tears on MRI. METHODS: Two models were created comparing the existing care pathway (current state) to a proposed future state utilizing IONA. Data sources were accounting data from an academically affiliated hospital in Canada and supplemented with literature values. A Monte Carlo simulation combined with DuPont analysis running 10,000 simulations was conducted to calculate the revenue, expenses, profits, and effect on surgical waitlists (i.e., throughput) between the states. Sensitivity analyses examined the influence of patient preference and revision rates on profit and throughput. Two-sample Student's t test was performed (p < .05). RESULTS: An average of 198 (standard deviation (SD) 31) patients underwent arthroscopic meniscectomy or repair each year from 2016 to 2020. The IONA revision rate was calculated as 20.3%. Compared to the current state, annual expenses in the IONA pathway were significantly reduced ($266,912.68 versus $281,415.23, p < .0001), while improving throughput by 21.2% (3.54%). Sensitivity analysis revealed 10% of patients need to select IONA over traditional OR arthroscopy with the revision rate remaining below 40% for the proposed state profit to be higher than the current state. CONCLUSIONS: IONA is a cost-effective alternative to traditional OR arthroscopy in patients undergoing partial medial meniscectomy. The next steps are to assess patients' perceptions of IONA as an alternative to traditional OR arthroscopy, and to carry out clinical trials to determine the efficacy, patient-reported outcome metrics, and complications of IONA.",0
Patient-related outcomes and Oral Health-Related Quality of Life in endodontics.,"There is increased interest in outcome measures that complement the classic goal of endodontics, being the prevention and healing of apical periodontitis. Possible outcome measures can be subdivided into patient-centred outcomes (PCOs), encompassing data collected by nonpatients aiming to assess the effectiveness of an intervention and patient-reported outcomes (PROs), which are reported directly by the patient. PROs can be subsequently classed into PRO measures that ascertain patients' view of their symptoms, their functional status, and their health-related quality of life, and patient-reported experience measures that focus on aspects including the humanity of care, patient satisfaction, patient preference and adherence, personal costs, expectation fulfilment, and decision regrets. The present review aims to define various patient-related outcomes and discuss the literature available regarding PCOs and PROs in endodontics. This includes those proposed to assess the effectiveness of endodontic treatment for pulpitis and apical periodontitis for use in the development of European Society of Endodontology S3-level clinical practice guidelines that have been included by all working groups, except for the radiographic assessment of apical periodontitis. Based on limited evidence in the field, it can be summarized that after recall periods of various lengths, endodontic treatment is associated with a high likelihood of tooth survival and limited need for further intervention, including extraction and further restorative procedures. Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) is likely to improve following the completion of treatment. Nonetheless, the literature assessing the association between OHRQoL and endodontics is hampered by the use of instruments that have not been previously validated. Amongst the remaining outcome measures discussed in the present review, it is worth highlighting that there is only one study assessing exacerbations in teeth with the presence of endodontic pathosis, which suggests a very low incidence of this adverse effect following endodontic treatment. Patients' expectation fulfilment, adherence, and satisfaction are closely inter-related and depend also on various nonclinical factors. Further studies assessing PCOs and PROs, in association with healing and prevention of apical periodontitis, are required to better understand endodontic treatment from the perspective of patients.",0
Patient Preferences for Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests in Light of Lowering the Screening Age to 45 Years.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: In 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force lowered the colorectal cancer (CRC) screening age to 45 years. We used conjoint analysis, a method that assesses complex decision making, to update our understanding on people's CRC screening test preferences in the context of new guidelines. METHODS: We conducted a conjoint analysis survey among unscreened individuals ≥40 years at average risk for CRC to determine the relative importance of screening test attributes in their decision making (eg, modality, effectiveness at reducing CRC risk, bowel prep). We also performed simulations to estimate the proportion of people who would prefer each US Multi-Society Task Force (MSTF) on CRC-recommended test. The analyses were stratified among those aged 40-49 years (newly or soon-to-be eligible for screening) and ≥50 years (have been eligible). RESULTS: Overall, 1000 participants completed the conjoint analysis (40-49 years, n = 456; ≥50 years, n = 544). When considering all 5 US MSTF-recommended tests, there were differences in test preferences between age groups (P = .019), and the most preferred test was a fecal immunochemical test (FIT)-fecal DNA every 3 years: 40-49 years, 34.6%; ≥50 years, 37.3%. When considering only the US MSTF tier 1 tests, most 40- to 49- (68.9%) and ≥50-year-olds (77.4%; P = .004) preferred an annual FIT over a colonoscopy every 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that more than one-third of people may want to do a FIT-fecal DNA every 3 years for their CRC screening. When only considering US MSTF tier 1 tests, three-fourths of people may prefer an annual FIT over colonoscopy. Further research examining CRC screening test preferences among broader populations is warranted to inform and enhance screening programs.",1
Refusal of Retreatment With Topical 5-Fluorouracil Among Patients With Actinic Keratosis: Qualitative Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Actinic keratosis (AK) is a common premalignant skin lesion, and topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is commonly used in field-directed therapy. However, 5-FU is associated with frequent local skin reactions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to qualitatively assess experiences among patients with AK who refuse retreatment with 5-FU. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 adult participants who had received treatment with 5-FU for AK between January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2020, and refused future treatment with 5-FU. Results were analyzed using qualitative research methods. RESULTS: Although most participants had low concern upon having received a diagnosis of AK, most felt that treatment is very important. When initiating treatment with 5-FU, most cited recommendation by their health care professionals as the primary motivator and initially had low concern regarding treatment. The side effects associated with treatment were physically and psychosocially burdensome for most participants and led to temporary lifestyle adjustments. After treatment, most did not believe that their health care provider prepared them for treatment or were unsure. While half of the participants felt that 5-FU helped treat AKs, half were either unsure, due to premature discontinuation, or did not think that 5-FU treated their AKs. CONCLUSIONS: 5-FU is one of the most commonly prescribed treatments for AKs, yet most patients experienced both a physical and psychosocial burden with the treatment. Inability to assess efficacy due to premature discontinuation secondary to 5-FU-related reactions is common, and shared decision-making, navigating treatment options, and taking into account patient preferences may be critical to help assure better adherence and outcomes. Although our study was limited by input from participants who refused future treatment with 5-FU, most stated that they would still continue to seek treatment for AKs in the future and would consider other topical treatments, especially if associated with a milder tolerability profile.",0
Patient Risk-Benefit Preferences for Transcatheter Versus Surgical Mitral Valve Repair.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) of mitral regurgitation is less invasive than surgery but has greater 5-year mortality and reintervention risks, and leads to smaller improvements in physical functioning. The study objective was to quantify patient preferences for risk-benefit trade-offs associated with TEER and surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: A discrete choice experiment survey was administered to patients with mitral regurgitation. Attributes included procedure type; 30-day mortality risk; 5-year mortality risk and physical functioning for 5 years; number of hospitalizations in the next 5 years; and risk of additional surgery in the next 5 years. A mixed-logit regression model was fit to estimate preference weights. Two hundred one individuals completed the survey: 63% were female and mean age was 74 years. On average, respondents preferred TEER over surgery. To undergo a less invasive procedure (ie, TEER), respondents would accept up to a 13.3% (95% CI, 8.7%-18.5%) increase in reintervention risk above a baseline of 10%, 4.6 (95% CI, 3.1-6.2) more hospitalizations above a baseline of 1, a 10.7% (95% CI, 6.5%-14.5%) increase in 5-year mortality risk above a baseline of 20%, or more limited physical functioning representing nearly 1 New York Heart Association class (0.7 [95% CI, 0.4-1.1]) over 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in general preferred TEER over surgery. When holding constant all other factors, a functional improvement from New York Heart Association class III to class I maintained over 5 years would be needed, on average, for patients to prefer surgery over TEER.",1
A surgical decision aid for occipital neuralgia with literature review and single center case series.,"BACKGROUND: Occipital neuralgia (ON) is a debilitating headache disorder. Due to the rarity of this disorder and lack of high-level evidence, a clear framework for choosing the optimal surgical approach for medically refractory ON incorporating shared decision making with patients does not exist. METHODS: A literature review of studies reporting pain outcomes of patients who underwent surgical treatment for ON was performed, as well as a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent surgery for ON within our institution. RESULTS: Thirty-two articles met the inclusion criteria. A majority of the articles were retrospective case series (22/32). The mean number of patients across the studies was 34 (standard deviation (SD) 39). Among the 13 studies that reported change in pain score on 10-point scales, a study of 20 patients who had undergone C2 and/or C3 ganglionectomies reported the greatest reduction in pain intensity after surgery. The studies evaluating percutaneous ablative methods including radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation showed the smallest reduction in pain scores overall. At our institution from 2014 to 2023, 11 patients received surgical treatment for ON with a mean follow-up of 187 days (SD 426). CONCLUSION: Based on these results, the first decision aid for selecting a surgical approach to medically refractory ON is presented. The algorithm prioritizes nerve sparing followed by non-nerve sparing techniques with the incorporation of patient preference. Shared decision making is critical in the treatment of ON given the lack of clear scientific evidence regarding the superiority of a particular surgical method.",0
Comparison of the effectiveness of local anesthesia for the digital block between single-volar subcutaneous and double-dorsal finger injections: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials.,"Local anesthesia is an effective method to perform digital nerve blocks. In this study, we compare the effectiveness of single-volar subcutaneous and double-dorsal injection through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to 7 April 2021 was performed. RCTs with the effects of single-volar subcutaneous and double-dorsal injection were eligible. Meta-analysis was performed using random effect models with pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RoB 2.0 and GRADE of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria were applied for evaluating the bias. A total of 2484 studies were initially identified, with 11 eligible RCTs finally included in the meta-analysis (1363 patients). The pooled data of nine studies showed single-volar injection had a statistically significantly lower pain score (pooled SMD: 0.20, 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.39, p = 0.041, I2 = 58%, N = 1187) and higher patient preference but invalid anesthesia at the dorsal proximal digit. No significant differences were observed in the onset of anesthesia, adjacent digit invalid numbness, distal phalanx invalid anesthesia, additional injection rate, and adverse effects. In conclusion, this meta-analysis of RCTs showed that the single-volar injection was associated with a lower pain sensation during injection and higher patient satisfaction with a reduced anesthetic effect over the proximal dorsal phalanx. Further high-quality RCTs with a higher number of cases are needed to validate our results.",0
Radiotherapy Use in Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer: Review of the Guidelines and Impact of Increased Awareness in Patient Referral at a Tertiary Center in Belgium.,"PURPOSE: Pronounced underuse of radiotherapy (RT) in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is reported. This study aims to assess the awareness about the role of RT in different MIBC settings and see whether this has increased since 2017. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the bladder cancer guidelines of the EAU, ESMO, NCCN, NICE, and AUA/ASCO/ASTRO/SUO, focusing on the role of RT in MIBC. In 2017, we evaluated the use of RT in MIBC in Belgium. This raised awareness about the indications of RT in different MIBC settings. Here, we present a retrospective pattern of care analysis of the RT use for MIBC patients at our center from January 2012 until December 2021. Frequency of RT use, patient, disease and treatment characteristics were compared between two 5-year periods (2012-2016 and 2017-2021). RESULTS: Review of the guidelines suggested that RT can be used as a treatment option in most MIBC settings. However, differences between guideline recommendations existed and high-level evidence was often lacking. Overall, 221 unique MIBC patients received RT at our center. RT use for MIBC was 39% higher in the second 5-year period (Between the same periods, the number of new MIBC registrations increased with 26%). The most pronounced increase, ie, 529%, was observed in the primary setting and was in parallel with patient preference becoming the main indication for RT. Participation in clinical trials seems to have had an important impact on the frequency of RT use in the adjuvant and metastatic setting. CONCLUSION: We provide a critical overview of the RT indications in MIBC as recommended by the international guidelines. Increased awareness about RT as a treatment option in MIBC seems to have an impact on the treatment choice in clinical practice, as was observed in our tertiary center.",0
First-in-man report of transsubclavian venous implantation of the Aveir leadless cardiac pacing system.,"INTRODUCTION: Transsubclavian venous implantation of the Aveir leadless cardiac pacemaker (LCP) has not been previously reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three cases of transsubclavian implantation of the Aveir LCP are reported. Two cases were postbilateral orthotopic lung transplant, without appropriate femoral or jugular access due to recent ECMO cannulation and jugular central venous catheters. In one case, there was strong patient preference for same-day discharge. Stability testing confirmed adequate fixation and electrical testing confirmed stable parameters in all cases. All patients tolerated the procedure well without significant immediate complications. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the feasibility of transsubclavian implantation of the Aveir LCP.",0
"Talking, not training, increased the accuracy of physicians' diagnosis of their patients' preferences for colon cancer screening.","OBJECTIVE: Identify if primary care physicians (PCPs) accurately understand patient preferences for colorectal cancer (CRC) testing, whether shared decision making (SDM) training improves understanding of patient preferences, and whether time spent discussing CRC testing improves understanding of patient preferences. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a trial comparing SDM training plus a reminder arm to a reminder alone arm. PCPs and their patients completed surveys after visits assessing whether they discussed CRC testing, patient testing preference, and time spent discussing CRC testing. We compared patient and PCP responses, calculating concordance between patient-physician dyads. Multilevel models tested for differences in preference concordance by arm or time discussing CRC. RESULTS: 382 PCP and patient survey dyads were identified. Most dyads agreed on whether CRC testing was discussed (82%). Only 52% of dyads agreed on the patient's preference. SDM training did not impact accuracy of PCPs preference diagnoses (55%v.48%,p = 0.22). PCPs were more likely to accurately diagnose patient's preferences when discussions occurred, regardless of length. CONCLUSION: Only half of PCPs accurately identified patient testing preferences. Training did not impact accuracy. Visits where CRC testing was discussed resulted in PCPs better understanding patient preferences. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: PCPs should take time to discuss testing and elicit patient preferences.",0
Recruiting women with ductal carcinoma in situ to a randomised controlled trial: lessons from the LORIS study.,"BACKGROUND: The LOw RISk DCIS (LORIS) study was set up to compare conventional surgical treatment with active monitoring in women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Recruitment to trials with a surveillance arm is known to be challenging, so strategies to maximise patient recruitment, aimed at both patients and recruiting centres, were implemented. METHODS: Women aged ≥ 46 years with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of non-high-grade DCIS were eligible for 1:1 randomisation to either surgery or active monitoring. Prior to randomisation, all eligible women were invited to complete: (1) the Clinical Trials Questionnaire (CTQ) examining reasons for or against participation, and (2) interviews exploring in depth opinions about the study information sheets and film. Women agreeing to randomisation completed validated questionnaires assessing health status, physical and mental health, and anxiety levels. Hospital site staff were invited to communication workshops and refresher site initiation visits to support recruitment. Their perspectives on LORIS recruitment were collected via surveys and interviews. RESULTS: Eighty percent (181/227) of eligible women agreed to be randomised. Over 40% of participants had high anxiety levels at baseline. On the CTQ, the most frequent most important reasons for accepting randomisation were altruism and belief that the trial offered the best treatment, whilst worries about randomisation and the influences of others were the most frequent most important reasons for declining. Most women found the study information provided clear and useful. Communication workshops for site staff improved knowledge and confidence but only about half said they themselves would join LORIS if eligible. The most common recruitment barriers identified by staff were low numbers of eligible patients and patient preference. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment to LORIS was challenging despite strategies aimed at both patients and site staff. Ensuring that recruiting staff support the study could improve recruitment in similar future trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN27544579, prospectively registered on 22 May 2014.",0
The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Ulcerative Colitis: Results from a Global Ulcerative Colitis Narrative Patient Survey.,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created challenges related to disease management of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The UC Narrative COVID-19 survey was conducted from August to December 2021 among adults with UC from the United States, Canada, Japan, France, and Finland. Patients were questioned on disease management, health care access and experience, and preferences for interactions with their doctor. Data were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: In total, 584 patients qualified for and completed the survey. Compared with 2019, 25% experienced more flares during the pandemic (from early 2020). Most patients (88%) taking prescription medication were very/somewhat satisfied with their current treatment plan; 53% were hesitant to make changes during the pandemic. Factors that patients agreed helped control UC symptoms during the pandemic included fewer social outings (37%), working from home (29%), and less busy schedules (28%). Greater anxiety/stress (43%) and hesitancy to visit a hospital/office (34%) made the control of UC symptoms more difficult. Compared with 2019, more patients relied on certain alternative support systems during the pandemic. Patients who used in-person and virtual appointments were equally very satisfied/satisfied with the quality of care (both 81%). In-person appointments were preferred by 68% of patients when meeting a new doctor, 55% when experiencing a flare, and 52% for regular check-ups; 41% preferred virtual appointments for UC prescription refills. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, most patients were satisfied with their current UC treatment plan and access to care; more patients relied on certain alternative UC management support systems, and many were impacted by anxiety/stress.",0
The best defence is a good offence: Ensuring equitable access to primary care in Canada.,"Ensuring access to primary care is a persistent challenge in Canada, and the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing gaps. Public policy reform that only partially addresses these access issues, technological opportunities, workforce desires, or patient preferences creates an opportunity for private, investor-owned corporations to take ownership of primary care delivery systems. This article summarizes the history of the ""public-private"" conversation as it pertains to primary care, with a particular focus on investor-owned corporations. We outline how profit-driven, corporate healthcare impacts equitable access to care, increases spending on low-value services, and undermines the underlying values of Canadian healthcare systems. All of healthcare delivery requires rapid regulation and oversight by policy-makers, which would increase transparency of corporate care. There also must be parallel efforts placed on addressing the long-standing issues in publicly funded delivery of primary care that created the space for corporate care to grow.",0
"A review of evidence, antimicrobial stability, and feasibility considerations for OPAT continuous infusion.","Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) has been widely used in clinical practice for many decades because of its associated cost savings, reductions in inpatient hospital days, and decreases in hospital-associated infections. Despite this long history, evolving practice patterns and new drug delivery devices continue to present challenges as well as opportunities for clinicians when designing appropriate outpatient antimicrobial regimens. One such change is the increasing use of extended and continuous infusion (CI) of antimicrobials to optimize the achievement of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic targets. Elastomeric devices are also becoming increasingly popular in OPAT, including for the delivery of CI. In this article, we review the clinical evidence for CI in OPAT, as well as practical considerations of patient preferences, cost, and antimicrobial stability.",0
Regional control after precision lymph node dissection for clinically evident melanoma metastasis.,"INTRODUCTION: Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for microscopic lymph node metastases has been replaced by observation; however, CLND is standard for clinically detectable nodal metastases (cLN). CLND has high morbidity, which may be reduced by excision of only the cLN (precision lymph node dissection [PLND]). We hypothesized that same-basin recurrence risk would be low after PLND. METHODS: Retrospective review at four tertiary care hospitals identified patients who underwent PLND. The primary outcome was 3-year cumulative incidence of isolated same-basin recurrence. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients underwent PLND for cLN without synchronous distant metastases. Reasons for forgoing CLND included patient preference (n = 11), comorbidities (n = 5), imaging indeterminate for distant metastases (n = 2), partial response to checkpoint blockade (n = 1), or not reported (n = 2). A median of 2 nodes (range: 1-6) were resected at PLND, and 68% contained melanoma. Recurrence was observed in 33% overall. Only 1 patient (5%) developed an isolated same-basin recurrence. Cumulative incidences at 3 years were 5.0%, 17.3%, and 49.7% for isolated same-basin recurrence, any same-basin recurrence, and any recurrence, respectively. Complications from PLND were reported in 1 patient (5%). CONCLUSIONS: These pilot data suggest that PLND may provide adequate regional disease control with less morbidity than CLND. These data justify prospective evaluation of PLND in select patients.",0
Translation and Cultural Adaptation of the Preferences for Everyday Living Inventory for Korean Nursing Home Settings.,"Valid and reliable measures are necessary to provide person-centered care. However, there are no such measures in Korean nursing home (NH) settings. The purpose of the current study was to translate and culturally adapt the Preferences for Everyday Living Inventory (PELI) into Korean following the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research guidelines. Face validity was assessed by cognitively capable Korean older adults (N = 10) using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree). Mean score was 2.7 (SD = 0.82) for grammar and wording; 3.7 (SD = 0.48) for understandability; and 3.7 (SD = 0.67) for cultural relevance. Participants found the Korean version of the PELI (PELI-K) easy to understand and interpret, and culturally relevant. Results suggest that the PELI was successfully translated and culturally adapted to Korean. Implementing the PELI-K in Korean NHs and incorporating individual preferences into care delivery will improve quality of care. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 49(5), 5-10.].",0
Public Preferences for Introducing a COVID-19 Certificate: A Discrete Choice Experiment in the Netherlands.,"OBJECTIVE: Here we investigate public preferences for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) certificates in the Netherlands, and whether these preferences differ between subgroups in the population. METHODS: A survey including a discrete choice experiment was administered to 1500 members of the adult population of the Netherlands. Each participant was asked to choose between hypothetical COVID-19 certificates that differed in seven attributes: the starting date, and whether the certificate allowed gathering with multiple people, shopping without appointment, visiting bars and restaurants, visiting cinemas and theatres, attending events, and practising indoor sports. Latent class models (LCMs) were used to determine the attribute relative importance and predicted acceptance rate of hypothetical certificates. RESULTS: Three classes of preference patterns were identified in the LCM. One class a priori opposed a certificate (only two attributes influencing preferences), another class was relatively neutral and included all attributes in their decision making, and the final class was positive towards a certificate. Respondents aged > 65 years and those who plan to get vaccinated were more likely to belong to the latter two classes. Being allowed to shop without appointment and to visit bars and restaurants was most important to all respondents, increasing predicted acceptance rate by 12 percentage points. CONCLUSIONS: Preferences for introduction of a COVID-19 certificate are mixed. A certificate that allows for shopping without appointment and visiting bars and restaurants is likely to increase acceptance. The support of younger citizens and those who plan to get vaccinated seems most sensitive to the specific freedoms granted by a COVID-19 certificate.",1
