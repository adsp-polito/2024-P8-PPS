An Actionable Expert-System Algorithm to Support Nurse-Led Cancer Survivorship Care: Algorithm Development Study.,"BACKGROUND: Comprehensive models of survivorship care are necessary to improve access to and coordination of care. New models of care provide the opportunity to address the complexity of physical and psychosocial problems and long-term health needs experienced by patients following cancer treatment. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents our expert-informed, rules-based survivorship algorithm to build a nurse-led model of survivorship care to support men living with prostate cancer (PCa). The algorithm is called No Evidence of Disease (Ned) and supports timelier decision-making, enhanced safety, and continuity of care. METHODS: An initial rule set was developed and refined through working groups with clinical experts across Canada (eg, nurse experts, physician experts, and scientists; n=20), and patient partners (n=3). Algorithm priorities were defined through a multidisciplinary consensus meeting with clinical nurse specialists, nurse scientists, nurse practitioners, urologic oncologists, urologists, and radiation oncologists (n=17). The system was refined and validated using the nominal group technique. RESULTS: Four levels of alert classification were established, initiated by responses on the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice survey, and mediated by changes in minimal clinically important different alert thresholds, alert history, and clinical urgency with patient autonomy influencing clinical acuity. Patient autonomy was supported through tailored education as a first line of response, and alert escalation depending on a patient-initiated request for a nurse consultation. CONCLUSIONS: The Ned algorithm is positioned to facilitate PCa nurse-led care models with a high nurse-to-patient ratio. This novel expert-informed PCa survivorship care algorithm contains a defined escalation pathway for clinically urgent symptoms while honoring patient preference. Though further validation is required through a pragmatic trial, we anticipate the Ned algorithm will support timelier decision-making and enhance continuity of care through the automation of more frequent automated checkpoints, while empowering patients to self-manage their symptoms more effectively than standard care.

Evaluation of patient participation in relation to the implementation of a person-centered nursing shift handover.,"BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that nursing shift-to-shift handover should be a more team-based dialogue with and for the patient rather than about a patient. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate patient participation in relation to the implementation of the person-centered handover (PCH). METHOD: A pretest-posttest design was used without a comparison group, including patients from nine units in a university hospital at pretest (n = 228) and after implementing PCH (posttest, n = 253) per the framework integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services. The PCH is inspired by an Australian bedside handover model. The Patient Preferences for the Patient Participation tool was used to rate the preference for and experience of participation on 12 items, combined into three levels of preference-based participation (insufficient-fair-sufficient). RESULTS: There were no differences regarding experience or preference-based participation between patients at pretest-posttest; however, posttest patients experienced participation in the item Reciprocal communication to a lesser extent than the pretest patients. Only 49% of the posttest group received PCH; of those not receiving PCH, some would have wanted PCH (27%), while some would have declined (24%). Patients receiving PCH had sufficient participation (82%), to a greater extent, regarding the item Sharing one's symptoms with staff than patients at pretest (72%). Patients receiving PCH also had sufficient participation, to a greater extent, than patients at posttest who did not receive, but would have wanted PCH, regarding four items: (1) sharing one's symptoms with staff, (2) reciprocal communication, (3) being told what was done, and (4) taking part in planning. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: Most patients want to be present at PCH. Therefore, nurses should ask for the patients' preferences regarding PCH and act accordingly. Not inviting patients who want PCH could contribute to insufficient patient participation. Further studies are needed to capture what assistance nurses would want in identifying and acting in alignment with patient preferences.",0
Understanding Patient Preferences Regarding the Important Determinants of Breast Cancer Treatment: A Narrative Scoping Review.,"OBJECTIVE: Conventionally, optimal treatment strategies for breast cancer have been largely determined by physicians, with a scant understanding of patients' treatment values and preferences. Incorporating patient preferences in the decision-making process for breast cancer treatment is gaining recognition and can potentially improve treatment outcomes and compliance. This scoping review aims to synthesize evidence on the key determinants that are most valued by breast cancer patients when deciding on their treatment options. METHODS: We searched three electronic databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and CINAHL Plus) utilizing a systematic scoping review method. Two reviewers independently screened, applied inclusion criteria, reviewed, and synthesized findings. A mixed-method narrative approach combining the inductive thematic analysis and content analysis methodologies was used to synthesize and summarize the findings. RESULTS: The review included 22 studies, leading to the conceptualization of 5 overarching themes and 17 sub-themes. Among these, the most frequently cited theme was treatment benefits, followed by treatment-related process, treatment-related risk, quality of life, and cost of treatment. Women with breast cancer highly value treatments that offer good effectiveness, prolong survival, prevent recurrence, and maintain quality of life. Patient concerns include treatment-related side effects, safety, the risk of secondary cancer, and direct or indirect out-of-pocket costs. Additionally, patients also consider treatment duration, mode of administration, physician recommendation, and treatment availability and accessibility when deciding on their preferred treatment. CONCLUSION: The evidence synthesized in this review offers insights into refining breast cancer treatment strategies to align more closely with patient values. Recognizing and integrating patient perspectives in breast cancer care could potentially lead to improved treatment outcomes, enhanced patient compliance, and more personalized care. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to incorporate these key determinants in their treatment decision-making processes, aiming to deliver a patient-centered care that aligns with the unique preferences and values of each patient.",1
Report of consensus panel 2 from the 11th international workshop on Waldenström's macroglobulinemia on the management of relapsed or refractory WM patients.,"The consensus panel 2 (CP2) of the 11th International Workshop on Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (IWWM-11) has reviewed and incorporated current data to update the recommendations for treatment approaches in patients with relapsed or refractory WM (RRWM). The key recommendations from IWWM-11 CP2 include: (1) Chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) and/or a covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase (cBTKi) strategies are important options; their use should reflect the prior upfront strategy and are subject to their availability. (2) In selecting treatment, biological age, co-morbidities and fitness are important; nature of relapse, disease phenotype and WM-related complications, patient preferences and hematopoietic reserve are also critical factors while the composition of the BM disease and mutational status (MYD88, CXCR4, TP53) should also be noted. (3) The trigger for initiating treatment in RRWM should utilize knowledge of patients' prior disease characteristics to avoid unnecessary delays. (4) Risk factors for cBTKi related toxicities (cardiovascular dysfunction, bleeding risk and concurrent medication) should be addressed when choosing cBTKi. Mutational status (MYD88, CXCR4) may influence the cBTKi efficacy, and the role of TP53 disruptions requires further study) in the event of cBTKi failure dose intensity could be up titrated subject to toxicities. Options after BTKi failure include CIT with a non-cross-reactive regimen to one previously used CIT, addition of anti-CD20 antibody to BTKi, switching to a newer cBTKi or non-covalent BTKi, proteasome inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors, and new anti-CD20 combinations are additional options. Clinical trial participation should be encouraged for all patients with RRWM.",0
Clinical documentation of patient identities in the electronic health record: Ethical principles to consider.,"The American Psychological Association's multicultural guidelines encourage psychologists to use language sensitive to the lived experiences of the individuals they serve. In organized care settings, psychologists have important decisions to make about the language they use in the electronic health record (EHR), which may be accessible to both the patient and other health care providers. Language about patient identities (including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation) is especially important, but little guidance exists for psychologists on how and when to document these identities in the EHR. Moreover, organizational mandates, patient preferences, fluid identities, and shifting language may suggest different documentation approaches, posing ethical dilemmas for psychologists to navigate. In this article, we review the purposes of documentation in organized care settings, review how each of the five American Psychological Association Code of Ethics' General Principles relates to identity language in EHR documentation, and propose a set of questions for psychologists to ask themselves and their patients when making choices about documenting identity variables in the EHR.

Epilepsy surgery perceptions among general neurologists and epilepsy specialists: A survey.,"OBJECTIVE: Surgical intervention for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) is a safe and efficacious evidence-based treatment. Yet, neurologists have historically revealed hesitance in referring patients for surgical evaluations. The present study surveyed general neurologists and epilepsy specialists to assess their views and process in referring patients for specialized epilepsy care and epilepsy surgery. METHODS: A 14-item survey assessing epilepsy referrals and views of epilepsy surgery was distributed to all neurologists currently practicing in a large national integrated health system using REDCap. Responses were qualitatively analyzed and differences between general neurologists and epileptologists were assessed using chi-squared tests. RESULTS: In total, 100 responses were received from 67 general neurologists and 33 epileptologists with several similarities and differences emerging between the two groups. Both groups endorsed surgery and neuromodulation as treatment options in DRE, felt that seizure frequency rather than duration was relevant in considering epilepsy surgery, and indicated patient preference as the largest barrier limiting epilepsy surgery. General neurologists were more likely to require ≥ 3 ASMs to fail to diagnose DRE compared to epileptologists (45% vs. 15%, p < 0.01) who more often required ≥ 2 ASMs to fail. Epileptologists were also more likely than neurologists to try a new ASM (75.8% vs. 53.7%, p < 0.05) or optimize the current ASM (75.8% vs. 49.3%, p < 0.05) in DRE. General neurologists were more likely to consider epilepsy surgery to be less efficacious (p = 0.001) or less safe (p < 0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, neurologists appear to have generally positive opinions of epilepsy surgery, which is a change from prior literature and represents a changing landscape of views toward this intervention. Furthermore, epileptologists and general neurologists endorsed more similarities than differences in their opinions of surgery and steps to referral, which is another encouraging finding. Those gaps that remain between epileptologists and general neurologists, particularly in standards of ASM prescription, may be addressed by more consistent education about DRE and streamlining of surgical referral procedures.",0
Study within a trial of electronic versus paper-based Patient-Reported oUtcomes CollEction (SPRUCE): study protocol for a partially randomised patient preference study.,"INTRODUCTION: Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) are currently collected from trial participants using paper questionnaires by the Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR-CTSU). Streamlining PRO collection using electronic questionnaires (ePRO) may improve data collection and patient experience. Here, we outline our protocol for a Study within a trial of electronic versus paper-based Patient-Reported oUtcomes CollEction (SPRUCE), which investigates the acceptability of ePRO in oncology clinical trials. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: SPRUCE was developed alongside patient and public contributors. SPRUCE runs in multiple host trials with a partially randomised patient preference design, allowing participants to be randomised or choose their preference of electronic or paper questionnaires. Questionnaires are scheduled in accordance with host trial follow-up. The primary objective will assess differences in return rates (compliance) between ePRO and paper PROs at the first timepoint post-host trial intervention in the randomised group. Paper PRO compliance is expected to be 90%. 244 randomised participants are required to exclude ≤80% compliance rates with ePRO (10% non-inferiority margin, with 80% power and one-sided alpha=0.05). SPRUCE aims to assess acceptability of ePRO in oncology clinical trials, establish whether ePRO is acceptable to ICR-CTSU trial participants and can capture complete PRO data, consistent with paper PROs. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The SPRUCE protocol (ICR-CTSU/2021/10074) was approved by the Coventry and Warwick Central Research Ethics Committee (21/WM/0223) on 21 October 2021. Results will be disseminated via presentations, publications and lay summaries. No participant identifiable data will be included. TRIAL REGISTRATION: SWAT169.",0
Physical therapists' perspectives of patient values and their place in clinical practice: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: In physical therapy practice patients and therapists exchange their perspectives on musculoskeletal health problems and their meaning for both of them. However, literature indicates that physical therapists find it difficult to enquire about the patients' values during clinical encounters. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to gain deeper insight into the perspectives of physical therapists about patient values. DESIGN: Explorative qualitative focus group study. METHOD: Twenty-three physical therapists were interviewed in the Netherlands from March to May 2021. Two researchers analyzed the interviews and derived relevant codes. After an iterative process of comparing, analyzing, conceptualizing and discussing the codes, themes were identified through a thematic framework, illustrated with meaningful quotes. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified: Humane, Tacit, and Responsive. It appeared that patient values play unconsciously a major role in daily practice and are associated with humanity, not technical or procedural aspects of the encounter. Responsive denotes that all values require interaction in which aligning with the individual patient forms the basis of treatment. Barriers for being responsive are identified as subthemes: Choices, Trust, Diverseness, and Boundaries. CONCLUSION: The concept of patient values appeared to be implicit. The professional intuitively attunes as a fellow human being to values and expectations of the individual patient. This study contributes to finding a balance and mutual reinforcement of implicit and explicit knowledge. With all found experiences and insights the concept of patient values became more explicit in physical therapy to create a framework for education and research in the future.",0
Effect of Utilizing Cheek Retractors on Patient Satisfaction and Trueness of Peripheral Borders in Maxillary Digital Scans for Totally Edentulous Patients: An In Vivo Study.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of cheek retractors on the accuracy of capturing peripheral borders in totally edentulous digital scans by comparing the conventional impression technique to digital scans made using two different cheek retractors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen edentulous maxillary impressions were made using three techniques: the conventional impression technique, using modeling thermoplastic compound and zinc oxide eugenol paste; the digital intraoral scanning technique using the DIO scan retractor (DIO); and using the Br.nemark lip retractor (BRAN). The control impressions of each patient were poured, scanned using a desktop scanner, then transferred into a three-dimensional analysis software. DIO and BRAN groups were scanned using an intraoral scanner, imported, and superimposed using best fit algorithm on the corresponding control. The root mean square for the whole surface and for particular interest regions were calculated to assess the degree of trueness. The patients' perceptions of the impression techniques were the secondary outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using the one sample T-test and Wilcoxon test (α=.05). RESULTS: Significant discrepancies were found for BRAN and DIO compared to the control. No significant discrepancies were found when comparing RMS of BRAN and DIO at different regions. Scan retractors had a significant impact on patient satisfaction, with patients preferring DIO. CONCLUSIONS: Edentulous intraoral scans made using cheek retractors had similar deviations when compared to each other but diverged from the conventional impression in edentulous maxilla. Patient preferences for intraoral scans over conventional impressions were confirmed. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The use of different retracting methods during intraoral scanning of totally edentulous maxillary arches does not affect the peripheral border registration.",0
Patient Engagement in and Adaptations to Delivery of Outpatient Care for Opioid Use Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"OBJECTIVE: The authors investigated adaptations to outpatient care delivery and changes in treatment demand and engagement among patients receiving medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in the months after the declaration of the COVID-19 public health emergency in 2020. METHODS: Data were collected through an online survey (June-November 2020) of outpatient MOUD prescribers. The survey obtained information on outpatient practices' adaptations to MOUD treatment and urine drug screening (UDS) and elicited provider views on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient demand for, and engagement in, treatment. Multivariable regression analyses were used to examine associations among practice characteristics, patient engagement, and service adaptations. RESULTS: Of 516 respondents, 74% reported adaptations to MOUD delivery during the pandemic. Most respondents implemented virtual visits for initial (67%) and follow-up (77%) contacts. Prescribers of buprenorphine were more likely than those who did not prescribe the medication to report MOUD adaptations. Among respondents reporting any MOUD adaptation, 77% made adaptations to their UDS practices. Among 513 respondents who answered COVID-19-related questions, 89% reported that the pandemic had affected the treatment and engagement of their patients. Of these respondents, 30% reported increased difficulty with patient engagement, and 45% reported that their patients preferred virtual visits during this period, whereas 18% endorsed patient preference for in-person visits. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth and federal regulatory easements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic enabled providers to continue treating patients for opioid use disorder in 2020. The results suggest that care adaptations and changes in patient demand and engagement were common in the practices surveyed.",0
Perspectives of Patients and Professionals on Patient Education in Complex Endovascular Aortic Repair.,"BACKGROUND: Misinterpretation of patient preferences in perioperative education can lead to an undesired treatment decision. This explorative interview study presents differences in perspectives of patients and professionals on patient education in complex endovascular aortic aneurysm management. METHODS: Using convenience sampling, a cross-sectional interview study was performed among patients who were in various stages of the decision-making process for complex endovascular aortic repair. Five physicians were interviewed, representing the main providers of clinical information. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed inductively. RESULTS: Twelve patients (mean age 76.6 [standard deviation: 6.4], 83% male) were interviewed. Ten (83%) felt like they had no other realistic option besides undergoing surgery, whereas all professionals (5/5) stressed the importance of delicate patient selection. Five patients out of 10 (50%) who commented on their preferred decisional role considered the professional's advice as decisive. All but 1 patient (11/12) reported that the information was easy to understand, whereas 4 out of 5 professionals (80%) doubted whether patients could fully comprehend everything. Patients experienced a lack of information on the recovery process, although professionals stated that this was addressed during consultation. CONCLUSIONS: Several differences were found in the perspectives of patients and professionals on education in complex aortic aneurysm management. In order to optimize patient involvement in decision-making, professionals should be aware of these possible discrepancies and address them during consultation. Future research could focus on these differences in more detail by including more patients depending on their treatment and decision stages.",0
A Discrete Choice Analysis Comparing COVID-19 Vaccination Decisions for Children and Adults.,"IMPORTANCE: COVID-19 vaccination rates in the US remain below optimal levels. Patient preferences for different attributes of vaccine products and the vaccination experience can be important in determining vaccine uptake decisions. OBJECTIVE: To assess preferences for attributes of adult and pediatric COVID-19 vaccination among US adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An online survey of a national panel of 1040 US adults was conducted in May and June 2021. A discrete choice analysis was used to measure the relative value of each attribute in the decision to choose a COVID-19 vaccination option for adults or children. Six attributes were used to described hypothetical vaccination options: vaccine effectiveness, mild side effects, rare adverse events, number of doses, time required for vaccination, and regulatory approval. Respondents chose between hypothetical vaccination profiles or no vaccination. Additional survey questions asked about vaccination beliefs, COVID-19 illness experience, COVID-19 risk factors, vaccination status, and opinions about the risk of COVID-19. EXPOSURES: Respondents chose which vaccine profile they would prefer to receive for themselves (or no vaccination). Respondents then considered an identical set of profiles for a hypothetical child aged 0 to 17 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Relative value of vaccination-related attributes were estimated using Bayesian logit regression. Preference profiles for subgroups were estimated using latent class analyses. RESULTS: A total of 1040 adults (610 [59%] female; 379 participants [36%] with an age of 55 years and older years) responded to the survey. When asked about vaccination choices for themselves, participants indicated that vaccine effectiveness (95% vs 60%) was a significant attribute (β, 9.59 [95% CrI, 9.20-10.00] vs β, 0.41 [95% CrI, 0-0.80]). Respondents also preferred fewer rare adverse events (β, 6.35 [95% CrI, 5.74-6.86), fewer mild side effects (β, 5.49; 95% CrI, 5.12-5.87), 1 dose (β, 5.41; 95% CrI, 5.04-5.78), FDA approval (β, 6.01; 95% CrI, 5.64-6.41), and shorter waiting times (β, 5.67; 95% CrI, 4.87-6.48). Results were very similar when framing the question as adult or child vaccination, with slightly stronger preference for fewer rare adverse events for children. Latent class analysis revealed 4 groups of respondents: (1) individuals sensitive to safety and regulatory status, (2) individuals sensitive to convenience, (3) individuals who carefully considered all attributes in making their choices, and (4) individuals who rejected the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this survey study of US adults, the identification of 4 distinct preference groups provides new information to guide communications to support vaccine decision making. In particular, the group that prioritize convenience (less time required for vaccination and fewer doses) may present an opportunity to create actionable strategies to increase vaccination uptake for both adult and pediatric populations.",1

A multi- and mixed-method adaptation study of a patient-centered perioperative mental health intervention bundle.,"BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression are common among older adults and can intensify during perioperative periods, but few mental health interventions are designed for older surgical patients' unique needs. As part of the feasibility trial, we developed and adapted a perioperative mental health (PMH) bundle for older patients comprised of behavioral activation (BA) and medication optimization (MO) to ameliorate anxiety and depressive symptoms before, during, and after cardiac, orthopedic, and oncologic surgery. METHODS: We used mixed-methods including workshop studios with patients, caregivers, clinicians, researchers, and interventionists; intervention refinement and reflection meetings; patient case review meetings; intervention session audio-recordings and documentation forms; and patient and caregiver semi-structured interviews. We used the results to refine our PMH bundle. We used multiple analytical approaches to report the nature of adaptations, including hybrid thematic analysis and content analysis informed by the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications - Expanded. RESULTS: Adaptations were categorized by content (intervention components), context (how the intervention is delivered, based on the study, target population, intervention format, intervention delivery mode, study setting, study personnel), training, and evaluation. Of 51 adaptations, 43.1% involved content, 41.2% involved context, and 15.7% involved training and evaluation. Several key adaptations were noted: (1) Intervention content was tailored to patient preferences and needs (e.g., rewording elements to prevent stigmatization of mental health needs; adjusting BA techniques and documentation forms to improve patient buy-in and motivation). (2) Cohort-specific adaptations were recommended based on differing patient needs. (3) Compassion was identified by patients as the most important element. CONCLUSIONS: We identified evidence-based mental health intervention components from other settings and adapted them to the perioperative setting for older adults. Informed by mixed-methods, we created an innovative and pragmatic patient-centered intervention bundle that is acceptable, feasible, and responsive to the needs of older surgical populations. This approach allowed us to identify implementation strategies to improve the reach, scalability, and sustainability of our bundle, and can guide future patient-centered intervention adaptations.

Preferences of patients with diabetes mellitus for primary healthcare institutions: a discrete choice experiment in China.,"OBJECTIVES: To quantify the preference of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) for primary healthcare (PHC) institutions in China to redirect the patient flow and improve health outcomes. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. Discrete choice experiment (DCE) surveys asked patients with DM to choose between hypothetical institutions that differed in the medical service capacity, out-of-pocket (OOP) medical costs per month, travel time, the attitude of medical staff and the availability of diabetes drugs. SETTING: Shandong province, China. PARTICIPANTS: The participants were 887 patients with DM from 36 urban communities and 36 rural villages in Shandong province. One participant did not provide any DCE answers and a further 57 patients failed the internal consistency test. 829 fully completed surveys were included in the final data analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A mixed logit model was used to calculate the willingness to pay and predict choice probabilities for PHC institution attributes. Preference heterogeneity was also investigated. RESULTS: All five attributes were associated with the preferences of patients with DM. The OOP medical costs and the medical service capacity were the most influential attributes. Improvements simultaneously in the attitude of medical staff, drug availability and travel time increased the likelihood of a patient's PHC institution choice. Preferences differed by region, annual household income and duration of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient preference data may help policymakers improve health services and increase acceptance of choosing PHC institutions. The OOP medical costs and medical service capacity should be regarded as a priority in decision-making.",1
Associations between Present-on-Admission Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders and Short-Term Outcomes in Patients with Pneumonia.,"OBJECTIVES: Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders are used to express patient preferences for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This study examined whether early DNR orders are associated with differences in treatments and outcomes among patients hospitalized with pneumonia. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 768,015 adult patients hospitalized with pneumonia from 2010 to 2015 in 646 US hospitals. The exposure was DNR orders present on admission. Secondary analyses stratified patients by predicted in-hospital mortality. Main outcomes included in-hospital mortality, length of stay, cost, intensive care admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, noninvasive ventilation, vasopressors, and dialysis initiation. RESULTS: Of 768,015 patients, 94,155 (12.3%) had an early DNR order. Compared with those without, patients with DNR orders were older (mean age 80.1 ± 10.6 years vs 67.8 ± 16.4 years), with higher comorbidity burden, intensive care use (31.6% vs 30.6%), and in-hospital mortality (28.2% vs 8.5%). After adjustment via propensity score weighting, these patients had higher mortality (odds ratio [OR] 2.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.33-2.45) and lower use of intensive therapies such as vasopressors (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.81-0.85) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.66-0.70). Although there was little relationship between predicted mortality and DNR orders, among those with highest predicted mortality, DNR orders were associated with lower intensive care use compared with those without (66.7% vs 80.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with early DNR orders have higher in-hospital mortality rates than those without, but often receive intensive care. These orders have the most impact on the care of patients with the highest mortality risk.",0
Preferences of people living with HIV for injectable and oral antiretroviral treatment in the Netherlands: a discrete choice experiment.,"ABSTRACTInjectable antiretroviral treatment (ART) represents a new effective and potentially more convenient alternative to oral ART for people living with HIV (PLWH). This study assessed preferences of PLWH for long-acting injectable compared with oral ART in the Netherlands. A labelled discrete choice experiment presented 12 choice sets of long-acting injectable and oral ART. PLWH were asked to select their preferred ART, described by six attributes: location of administration, dosing frequency, risk of short-term side effects, drug-drug interaction, forgivability, and food and mealtime restrictions. Random parameters logit and latent class models were used to estimate preferences of PLWH. 98.6% of 76 respondents were experienced oral ART users that had taken ART for a median of 12 years (Q1-Q3: 7.0-20.0). 30 (39.5%) respondents chose long-acting injectable ART in all choice tasks and 22 (28.9%) always chose oral ART. The random parameter model showed that, on average, respondents significantly favoured long-acting injectable ART over oral ART, preferred administration of the long-acting injectable ART at home, and a less frequent regimen. The latent class model confirmed one class strongly preferring long-acting injectable ART and one class slightly preferring oral ART. This study highlights the value for both long-acting injectable and oral ART.",1
"Patients' and Clinicians' Experiences with In-person, Video, and Phone Modalities for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment: A Qualitative Study.","BACKGROUND: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic condition that requires regular visits and care continuity. Telehealth implementation has created multiple visit modalities for OUD care. There is limited knowledge of patients' and clinicians' perceptions and experiences related to multi-modality care and when different modalities might be best employed. OBJECTIVE: To identify patients' and clinicians' experiences with multiple visit modalities for OUD treatment in primary care. DESIGN: Comparative case study, using video- and telephone-based semi-structured interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Patients being treated for OUD (n = 19) and clinicians who provided OUD care (n = 15) from two primary care clinics within the same healthcare system. APPROACH: Using an inductive approach, interviews were analyzed to identify patients' and clinicians' experiences with receiving/delivering OUD care via different visit modalities. Clinicians' and patients' experiences were compared using a group analytical process. KEY RESULTS: Patients and clinicians valued having multiple modalities available for care, with flexibility identified as a key benefit. Patients highlighted the decreased burden of travel and less social anxiety with telehealth visits. Similarly, clinicians reported that telehealth decreased medical intrusion into the lives of patients stable in recovery. Patients and clinicians saw the value of in-person visits when establishing care and for patients needing additional support. In-person visits allowed the ability to conduct urine drug testing, and to foster relationships and trust building, which were more difficult, but not impossible via a telehealth visit. Patients preferred telephone over video visits, as these were more private and more convenient. Clinicians identified benefits of video, including being able to both hear and see the patient, but often deferred to patient preference. CONCLUSIONS: Considerations for utilization of visit modalities for OUD care were identified based on patients' needs and preferences, which often changed over the course of treatment. Continued research is needed determine how visit modalities impact patient outcomes.",0
Chaplain reported plans for end-of-life care conversations: Role clarity for the spiritual care specialists.,"The present study examined chaplain reported plans for patient conversations regarding end-of-life (EOL) care through the lens of multiple goals. Chaplains (n = 69) were asked to curate a plan for engaging with a patient about EOL treatment options, including how they would engage in the conversation and what they would plan to discuss. Findings indicated that plans primarily consisted of relational and identity goals, with a majority navigating multiple goal orientations. Content overwhelmingly involved developing rapport with patients, eliciting patient preferences for care, and serving as a patient liaison. The current study addresses the paucity of research around the role a chaplain plays on the interdisciplinary team and their respective approach to EOL conversations. Examination of curated plans affords insight to what content is prioritized and which conversational goals are present. Integration of multiple goals offers preliminary evidence for conversational quality. Awareness of goal approach and content prioritized affords clarity on how chaplains can be called upon to support members of the interdisciplinary care team.",0
Pharmacological and Non-pharmacological Approaches for the Management of Neuropathic Pain in Multiple Sclerosis.,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the central nervous system and can cause various types of pain including ongoing extremity pain, Lhermitte's phenomenon, trigeminal neuralgia, and mixed pain. Neuropathic pain is a major concern for individuals with multiple sclerosis as it is directly linked to myelin damage in the central nervous system and the management of neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis is challenging as the options available have limited efficacy and can cause unpleasant side effects. The literature search was conducted across two databases, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Eligible studies included clinical trials, observational studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and narrative reviews. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of literature on pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies employed in the management of neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis. Pharmacological options include cannabinoids, muscle relaxants (tizanidine, baclofen, dantrolene), anticonvulsants (benzodiazepines, gabapentin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine), antidepressants (duloxetine, venlafaxine, tricyclic antidepressants), opioids (naltrexone), and botulinum toxin variants, which have evidence from various clinical trials. Non-pharmacological approaches for trigeminal neuralgia may include neurosurgical methods. Non-invasive methods, physical therapy, and psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction) may be recommended for patients with neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis. The choice of treatment depends on the severity and type of pain as well as other factors, such as patient preferences and comorbidities. There is a pressing need for healthcare professionals and researchers to prioritize the development of better strategies for managing multiple sclerosis-induced neuropathic pain.",0
"Development of a Specific Variant of Patient Benefit Index (PBI) Assessing Patient Needs, Goals and Benefits in Rosacea Treatment.","INTRODUCTION: Evaluation of patient-reported outcomes including health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and perceived benefits from treatment has become a fundamental component of medical decision-making. Standardized evaluation of treatment benefits in rosacea based on patient preferences is still lacking. OBJECTIVE: Development and validation of an instrument for recording patient-defined benefits in rosacea therapy based on the Patient Benefit Index (PBI) methodology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an open survey of n = 50 patients, potential benefits of therapy from the patient's perspective were examined. The generated item pool was combined with pre-existing PBI items for other skin conditions and reviewed by an expert panel of dermatologists, psychologists and patients. Items were condensed to n = 25 and converted into a Likert-scaled questionnaire. The validity and feasibility of the resulting Patient Benefit Index for rosacea (PBI-RO) were tested on individuals with rosacea recruited from a German rosacea patient organization. RESULTS: N = 446 patients with rosacea completed the PBI-RO. The internal consistencies measured by Cronbach's alpha were high (Patient Needs Questionnaire [PNQ] 0.94). Mean PBI-RO was 1.9 ± 1.2 (scale from 0 = no benefit to 4 = maximum benefit), 23.5% of the patients experienced a PBI-RO < 1 (no clinically relevant benefit). The PBI-RO correlated with HRQoL, health state, current extent of rosacea lesions and treatment satisfaction. The highest correlation was found between PBI-RO and satisfaction with previous treatment (r = -0.59, p < 0.001); correlation with the extent of rosacea lesions was low (r = 0.16, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The PBI-RO shows satisfying internal consistency and construct validity. It offers the option of a patient-weighted evaluation of the therapeutic benefit of rosacea therapy and may add to more stringent goal orientation in therapy.",0
Is there a role for biomarkers in asymptomatic severe chronic primary mitral regurgitation?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Chronic primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common heart valve disease with a rising prevalence with the aging populations worldwide. The timing of surgical intervention in patients who have severe MR but remain asymptomatic is often debated. Herein we synthesize the latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and European Society of Cardiology/ European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (ESC/EACTS) heart valve guidelines in such patients and illustrate how circulating and/or imaging biomarkers can be used to help refine decision making algorithms. RECENT FINDINGS: The approach to decision making and strength of guideline recommendations in patients with asymptomatic stage C1 (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] > 60% and left ventricular end systolic dimension [LVESD] < 40 mm) and stage C2 disease (LVEF ≤ 60% and/or LVESD ≥ 40 mm) are reviewed. While surgical intervention is clearly indicated in patients with stage C2 disease, a multifaceted approach that integrates repairability, expertise, sub-clinical evidence of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and patient preferences is required to identify the optimal approach to surveillance vs. surgery. The role of imaging (3D echocardiography, contrast echocardiography, left ventricular global longitudinal strain, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging [CMR]) and circulating (natriuretic peptides) biomarkers in decision making is also reviewed. SUMMARY: The decision making around timing of intervention in chronic primary MR requires a personalized approach that is based on accurate assessments of severity of MR, LV dimensions, LV function, valve morphology/repairability, surgeon and center expertise, and patient wishes. Biomarkers hold promise in refining decision making.",0
"Short-term anti-TNF therapy with surgical closure versus anti-TNF therapy alone for Crohn's perianal fistulas (PISA-II): long-term outcomes of an international, multicentre patient preference, randomised controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: The PISA-II trial showed that short-term anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy followed by surgical closure induces radiological healing of perianal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease more frequently than anti-TNF therapy alone after 18 months. This study aimed to compare long-term outcomes of both treatment arms. METHODS: Follow-up data were collected from patients who participated in the PISA-II trial, an international patient preference randomised controlled trial. This multicentre trial was performed in nine hospitals in the Netherlands and one hospital in Italy. Patients with Crohn's disease above the age of 18 years with an active high perianal fistula and a single internal opening were asked to participate. Patients were allocated to anti-TNF therapy (intravenous infliximab, or subcutaneous adalimumab, at the discretion of the gastroenterologist) for one year, or surgical closure combined with 4-months anti-TNF therapy. Patients without a treatment preference were randomised (1:1) using random block randomisation (block sizes of six without stratification), and patients with a treatment preference were treated according to their preferred treatment arm. For the current follow-up study, data were collected until May 2022. Primary outcome was radiological healing on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including all participants with a MRI made less than 6 months ago at the time of data collection. Analysis was based on observed data. FINDINGS: Between September 14, 2013, and December 7, 2019, 94 patients were enrolled in the trial. Long-term follow-up data were available in 91 patients (36/38 (95%) anti-TNF + surgical closure, 55/56 (98%) anti-TNF). A total of 14/36 (39%) patients in the surgical closure arm were randomly assigned, which was not significantly different in the anti-TNF treatment arm (16/55 (29%) randomly assigned). Median follow-up was 5.7 years (interquartile range (IQR) 5-7). Radiological healing occurred significantly more often after anti-TNF + surgical closure (15/36 = 42% versus 10/55 = 18%; P = 0.014). Clinical closure was comparable (26/36 = 72% versus 34/55 = 62%; P = 0.18) in both groups. However, clinical closure in the surgical group was achieved with less re-interventions 4/26 (= 15%) versus 18/34 (= 53%), including (redo-)surgical closure procedures. Recurrences occurred in 0/25 (0%) patients with radiological healing versus 27/76 (36%) patients with clinical closure, sometime during follow-up. Anti-TNF trough levels were higher in patients with long-term clinical closure in both groups (P = 0.031 and P = 0.014). In 6/11 (55%) patients in the anti-TNF group with available trough levels, recurrences were diagnosed within three months of a drop under 3.5ug/ml. 36 patients stopped anti-TNF, after which 0/14 (0%) patients with radiological healing developed a recurrence and 9/22 (41%) with clinical closure. Self-rated (in)continence was comparable between groups, and 79% (60/76) of patients indicated comparable/improved continence after treatment. Decision-regret analysis showed that all (30/30) anti-TNF + surgical closure patients agreed or strongly agreed that surgery was the right decision versus 78% (36/46) in the anti-TNF arm. All surgical closure patients would go for the same treatment again, whereas this was 89% (41/46) in the anti-TNF arm. INTERPRETATION: This study confirmed that surgical closure should be considered in amenable patients with perianal fistulas and Crohn's disease as long-term outcomes were favourable, and that radiological healing should be the aim of treatment as recurrences only occurred in patients without radiological healing. In patients with complete MRI closure, anti-TNF could be safely stopped. FUNDING: None.",0
No obvious effect on mortality from a patient choice reform expanding access to opioid disorder treatment - results from a natural experiment of policy change in Sweden.,"BACKGROUND: Opioid-related overdose deaths remain a common cause of death in many settings, and opioid maintenance treatment is evidence-based for the treatment of opioid use disorders. However, access to such treatment varies and is limited in many settings. METHODS: The present study examines the longitudinal effects of a regional patient choice reform which substantially increased availability to opioid maintenance treatment in one Swedish county, starting from 2014. A previous follow-up, limited in time, indicated a possible effect on mortality from this intervention, demonstrating a lower increase in overdose deaths than in counties without this reform. The present study follows overdose deaths through 2021, and compares the intervention county to the remaining parts in the country, using death certificate statistics from the national causes of death register. RESULTS: The present study does not demonstrate any significant difference in the development of overdose mortality in the county where this reform substantially expanded treatment access, compared to other counties in the country. CONCLUSIONS: The study underlines the importance to maintain extensive efforts against overdose deaths over and above the treatment of opioid use disorders, such as low-threshold provision of opioid antidotes or other interventions specifically addressing overdose risk behaviors.",0
Practice patterns in management of differentiated thyroid cancer since the 2014 British Thyroid Association (BTA) guidelines.,"BACKGROUND: The updated 2014 BTA guidelines emphasised a more conservative, risk adapted model for the management of low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). In comparison to historical approach of total thyroidectomy combined with radioactive iodine, treatment de-escalation is increasingly supported. AIMS: To evaluate the impact of the updated BTA guidelines on the management of DTC cases at regional UK centre. METHODS: All DTC patients were retrospectively identified from regional thyroid MDT database between Jan2009-Dec2020. Oncological treatment and clinico-pathological characteristics were analysed. RESULTS: 623 DTC cases were identified; 312 (247 female: 65 male) between 2009 and 2014 and 311 (225 female: 86 male) between 2015 and 2020. Median age is 48 years (range 16-85). By comparing pre- and post-2015 cohorts, there was a significant drop in total thyroidectomy (87.1% vs 76.8%, p = 0.001) and the use of radioactive iodine (RAI) (73.1% vs 62.1%, p = 0.003) in our post-2015 cohort. When histological adverse features were analysed, extra-thyroidal extension (4.2% vs 17.0%, p=< 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (31.4% vs 50.5%, p=<0.001) and multi-centricity (26.9% vs 43.4%, p = 0.001) were significantly increased in the post 2015 cohort. Nonetheless, total thyroidectomy (TT) remains the treatment choice for low risk T1/2 N0 M0 disease in 65.3% (124/190) in post-2015 cohort for several reasons. Reasons include adverse histological features (50.8%), benign indications (32.5%), contralateral nodules (11.7%), patient preference (2.5%), and diagnostic uncertainty (2.5%). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms a move towards a more conservative approach to patients with low-risk DTC in the UK, which is in keeping with the BTA 2014 guideline and international trends, but total thyroidectomy remains prevalent for low risk T1/2 N0 M0 disease for other reasons.",0
"A cross-sectional study on factors influencing patient participation in undergraduate medical education in a public and private hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa.","BACKGROUND: The active involvement of patients in medical education is a common practice globally. Despite this, there is a global paucity of data on patients' views on their role in medical education. As such this study aimed to identify factors that influence patient participation in undergraduate medical education in public and private hospitals in Johannesburg. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted, using a 23-question, self-designed, paper questionnaire to collect data on patients' perceptions of student involvement in their care - with regard to consent, confidentiality, ethics, and patient preferences. Participants were recruited on a voluntary basis in the Departments of Medicine, Surgery, and Gynaecology, at selected hospital sites. Fisher's Exact and Chi-Square statistical tests were used where appropriate. RESULTS: Two hundred and one adult patients, comprised of 150 public sector patients and 51 private sector patients, completed the questionnaire. One hundred and sixty-nine patients (84,1%) were willing to participate in undergraduate medical education and no notable difference between these sectors was demonstrated (p = 0,41). The results further demonstrated that the main factors influencing patient participation in undergraduate medical education across both sectors were (1) the presence of a supervising professional, (2) the perceived degree of invasiveness of a procedure, and (3) the perceived expertise of the student. In addition, data across other key themes such as consent, confidentiality, ethics, and patient preferences and perceptions were elucidated. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the majority of inpatients across the public and private sectors are willing to participate in undergraduate medical education to facilitate the development of healthcare professionals. It also demonstrated that most patients have a positive experience. However, more measures of quality informed consent need to be instituted to optimise the current role of the South African public health sector, whilst facilitating the development of a similar role for the South African private sector in future clinical education. In addition, further research is necessary to evaluate these findings in a South African context.",0
Exercise Preferences in Young Adults with Cancer-The YOUEX Study.,"(1) Background: Strong evidence supports the persuasive positive effects of exercise for cancer patients and survivors. Different approaches of exercise programs have been established; however, the special interests of young adults (YAs) with cancer have rarely been considered in exercise interventions. Therefore, the study YOUng EXercisers (YOUEX) aimed to investigate exercise preferences in YAs. (2) Methods: YOUEX was a three-arm, patient preference-based non-randomized, longitudinal, pre-post exercise intervention, offering three different exercise modules to YAs during or after acute therapy (Module 1: online supervised group-based (M1); Module 2: online unsupervised (M2); Module 3: in-person supervised (M3)). The intervention period was 12 weeks with another 12-week follow-up period, the modules could be changed or amended after 6 and 12 weeks. (3) Results: 92 YAs were allocated to the study. At baseline, 50 YAs (54%) chose M2, 32 YAs (35%) M1 and 10 YAs (11%) M3. The analysis revealed high acceptability and feasibility of the online exercise programs (M1, M2). There was a high impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the execution of M3. YAs showed diverse preferences in module selection due to differences in, e.g., cancer therapy status or favored level of supervision. (4) Conclusions: YAs need personalized exercise programs that consider their individual interests and needs. Online exercise programs can be a promising addition to existing exercise opportunities. They are an effective way to increase physical activity levels in YAs.",0
Differences between physician and patient preferences for cancer treatments: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making is useful to facilitate cancer treatment decisions. However, it is difficult to make treatment decisions when physician and patient preferences are different. This review aimed to summarize and compare the preferences for cancer treatments between physicians and patients. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Scopus. Studies elicited and compared preferences for cancer treatments between physicians and patients were included. Information about the study design and preference measuring attributes or questions were extracted. The available relative rank of every attribute in discrete choice experiment (DCE) studies and answers to preference measuring questions in non-DCE studies were summarized followed by a narrative synthesis to reflect the preference differences. RESULTS: Of 12,959 studies identified, 8290 were included in the title and abstract screening and 48 were included in the full text screening. Included 37 studies measured the preferences from six treatment-related aspects: health benefit, adverse effects, treatment process, cost, impact on quality of life, and provider qualification. The trade-off between health benefit and adverse effects was the main focus of the included studies. DCE studies showed patients gave a higher rank on health benefit and treatment process, while physicians gave a higher rank on adverse effects. Non-DCE studies suggested that patients were willing to take a higher risk of adverse effects or lower health benefit than physicians when accepting a treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians and patients had important preference differences for cancer treatment. More sufficient communication is needed in cancer treatment decision-making.",1

Exploring Patient Adherence to Post-Surgical Follow-Up in Pelvic Endometriosis.,"Endometriosis is a significant cause of disability that affects 5-10% of reproductive-aged women. Laparoscopy with histological confirmation is the gold standard in establishing the diagnosis as therapeutic management surgery is addressed to a certain category of patients. The objective of this study was to assess patient adherence to follow-up after surgery for endometriosis as the primary endpoint, pain symptoms, quality of life, mental health, and fertility as the secondary endpoints. We have analyzed patients' adherence to follow-up after surgery for endometriosis after 1, 3, 5, and 7 years. Out of the 2538 total number of surgeries, 453 patients replied just to the first questionnaire (group A), 528 to the first and second (group B), and only 356 carried out the entire follow-up schedule. General health was significantly lower for group A (46.6 vs. 56.4) but with no statistical difference in the post-surgical improvement in both groups. Pain level score improvement was lower for group A (10.5 vs. 18.8), which is statistically significant. In this light, laparoscopy still remains the gold standard in diagnosis only. Furthermore, no malignancy was discovered. The mental component was improved by laparoscopy based on SF-36 in group B. Studies on patient preference for surgery versus alternative treatment are needed.",0
Adherence to evidence-based implementation of antimicrobial treatment guidelines among prescribers in sub-Saharan Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Adherence to evidence-based standard treatment guidelines (STGs) enable healthcare providers to deliver consistently appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Irrational use of antimicrobials significantly contributes to antimicrobial resistance in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).  The best available evidence is needed to guide healthcare providers on adherence to evidence-based implementation of STGs. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of adherence to evidence-based implementation of antimicrobial treatment guidelines among prescribers in SSA. METHODS: The review followed the JBI methodology for systematic reviews of prevalence data. CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched with no language and publication year limitations. STATA version 17 were used for meta-analysis. The publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed using Egger's test and the I(2) statistics. Heterogeneity and publication bias were validated using Duval and Tweedie's nonparametric trim and fill analysis using the random-effect analysis. The summary prevalence and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of healthcare professionals' compliance with evidence-based implementation of STG were estimated using random effect model. The review protocol has been registered with PROSPERO code CRD42023389011. The PRISMA flow diagram and checklist were used to report studies included, excluded and their corresponding section in the manuscript. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies with a total of 17,017 study participants from 14 countries in sub-Saharan Africa were included. The pooled prevalence of adherence to evidence-based implementation of antimicrobial treatment guidelines in SSA were 45%. The pooled prevalence of the most common clinical indications were respiratory tract (35%) and gastrointestinal infections (18%). Overall prescriptions per wards were inpatients (14,413) and outpatients (12,845). Only 391 prescribers accessed standard treatment guidelines during prescription of antimicrobials. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals' adherence to evidence-based implementation of STG for antimicrobial treatment were low in SSA. Healthcare systems in SSA must make concerted efforts to enhance prescribers access to STGs through optimization of mobile clinical decision support applications. Innovative, informative, and interactive strategies must be in place by the healthcare systems in SSA to empower healthcare providers to make evidence-based clinical decisions informed by the best available evidence and patient preferences, to ultimately improving patient outcomes and promoting appropriate antimicrobial use.",0
Treatment patterns and outcomes among adults with immune thrombocytopenia receiving pharmaceutical second-line therapies: a retrospective cohort study using administrative claims data.,"OBJECTIVES: To describe and compare real-world treatment patterns and clinical outcomes among individuals with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) receiving second-line therapies (rituximab, romiplostim, or eltrombopag). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a large administrative claims database (January 2013-May 2020) among continuously enrolled patients ≥18 years prescribed second-line ITP therapies. The index date was the date of the first claim of the study medications. Treatment patterns and outcomes were measured during the 12-month follow-up period. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to balance covariates across treatment groups. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare treatment patterns and bleeding risk outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 695 patients were included (rituximab, N = 285; romiplostim, N = 212; eltrombopag, N = 198). After IPTW, all baseline covariates were balanced. Compared to eltrombopag, patients in the rituximab cohort were 57% more likely to receive other ITP therapies (systematic corticosteroids or third-line therapies) during the follow-up period (odds ratio [OR] = 1.571, p = .030). There was no significant difference in the odds of receiving a different second-line therapy or experiencing a bleeding-related episode among three groups (p > .050). Patients in the romiplostim cohort were 69% more likely to receive rescue therapy compared to those in the rituximab cohort (OR = 1.688, p = .025). CONCLUSION: Patients with ITP receiving rituximab were more likely to need other ITP therapies but did not experience higher risk of bleeding compared to those receiving eltrombopag or romiplostim. Benefits, risks, cost-effectiveness, and patient preference should all be considered in optimizing second-line therapy for ITP.",0
QALY-type preference and willingness-to-pay among end-of-life patients with cancer treatments: a pilot study using discrete choice experiment.,"PURPOSE: Quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is a dominant measurement of health gain in economic evaluations for pricing drugs. However, end-of-life (EoL) patients' preference for QALY gains in life expectancy (LE) and quality of life (QoL) during different disease stages remains unknown and is seldom involved in decision-making. This study aims to measure preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) towards different types of QALY gain among EoL cancer patients. METHODS: We attributed QALY gain to four types, gain in LE and QoL, respectively, and during both progression-free survival (PFS) and post-progression survival (PPS). A discrete choice experiment including five attributes (the four QALY attributes and one cost attribute) with three levels each was developed and conducted with 85 Chinese advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients in 2022. All levels were set with QALY gain/cost synthesised from research on anti-lung cancer drugs recently listed by Chinese National Healthcare Security Administration. Each respondent answered six choice tasks in a face-to-face interview. The data were analysed using mixed logit models. RESULTS: Patients valued LE-related QALY gain in PFS most, with a relative importance of 81.8% and a WTP of $43,160 [95% CI 26,751 ~ 59,569] per QALY gain. Respondents consistently preferred LE-related to QoL-related QALY gain regardless of disease stage. Patients with higher income or lower education levels tended to pay more for QoL-related QALY gain. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a prioritised resource allocation to EoL-prolonging health technologies. Given the small sample size and large individual heterogeneity, a full-scale study is needed to provide more robust results.",1
MK-0616: an oral PCSK9 inhibitor for hypercholesterolemia treatment.,"INTRODUCTION: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lowering LDL-cholesterol, by lifestyle modification or therapeutically, reduces the risk of ASCVD. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a protein which binds to the LDL-receptor and induces degradation, is a clinically validated target to lower LDL-cholesterol. Injectable PCSK9 inhibitor therapies have demonstrated substantial reductions in LDL-cholesterol with associated decreased risk of ASCVD events. AREAS COVERED: MK-0616 is an orally bioavailable, renally excreted, macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of PCSK9. The article provides an understanding of the chemistry and development, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of MK-0616 and insight into its clinical efficacy and safety. In clinical trials, MK-0616 produced dose-dependent reductions in LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein (apo) B levels. Furthermore, MK-0616 modestly lowered lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)]. EXPERT OPINION: MK-0616 is a potent, oral macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of PCSK9 that is not only able to reduce LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol, and apoB, but can also lower Lp(a). Safety and tolerability studies reported to date are promising. MK-0616 may offer advantages over injectable anti-PCSK9 therapies in terms of ease of dosing, patient preference and cost. The results from phase III trials of MK-0616 on cardiovascular outcomes are awaited with interest.",0
Characteristics of international primary care practices and physicians related to advance care planning: a cross-sectional survey study.,"BACKGROUND: Primary care providers (PCPs) are well-situated to delivery primary palliative care such as advance care planning (ACP). The aim of this work is to identify practice characteristics, including features found in advanced primary care models (APCMs), that predict PCP engagement of patients in ACP. METHODS: We analyzed characteristics of physician respondents and their practices associated with ACP conversations in older and sicker patients using data from 11 countries who participated in the 2015 Commonwealth Fund International Survey of Primary Care Physicians in 10 Nations. The primary outcome was how routinely these ACP conversations are reported. We used a validated measure to describe practice-level characteristics of advanced primary care models. We conducted bivariate and multivariable analyses to determine PCP and practice characteristics associated with routinely engaging patients in ACP and with documenting patient preferences in medical records. RESULTS: Respondents (N = 12,049) predominantly were older than 45 and did not view their jobs as high stress. PCPs reported routinely engaging patients in ACP work in practices with more APCM features. They are more likely to view their jobs as high stress, to work more hours, to practice in rural areas, and to work in smaller practices. Multivariable analyses showed that older PCP age, higher perceived stress of the job, practice location in rural areas, and increased number of APCM features were associated with more ACP conversations. Increased number of APCM features was also associated with higher odds of routinely recording patient preferences in their medical records. CONCLUSIONS: In this international survey, physician and practice characteristics, including having features associated with APCMs, were associated with whether physicians routinely discuss ACP with patients who are older and sicker. Many features of APCMs may facilitate ACP discussions between PCPs and patients.",0
Long-term outcomes after plaque excision grafting for Peyronie's disease and subanalysis of patients who undergo the procedure despite preoperative counseling against it.,"BACKGROUND: Plaque excision and grafting (PEG) has been recommended for patients with Peyronie's disease (PD) with >60° curvature and/or hinge effect and strong preoperative erections, while placement of an inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) is recommended when rigidity is suboptimal. Nevertheless, many patients counseled to undergo an IPP decline and insist on proceeding with PEG due to personal preference or desire to avoid an implant. AIM: We aim to review long-term outcomes in patients who underwent PEG for PD at our institution and investigate whether there is any difference in long-term outcomes in patients who undergo PEG despite a recommendation to undergo IPP. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review from 2007 to 2021 on PEG surgery performed at a single tertiary care institution in patients ≥18 years old who had >3 months of follow-up. OUTCOMES: Postoperative information was gathered from the electronic medical record, including postoperative erectile function, patient satisfaction, and the ability to engage in penetrative sexual intercourse. RESULTS: An overall 251 patients underwent PEG with a median follow-up of 12 months (IQR, 6-54). Among these, 54 (22%) were initially advised to undergo IPP but elected for PEG. Patients who underwent PEG despite counseling to undergo IPP reported lower postoperative ability to engage in intercourse (51% vs 76%). Seven (13%) patients initially advised to undergo IPP eventually received an IPP, relative to 7 (4%) initially advised to undergo PEG. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Thorough preoperative assessment of erectile function and penile deformity can guide clinician counseling and manage patient expectations during decision making between PEG surgery and IPP implantation for PD. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature, high attrition to follow-up, and risk of recall and selection bias. This is a large study with a median follow-up of 12 months, with a high-volume single surgeon who treats patients in a specialized population of complex cases. CONCLUSION: Patients who were initially counseled to undergo IPP due to suboptimal erectile rigidity but elected for PEG had worse postoperative ability to engage in penetrative intercourse, and a higher proportion of these patients eventually received an IPP.",0
Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of active Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy in persons with diabetes mellitus (IWGDF 2023).,"The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence-based guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease since 1999. This is the first guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of active Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy in persons with diabetes published by the IWGDF. We followed the GRADE Methodology to devise clinical questions in the PACO (Population, Assessment, Comparison, Outcome) and PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) format, conducted a systematic review of the medical literature, and developed recommendations with the rationale. The recommendations are based on the evidence from our systematic review, expert opinion when evidence was not available, and also taking into account weighing of the benefits and harms, patient preferences, feasibility and applicability, and costs related to an intervention. We here present the 2023 Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of active Charcot neuro-osteoarthropathy in persons with diabetes mellitus and also suggest key future topics of research.",0
Rapid implementation of remote digital primary care in Stockholm and implications for further system-wide implementation: practitioner's and manager's experience of the Always Open mobile application.,"OBJECTIVE: To contribute actionable knowledge how to increase appropriate use of digital technologies in primary care by understanding clinical managers experiences with a digital connection system, Always Open, during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: The overall design was a qualitative study with directed content analysis method. Data were collected from documents and focus group (n = 12) interviews with clinical managers (n = 99) of primary care. The seven domains of the Non-adoption, Abandonment, and challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) framework was used to understand the implementation process, as described by the clinical managers. RESULTS: Focus group participants reported that their units made their own local decisions to make more use of the technology provided by the health system. Most participants considered that the technology was ready to use, despite some limitations, that included individual clinician's and patient preferences, and how ready their unit was for making changes to practice and organization. Some raised concerns about how standardizing some aspects possibly conflicted with the decentralized management model of the organization. The overall experience was reported to be positive, with an intention to sustain the achievements. CONCLUSION: Focus group interviews found that clinical unit managers reported that they and their staff were positive about the digital technology system for remote care. For the future, they wanted changes to be made at different levels of the health system to better combine digital and physical care. Possibilities to use digital technology to integrate primary and hospital health care were identified.",0
Advance Care Planning in Serious Illness: A Narrative Review.,"CONTEXT: Advance care planning (ACP) intends to support person-centered medical decision-making by eliciting patient preferences. Research has not identified significant associations between ACP and goal-concordant end-of-life care, leading to justified scientific debate regarding ACP utility. OBJECTIVE: To delineate ACP's potential benefits and missed opportunities and identify an evidence-informed, clinically relevant path ahead for ACP in serious illness. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review merging the best available ACP empirical data, grey literature, and emergent scholarly discourse using a snowball search of PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar (2000-2022). Findings were informed by our team's interprofessional clinical and research expertise in serious illness care. RESULTS: Early ACP practices were largely tied to mandated document completion, potentially failing to capture the holistic preferences of patients and surrogates. ACP models focused on serious illness communication rather than documentation show promising patient and clinician results. Ideally, ACP would lead to goal-concordant care even amid the unpredictability of serious illness trajectories. But ACP might also provide a false sense of security that patients' wishes will be honored and revisited at end-of-life. An iterative, 'building block' framework to integrate ACP throughout serious illness is provided alongside clinical practice, research, and policy recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: We advocate a balanced approach to ACP, recognizing empirical deficits while acknowledging potential benefits and ethical imperatives (e.g., fostering clinician-patient trust and shared decision-making). We support prioritizing patient/surrogate-centered outcomes with more robust measures to account for interpersonal clinician-patient variables that likely inform ACP efficacy and may better evaluate information gleaned during serious illness encounters.",0
Informed Decision Making for Anticoagulation Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) must decide between warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), a decision involving important tradeoffs. Our objective was to understand whether physicians engage patients in informed decision making for anticoagulants. DESIGN: We performed an analysis of recorded conversations between physicians and anticoagulation-naïve patients in the Verilogue Point-of-Practice database. We assessed the presence of 7 elements of informed decision making, as well as a discussion of financial costs. RESULTS: Of 37 encounters with 21 physicians, 92% resulted in a DOAC prescription and 8% resulted in a warfarin prescription. Seventy percent met criteria for discussion of pros and cons, 70% for discussion of the alternatives, 43% presented the decision, 30% included an assessment of patient understanding, 22% included an explanation of the patient's role in decision making, 22% included an assessment of patient preferences, and 19% included a discussion of uncertainty. Two encounters (5%) included all 7 elements and 9 (24%) included none. Physicians discussed treatment costs with patients in 43% of encounters. LIMITATIONS: We assessed informed decision making in a single encounter. Physicians and patients may have had other discussions that were not captured in our data. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians often presented the alternatives but did not generally engage patients in informed decision making. The high rate of DOAC prescriptions is likely the result of physician preferences, as patient preferences were rarely assessed. IMPLICATIONS: Strategies to support physicians in engaging patients in informed decision making for anticoagulation are needed. HIGHLIGHTS: While physicians discussed the alternatives and presented pros and cons with patients, they rarely assessed patient preferences, explained the patient's role in decision making, or addressed uncertainty.The cost of treatment with DOACs versus warfarin was discussed by physicians in less than half of encounters, limiting patients' ability to make informed decisions for anticoagulation.Only 2 encounters (5%) fulfilled all 7 elements of informed decision making.",0
Nurses' perception of the hospitals' culture and readiness of evidence-based practise integration in the hospital's system in western Ethiopia.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based practise is a method by which healthcare professionals integrate the best available evidence, individual expertise and patient preferences to improve patient safety and utilise quality healthcare. No study was conducted in Ethiopia to assess the nurses' perception of the hospitals' culture and readiness for evidence-based practice integration into the hospital's system. Hence, this study aimed to assess the perception of nurses on the hospitals' culture and readiness of evidence-based practise integration in hospitals' systems in Western Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving 412 nurses in six hospitals in western Ethiopia was conducted between December 2022 and February 2023. A 25-item Organisational Culture and Readiness of System-Wide Integration of EBP scale was used, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.94. While 25 is the minimum score, 125 is the maximum; higher scores indicate better hospital culture and readiness for system-wide integration of evidence-based practice. A self-administered data collection technique was used. Descriptive statistics were computed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 25 software. RESULTS: Four hundred and twelve nurses participated in the study. The majority (85.9%) were bachelor's degree holders and over a third (34.7%) worked in primary hospitals. Only a quarter (26.5%) had ever received mentorship from their leader on implementing evidence-based practice. The overall hospital culture and readiness score for system-wide integration of evidence-based practice among nurses in six hospitals was 70.3 ± 17.3. CONCLUSION: The nurses' perception of the hospitals' culture and readiness score for system-wide integration of evidence-based practice in six hospitals in Western Ethiopia was equivocal. There is a need to engage all resources and increase leadership commitment to make evidence-based practice a hospital culture. Further research is warranted to understand the national hospitals' status in establishing and sustaining evidence-based practise culture.",0
Preferences of Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis for Intrathecal Drug Delivery: Choosing between an Implanted Drug-Delivery Device and Therapeutic Lumbar Puncture.,"BACKGROUND: Novel intrathecal treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may require delivery using lumbar puncture (LP). Implanted drug-delivery devices (IDDDs) could be an alternative but little is known about patients' preferences for intrathecal drug-delivery methods. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to elicit preferences of patients with ALS for routine LP and IDDD use. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) and a threshold technique (TT) exercise were conducted online among patients with ALS in the US and Europe. In the DCE, patients made trade-offs between administration attributes. Attributes were identified from qualitative interviews. The TT elicited maximum acceptable risks (MARs) of complications from device implantation surgery. DCE data were analyzed using mixed logit to quantify relative attribute importance (RAI) as the maximum contribution of each attribute to a preference, and to estimate MARs of device failure. TT data were analyzed using interval regression. Four scenarios of LP and IDDD were compared. RESULTS: Participants (N = 295) had a mean age of 57.7 years; most (74.2%) were diagnosed < 3 years ago. Preferences were affected by device failure risk (RAI 28.6%), administration frequency (26.4%), administration risk (19.7%), overall duration (17.8%), and appointment location (7.5%). Patients accepted a 5.6% device failure risk to reduce overall duration from 2 h to 30 min and a 3.6% risk for administration in a local clinic instead of a hospital. The average MAR of complications from implantation surgery was 29%. Patients preferred IDDD over LP in three of four scenarios. CONCLUSION: Patients considered an IDDD as a valuable alternative to LP in multiple clinical settings.",1
Evaluation of post-operative surveillance strategies and surgeon perceptions and beliefs of surveillance for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in the UK.,"BACKGROUND: Despite high rates of recurrence after surgery for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) there is lack of standardised surveillance practices. We aimed to identify UK surveillance practice and interrogate surgeon beliefs around surveillance. METHODS: A web-based survey was sent to all UK pancreatic units to assess surveillance practice for resected PDAC, factors influencing surveillance protocols, and perceptions and beliefs surrounding on current postoperative surveillance. RESULTS: There was wide variation in reported practice between 40 consultant surgeons from 28 pancreatic units (100% unit response rate). 26% had standardised surveillance compared to 18% with no standardised practice. 16% individualised surveillance to the patient, and 40% reported differing practices between surgeons within units despite local surveillance protocols. 66% felt surveillance should be tailored to patient factors, and 58% to patient preference. There was a broad belief regarding a lack of robust evidence supporting surveillance making a trial necessary. Thematic analysis identified surveillance barriers, considerations for trial design, necessity for patient engagement and potential benefits of surveillance. DISCUSSION: Wide variation in surveillance practice exists within and between units. A surveillance trial was deemed beneficial, however identified barriers potentially preclude a trial. Future work should assess acceptability for patients including impact on anxiety and quality-of-life.",0
Rural patient and provider perceptions of telehealth implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding perceptions of telehealth  implementation from patients and providers can improve the utility and sustainability of these programs, particularly in under-resourced rural settings. The purpose of this study was to evaluate both patient and provider perceptions of telehealth visits in a large rural healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic. To promote sustainability of telehealth approaches, we also assessed whether the percentage of missed appointments differed between in-person and telehealth visits. METHODS: Using anonymous surveys, we evaluated patient preferences and satisfaction with telehealth visits from November 2020 -March 2021 and assessed perceptions of telehealth efficiency and value among rural providers from September-October 2020. We examined whether telehealth perceptions differed according to patients' age, educational attainment, insurance status, and distance to clinical site and providers' age and length of time practicing medicine using ANOVA test. We also examined whether the percentage of missed appointments differed between in-person and telehealth visits at a family practice clinic within the rural healthcare system from April to September 2020 using a Chi-square test. RESULTS: Over 73% of rural patients had favorable perceptions of telehealth visits, and satisfaction was generally higher among younger patients. Patients reported difficulty with scheduling follow-up appointments, lack of personal contact and technology challenges as common barriers. Over 80% of the 219 providers responding to the survey reported that telehealth added value to their practice, while 36.6% agreed that telehealth visits are more efficient than in-person visits. Perception of telehealth value and efficiency did not differ by provider age (p = 0.67 and p = 0.67, respectively) or time in practice (p = 0.53 and p = 0.44, respectively). Technology challenges for the patient (91.3%) and provider (45.1%) were commonly reported. The percentage of missed appointments was slightly higher for telehealth visits compared to in-person visits, but the difference was not statistically significant (8.7% vs. 8.0%; p = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth perceptions were generally favorable among rural patients and providers, although satisfaction was lower among older patients and providers. Our findings suggest that telehealth approaches may add value and efficiency to rural clinical practice. However, technology issues for both patients and providers and gaps in care coordination need to be addressed to promote sustainability of telehealth approaches in rural practice.",0

How can we elicit health workers' preferences for measures to reduce informal payments? A mixed methods approach to developing a discrete choice experiment in Tanzania.,"OBJECTIVE: While discrete choice experiments (DCEs) have been used in other fields as a means of eliciting respondent preferences, these remain relatively new in studying corrupt practices in the health sector. This study documents and discusses the process of developing a DCE to inform policy measures aimed at addressing informal payments for healthcare in Tanzania. DESIGN: A mixed methods design was used to systematically develop attributes for the DCE. It involved five stages: a scoping literature review, qualitative interviews, a workshop with health providers and managers, expert review and a pilot study. SETTING: Dar es Salaam and Pwani regions in Tanzania. PARTICIPANTS: Health workers and health managers. RESULTS: A large number of factors were identified as driving informal payments in Tanzania and thus represent potential areas for policy intervention. Through iterative process involving different methods (qualitative and quantitative) and seeking consensus views by diverse actors, we derived six attributes for a DCE: mode of payment, supervision at the facility level, opportunity for private practice, awareness and monitoring, disciplinary measures against informal payments and incentive payment for staff if a facility has less informal payments. 12 choice sets were generated and piloted with 15 health workers from 9 health facilities. The pilot study revealed that respondents could easily understand the attributes and levels, answered all the choice sets and appeared to be trading between the attributes. The results from the pilot study had expected signs for all attributes. CONCLUSIONS: We elicited attributes and levels for a DCE to identify the acceptability and preferences of potential policy interventions to address informal payments in Tanzania through a mixed-methods approach. We argue that more attention is needed to the process of defining attributes for the DCE, which needs to be rigorous and transparent in order to derive reliable and policy-relevant findings.",1
Preferences for Anaemia Treatment Attributes among Patients with Non-Dialysis-Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: Information about patient preferences for the treatment of anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is scarce. Hence, our aim was to examine how patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD valued attributes of alternative hypothetical anaemia treatments. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in adult patients who reported a clinical diagnosis of CKD-related anaemia. Treatment attributes included mode and frequency of administration, need for iron supplementation, risk of gastrointestinal side effects, risk of major cardiovascular events and impact on energy levels (as defined by the vitality section of the SF-6D health index). Logit models were used to analyse patients' preferences. RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 200 patients in four countries. Patients preferred an oral mode of administration. Patients were willing to tolerate a 5.1% (95% CI 2.0-8.3%) increase in the risk of a major cardiovascular event and an 11.7% (95% CI 5.0-18.5%) increase in the risk of gastrointestinal side effects to switch from an at-home subcutaneous injection administered once every 2 weeks to an at-home oral pill administered three times a week. Patients were willing to tolerate a 20.3% (95% CI 15.0-25.6%) increase in the risk of gastrointestinal side effects and an 8.9% (95% CI 6.1-11.7%) increase in the risk of a major cardiovascular event to transition from 'Sometimes having a lot of energy' to 'Always having a lot of energy'. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD-related anaemia demonstrated clear treatment preferences and were willing to accept increased gastrointestinal or cardiovascular risks in exchange for more energy or an oral treatment.",1
Diabetes patient preferences for glucose-monitoring technologies: results from a discrete choice experiment in Poland and the Netherlands.,"INTRODUCTION: New glucose-monitoring technologies have different cost-benefit profiles compared with traditional finger-prick tests, resulting in a preference-sensitive situation for patients. This study aimed to assess the relative value adults with diabetes assign to device attributes in two countries. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adults with type 1 or 2 diabetes from the Netherlands (n=226) and Poland (n=261) completed an online discrete choice experiment. Respondents choose between hypothetical glucose monitors described using seven attributes: precision, effort to check, number of finger pricks required, risk of skin irritation, information provided, alarm function and out-of-pocket costs. Panel mixed logit models were used to determine attribute relative importance and to calculate expected uptake rates and willingness to pay (WTP). RESULTS: The most important attribute for both countries was monthly out-of-pocket costs. Polish respondents were more likely than Dutch respondents to choose a glucose-monitoring device over a standard finger prick and had higher WTP for a device. Dutch respondents had higher WTP for device improvements in an effort to check and reduce the number of finger pricks a device requires. CONCLUSION: Costs are the primary concern of patients in both countries when choosing a glucose monitor and would likely hamper real-world uptake. The costs-benefit profiles of such devices should be critically reviewed.",1
Humanistic and Economic Burden of IgA Nephropathy: Systematic Literature Reviews and Narrative Synthesis.,"BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is a progressive inflammatory kidney disease requiring long-term treatment to reduce the risk of progression to kidney failure. Here, we present two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) to identify and summarize literature reporting the humanistic and economic burden of IgAN. METHODS: Electronic literature databases (Ovid Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane) were searched for relevant literature on 29 November 2021, supplemented with gray literature searches. Studies reporting any health-related quality of life (HRQoL) or health state utility outcomes in IgAN patients were included in the humanistic impact SLR, and studies reporting the costs and healthcare resource utilization associated with or economic models of IgAN disease management were included in the economic burden SLR. Narrative synthesis was used to discuss the heterogeneous studies included in the SLRs. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines were followed, and all included studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Center for Evidence-Based Management tool for Critical Appraisal of a Survey or the Drummond Checklist. RESULTS: A total of 876 and 1122 references were identified from electronic and gray literature searches for humanistic and economic burden, respectively. Three studies reporting humanistic impact and five studies reporting economic burden met criteria for inclusion in these SLRs. The included humanistic studies reported patient preferences in the USA and China, HRQoL for patients with IgAN in Poland, and impact of exercise on HRQoL for patients with IgAN in China. The five economic studies reported costs of IgAN treatment in Canada, Italy, and China, along with two economic models from Japan. DISCUSSION: Current literature suggests IgAN is associated with substantial humanistic and economic burdens. However, these SLRs demonstrate the paucity of research conducted to specifically describe the humanistic or economic burden of IgAN and highlight the need for further research.",0
Practices and Views of US Oncologists and Genetic Counselors Regarding Patient Recontact After Variant Reclassification: Results of a Nationwide Survey.,"PURPOSE: Over a 5-year or 10-year period, between 6% and 15% of germline cancer genetic variants undergo reclassification. Up-to-date interpretation can clarify a variant's clinical significance and guide patient management. As the frequency of reclassifications increase, the issue of whether, how, when, and which providers should recontact patients with information about reclassification becomes important. However, the field lacks research evidence and definitive guidance from professional organizations about how providers should recontact patients. We compared the perspectives of US oncologists and cancer genetic counselors (GCs) to describe their practices and views regarding recontact. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a survey using themes identified from semistructured interviews with oncologists and GCs and administered it in a national sample of oncologists and GCs between July and September 2022. RESULTS: In total, 634 respondents completed the survey including 349 oncologists and 285 GCs. On frequency of recontacting patients with reclassified results, 40% of GCs reported recontacting often compared with 12.5% of oncologists. Neither group reported recording patient preference for recontact on electronic medical record (EMR). Both groups agreed that all reclassified variants, even those that do not affect clinical management, should be returned to patients. They also reported that recontact via EMR messages, mailed letters, and phone calls from GC assistants were more suitable for downgrades. By contrast, face-to-face meetings and phone calls were preferred for upgrades. Remarkably, oncologists were more likely to endorse face-to-face return of results and were more likely to endorse return through a nongenetics provider compared to GCs. CONCLUSION: These data on current recontact practices and opinions provide a foundation for developing guidelines with explicit recommendations on patient recontact that can help maximize clinical effect while considering provider preferences for recontact within resource-constrained genomic practice settings.",0

[Cosmetic outcome of nasal tip reconstruction with the frontonasal flap and other locoregional flaps - Cosmetic Outcome of Nasal Tip Reconstruction].,"BACKGROUND: This study investigates the results of nasal tip reconstruction with the frontonasal flap compared with other locoregional flaps. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All nasal tip reconstructions with locoregional flaps performed during a 10-year period were included. Defect size, flap type, risk factors, comorbidities, complications, revisions, and secondary operations were retrospectively assessed. Clinical follow-up examinations were performed after 12 months. Digital photographs were taken in standard projections preoperatively and at the time of the last follow-up examination, and the aesthetic results were assessed by three independent examiners, with nasal contour, symmetry, scarring, and match of skin colour between flap and nasal skin rated on a 4-point scale. Finally, patient satisfaction was obtained. RESULTS: A total of 112 nasal tip reconstructions were performed in 68 women and 44 men with a mean age of 71,4±10,2 years. Taking into account defect size, individual factors and patient preference, reconstruction was performed with 58 frontonasal flaps, 23 Rintala flaps, 20 paramedian forehead flaps and 11 bilobed flaps. Mean age and comorbidities of patients were comparable between flap types, except for a higher incidence of arterial hypertension and a lower incidence of diabetes mellitus in patients treated with frontonasal flaps. Defect size was the same in reconstructions with frontonasal flaps and Rintala flaps, smaller in bilobed flaps, and more extensive in paramedian forehead flaps. There were no differences in complication rates between the different flap techniques. Taking into account the planned second interventions (flap pedicle separations) in the paramedian forehead flaps, the frequency of unplanned corrections was comparable for all flap techniques. Aesthetic results and patient satisfaction were rated as very good or good in more than 90% with all techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the paramedian forehead flap, the frontonasal flap avoids a planned secondary procedure and an extensive donor defect. It allows for the coverage of defects at least the size of the Rintala flap and larger defects than the bilobed flap.",0
Management of Lobular Neoplasia Diagnosed by Core Biopsy.,"Lobular neoplasia (LN) involves proliferative changes within the breast lobules. LN is divided into lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH). LCIS can be further subdivided into three subtypes: classic LCIS, pleomorphic LCIS, and LCIS with necrosis (florid type). Because classic LCIS is now considered as a benign etiology, current guidelines recommend close follow-up with imaging versus surgical excision. The goal of our study was to determine if the diagnosis of classic LN on core needle biopsy (CNB) merits surgical excision. This is a retrospective, observational study conducted at Mount Auburn Hospital, Cambridge, MA, from May 17, 2017, through June 30, 2020. We reviewed the data of breast biopsies conducted at our hospital over this period and included patients who were diagnosed with classic LN (LCIS and/or ALH) and excluded patients having any other atypical lesions on CNB. All known cancer patients were excluded. Of the 2707 CNBs performed during the study period, we identified 68 women who were diagnosed with ALH or LCIS on CNB. CNB was performed for an abnormal mammogram in the majority of patients (60; 88%) while 7(10.3%) had an abnormal breast magnetic resonance imaging study (MRI), and 1 had an abnormal ultrasound (US). A total of 58 patients (85%) underwent excisional biopsy, of which 3 (5.2%) showed malignancy, including 2 cases of DCIS and 1 invasive carcinoma. In addition, there was 1 case (1.7%) with pleomorphic LCIS and 11 cases with ADH (15.5%). The management of LN found on core biopsy is evolving, with some advocating surgical excision and others recommending observation. Our data show a change in diagnosis with excisional biopsy in 13 (22.4%) of patients with 2 cases of DCIS, 1 invasive carcinoma, 1 pleomorphic LCIS, and 9 cases of ADH, diagnosed on excisional biopsy. While ALH and classic LCIS are considered benign, the choice of ongoing surveillance versus excisional biopsy should be made with shared decision making with the patient, with consideration of personal and family history, as well as patient preferences.",0
Physician factors affecting patient preferences in selecting a primary care provider: A qualitative research study in Singapore.,"BACKGROUND: Care continuity by a dedicated, well-trained primary care physician (PCP) has shown to improve health outcomes of patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs). In Singapore's fee-for-service primary care system, patients can choose to consult any PCP in either a public (polyclinic), private (General Practitioners/ GP), or both types of clinics, resulting in potential fragmented care. Decision-making by patients in selecting their preferred PCP remains unclear. This study aims to explore the personal factors influencing the choice of PCP among patients with NCDs in primary care. METHODS: This qualitative research study was conducted in a typical polyclinic. In-depth interviews were conducted on patients with NCDs. Purposive sampling was implemented to enrol patients who had previously consulted PCPs in polyclinics and GP clinics, garnering their perspectives and experiences of care received from both providers. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and audited. Data was coded and analysed using thematic content analysis to identify emerging themes. The physician-specific factors which influence patients' decision-making of PCP selection are presented here. RESULTS: Twenty-one Asian patients aged 38 to 82 years were interviewed. They preferred PCPs with an approachable and genuine demeanour, exhibiting empathy and compassion. They valued the PCPs' verbal, non-verbal and listening skills. Regarding professional qualities, patients wanted PCPs to demonstrate competency and a patient-centred care approach. Some selected their PCP based on compatible age and gender that they felt comfortable with. Establishing good rapport with their PCP and maintaining continuity of care were deemed as major factors in patients' PCP selection. CONCLUSION: Patients tended to select PCPs based on their personal characteristics, interpersonal skills, professional attributes, demographics, and the physician-patient relationship. PCPs should be aware of these attributes and demonstrate them during their patient interaction. Leveraging on this enables PCPs to build rapport with their patients and maintain care continuity to optimize their health outcomes.",0
Comparison of patient preferences and responsiveness among common patient-reported outcome measures for hand/wrist injuries or disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were developed to examine patients' perceptions of functional health. Most studies compare the responsiveness of each type of questionnaire. However, reports of patient preferences among PROMs commonly used with patients with hand/wrist injuries or disorders are limited. This study aimed to compare patient preferences, factors associated with those preferences and responsiveness among the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH), Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ), Patient-Rated Wrist/Hand Evaluation (PRWHE) and EQ-5D in patients with hand/wrist injuries or disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study collected data on 183 patients with hand/wrist injuries or diseases who had visited a hand/wrist outpatient clinic or were hospitalized for surgery between 2017 and 2020. Patients had to be at least 18 years old and able to complete the four questionnaires included in the study. The four PROMs (DASH, MHQ, PRWHE and EQ-5D) were administered to the patients prior to treatment. After completing the questionnaires, patients were asked to answer two open-ended questions regarding their preferences. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify factors related to patient preferences. Results are presented as the relative risk ratio (RRR). The standardized response mean (SRM) was used to evaluate questionnaire responsiveness. RESULTS: Of the 183 patients, most preferred the PRWHE questionnaire (n = 74, 41%), with the main reasons cited being ""specific to injuries/diseases and reflects hand/wrist function (n = 23, 31%)"" and ""easy to complete (n = 22, 30%)."" Sex was found to be associated with patient preference after adjusting for demographic data and reasons for choosing a PROM as confounders (RRR = 0.46, P value = 0.049). The PRWHE had the highest SRM, followed by DASH (0.92 and 0.88, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The PRWHE is the most preferred by patients and is the most responsive questionnaire. It is recommended for use in clinical practice in situations where a clinician would like to use only one PROM for evaluating patients with various types of hand/wrist problems. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic III.",0
Patients' Preferences for Connected Insulin Pens: A Discrete Choice Experiment Among Patients with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.,"BACKGROUND: This study quantified how people with diabetes value the unique features of connected insulin pens and related mobile apps, and the underlying reasons for preferring connected versus non-connected insulin pens. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in the USA and UK to elicit preferences of adults (≥ 18 years) with type 1 or 2 diabetes for attributes of insulin pens. Attributes included device type, dosing support, glucose monitoring, additional app features, and data sharing. Relative attribute importance (RAI) scores were calculated to capture the relative importance of an attribute. Predicted choice probabilities were obtained to compare different profiles for connected and non-connected insulin pens. RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 540 participants (58.9% male; 90.7% Caucasian; mean age, 58.3 years; 69.4% type 2 diabetes). Participants most valued the possibility of using a connected insulin pen with dosing support and automated dose logging (RAI = 39.9%), followed by automatic transfer of glucose levels (RAI = 29.0%), additional features of tracking diet and physical activity (RAI = 14.6%), data sharing (RAI = 13.6%), and device type (RAI = 2.9%). All profiles of connected insulin pens were preferred over a non-connected pen (p < 0.001), and pen profiles with advanced features were preferred over those without (p < 0.001). Preferences differed by age but not diabetes type, country of residence, or insulin regimen. CONCLUSION: People with diabetes in the USA and UK prefer connected over non-connected insulin pens due largely to the availability of automated logging of dose and glucose levels.",1
Enhancing Patient Choice: Using Self-administered Intranasal Naloxone for Novel Rapid Buprenorphine Initiation.,"Buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) is a lifesaving treatment for opioid use disorder. The increasing use of illicitly manufactured fentanyl, however, has made initiating BUP-NX more likely to precipitate withdrawal-an experience that deters treatment and causes return to use. If BUP-NX cannot be successfully started, it cannot work. We describe the case of a patient who was able to transition to a therapeutic dose of BUP-NX less than 3 hours after his last illicitly manufactured fentanyl use by choosing to self-administer intranasal naloxone. After the naloxone, the transition took 31 minutes, including 14 minutes of expected moderately severe withdrawal. He remains in care with BUP-NX and would recommend this transition approach to others.",0
