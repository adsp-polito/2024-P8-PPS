Muscle activity and rehabilitation in spinal stenosis (MARSS) after conservative therapy and surgical decompression with or without fusion: Protocol for a partially randomized patient preference trial on rehabilitation timing.,"BACKGROUND: Patients affected by lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) suffer from a multifactorial degeneration of the lumbar spine resulting in narrowing of the neuroforamina and spinal canal, leading to various functional limitations. It remains unclear whether LSS patients after surgery would benefit from early post-operative rehabilitation, or if a delayed rehabilitation would be more advantageous. The purpose of this partially randomized patient preference trial is to evaluate the impact of post-operative rehabilitation timing as well as surgical intervention type on psychometric properties and functional outcomes in patients with LSS. METHODS: Data for this patient preference trial are collected before and after surgical (decompression only or decompression and fusion) and rehabilitative interventions as well as six, 12 and 24 months after completing rehabilitation. The study participants are patients diagnosed with LSS who are at least 18 years old. After a medical check-up, participants will complete patient-reported outcome measures (PAREMO-20, SIBAR, FREM-8, SF-12, SFI, ODI) and different functional assessments (functional reach test, loaded reach test, handgrip strength, standing balance control, 6-min walk test). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The results of this study will be published through peer-reviewed publications and scientific contributions at national and international conferences. This research has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (reference number: 2022-128).",0
Telephone versus video consultations: A systematic review of comparative effectiveness studies and guidance for choosing the most appropriate modality.,"OBJECTIVE: This systematic review compared clinical, service and cost effectiveness of telephone consultations (TC) to video consultations (VC). METHODS: We searched Embase, CINAHL and MEDLINE for empirical studies that compared TC to VC using clinical, service or economic outcome measures. Clinician or patient preference and satisfaction studies were excluded. Findings were synthesised descriptively. RESULTS: A total of 79 articles were included. The most effective modality was found to be VC in 40 studies (50%) and TC in 3 (4%). VC and TC were found to be equivalent in 28 of the included articles (35%). VC were superior or equivalent to TC for all clinical outcomes. When compared to TC, VC were likely to have better patient engagement and retention, to improve transfer decisions, and reduce downstream sub-acute care utilisation. The impact of telehealth modality on consultation time, completion rates, failure-to-attend rates and acute care utilisation was mixed. VC were consistently found to be more cost effective despite having a higher incremental cost than TC. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review demonstrates equal or better, but not inferior clinical and cost outcomes for consultations delivered by VC when compared to TC. VC appear to be more clinically effective when visual information is required, when verbal communication with the patient is impaired and when patient engagement and retention is linked to clinical outcomes. We have provided conditions where VC should be used in preference to TC. These can be used by clinicians to guide the choice of telehealth modality. Cost effectiveness is also important to consider when choosing modality.",0
Patient Decision Making in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Discrete Choice Experiment Examining Graft Preference.,"BACKGROUND: Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) and hamstring autografts are the most common grafts used for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Patient preferences should be accounted for as a part of shared decision making. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to perform a discrete choice experiment that evaluated patient preferences toward ACL autografts. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in patient preferences between groups. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Patients aged 18 to 25 years who underwent shoulder arthroscopy at a single institution between 2013 and 2019 were included in the study as a proxy for healthy controls. Patients with a history of ACL tear were excluded. A discrete choice experiment was developed from a literature search and used the following data points as they pertain to BTB or hamstring autograft: risk of developing a significant complication, return-to-play rate, risk of anterior knee pain with kneeling, and risk of additional surgery due to graft failure. Included patients completed a custom survey in which they were asked to choose between ""surgery A"" (hamstring) and ""surgery B"" (BTB). RESULTS: A total of 107 participants were included in the analysis. Of these participants, 39 (36.5%) chose surgery A (hamstring) and 68 (63.6%) chose surgery B (BTB). When comparing the hamstring group with the BTB group, there was no significant difference in age, sex, body mass index, race, level of education, or employment status. However, 80.5% of self-reported athletes preferred BTB (P = .008). When controlling for age, sex, and body mass index, patients in the BTB group were more likely to rate return to sport (risk ratio [RR] = 1.49 [95% CI, 1.18-1.98]; P = .001) and the risk of requiring additional surgery due to graft failure (RR = 1.26 [95% CI, 1.02-1.58]; P = .037) as highly important. Conversely, they were less likely than patients in the hamstring group to rate pain while kneeling (RR = 0.65 [95% CI, 0.98-1.05]; P < .001) and complication risk (RR = 0.75 [95% CI, 0.59-0.94]; P = .013) as important. CONCLUSION: The study hypothesis was rejected, as patient values did affect ACL graft choice preference. Utilizing patient-selected values in a quantifiable way can benefit the shared decision-making process before ACL reconstruction.",1
Patient preferences for anti-hyperglycaemic medication for type 2 diabetes mellitus in China: findings from a national survey.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the preferences regarding risks, benefits and other treatment attributes of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in China when selecting a second-line anti-hyperglycaemic medicine. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment with hypothetical anti-hyperglycaemic medication profiles was performed using a face-to-face survey administered to patients with T2DM. The medication profile was described using seven attributes: treatment efficacy, hypoglycaemia risk, cardiovascular benefits, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events, weight change, mode of administration and out-of-pocket cost. Participants chose between medication profiles by comparing attributes. Data were analysed using a mixed logit model with marginal willingness to pay (mWTP) and maximum acceptable risk (MAR) calculated. The preference heterogeneity within the sample was explored using a latent class model (LCM). RESULTS: A total of 3327 respondents from five major geographical regions completed the survey. Treatment efficacy, hypoglycaemia risk, cardiovascular benefits and GI adverse events were major concerns among the seven attributes measured. Weight change and mode of administration were of lesser concern. Regarding mWTP, respondents would pay ¥236.1 (US$36.6) for an anti-hyperglycaemic medication with an efficacy of 2.5% points reduction in HbA1c, while they were willing to accept a weight gain of 3 kg only if they received a compensation of ¥56.7 (US$8.8). Respondents were willing to accept a relatively large increase in hypoglycaemia risk (MAR=15.9%) to improve treatment efficacy from intermediate (1.0% points) to high (1.5% points). LCM identified the following four unobserved subgroups: trypanophobia, cardiovascular-benefits-focused, safety-focused and efficacy-focused and cost-sensitive. CONCLUSION: Patients with T2DM prioritised free out-of-pocket costs, highest efficacy, no hypoglycaemia risk and cardiovascular benefits over weight change and mode of administration. There exists great preference heterogeneity among patients, which should be taken into account in healthcare decision-making processes.",1
Psoriasis: a focus on upcoming oral formulations.,"INTRODUCTION: Targeted therapies have greatly improved the quality of life of patients with psoriasis. Despite the extensive list of treatments available, multiple new drugs are being developed, especially oral therapies with potential advantages as regards comfort of administration. However, the efficacy and safety of these new oral therapies need to be improved to match those of novel biologics. AREAS COVERED: We provide a narrative review of the oral therapies for psoriasis that are currently under development, from Jak inhibitors to oral IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors, among others. A literature search was performed for articles published from 1 January 2020, to 6 June 2023. EXPERT OPINION: The approval of deucravacitinib, the first Jak inhibitor for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, heralds a bright therapeutic future with multiple new oral formulations. A great number of oral treatments with singular mechanism of action, like A3AR agonists, HSP90 inhibitors, ROCK-2 inhibitors, oral TNF inhibitors, oral IL-23 inhibitors, oral IL-17 inhibitors, PD4 inhibitors (orismilast) and several Tyk2 inhibitors, are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and could be suitable for approval in the future. Growing variation in treatment modes of administration will allow dermatologists to better integrate patient preferences in the therapeutic decision process.",0
Preference of musculoskeletal pain treatment in middle-aged and elderly chinese people: a machine learning analysis of the China health and retirement longitudinal study.,"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal pain is a major cause of physical disability, associated with huge socioeconomic burden. Patient preference for treatment is an important factor contributing to the choice of treatment strategies. However, effective measurements for evaluating the ongoing management of musculoskeletal pain are lacking. To help improve clinical decision making, it's important to estimate the current state of musculoskeletal pain management and analyze the contribution of patient treatment preference. METHODS: A nationally representative sample for the Chinese population was derived from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Information on the patients' demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, other health-related behavior, as well as history on musculoskeletal pain and treatment data were obtained. The data was used to estimate the status of musculoskeletal pain treatment in China in the year 2018. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were used to find the effect factors of treatment preference. XGBoost model and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method were performed to analyze the contribution of each variable to different treatment preferences. RESULTS: Among 18,814 respondents, 10,346 respondents suffered from musculoskeletal pain. Approximately 50% of musculoskeletal pain patients preferred modern medicine, while about 20% chose traditional Chinese medicine and another 15% chose acupuncture or massage therapy. Differing preferences for musculoskeletal pain treatment was related to the respondents' gender, age, place of residence, education level, insurance status, and health-related behavior such as smoking and drinking. Compared with upper or lower limb pain, neck pain and lower back pain were more likely to make respondents choose massage therapy (P < 0.05). A greater number of pain sites was associated with an increasing preference for respondents to seek medical care for musculoskeletal pain (P < 0.05), while different pain sites did not affect treatment preference. CONCLUSION: Factors including gender, age, socioeconomic status, and health-related behavior may have potential effects on people' s choice of treatment for musculoskeletal pain. The information derived from this study may be useful for helping to inform clinical decisions for orthopedic surgeons when devising treatment strategies for musculoskeletal pain.",0
Modified forced expiration technique using expiratory resistance in adults with cystic fibrosis.,"BACKGROUND: Participation in airway clearance techniques (ACT) is important to minimise development of irreversible airway obstruction in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) and expiratory resistance devices (ERD) are often used as they can improve collateral ventilation and aid in the shearing of mucus from airways. This project looked to identify whether utilising an ERD during a forced expiration technique (FET) improves ease of expectoration, sputum amount and coughing frequency in patients with CF. METHOD: Patients with CF admitted for a respiratory exacerbation completed two sessions of 10 cycles of their usual ACT with half of the FET components performed with an ERD, half with FET alone. RESULTS: EOE, sputum wet weight, cough frequency and patient preference were similar between groups. Improved EOE without the ERD was found in participants who usually use PEP for their ACT regime. CONCLUSION: Combining the FET with a PEP mask did not improve EOE and other outcomes in this small study. Investigating the efficacy of this technique within a larger population is warranted.",0
"Cognitive-behavioural versus cognitive-analytic guided self-help for mild-to-moderate anxiety: a pragmatic, randomised patient preference trial.","BACKGROUND: Guided self-help (GSH) for anxiety is widely implemented in primary care services because of service efficiency gains, but there is also evidence of poor acceptability, low effectiveness and relapse. AIMS: The aim was to compare preferences for, acceptability and efficacy of cognitive-behavioural guided self-help (CBT-GSH) versus cognitive-analytic guided self-help (CAT-GSH). METHOD: This was a pragmatic, randomised, patient preference trial (Clinical trials identifier: NCT03730532). The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was the primary outcome at 8- and 24-week follow-up. Interventions were delivered competently on the telephone via structured workbooks over 6-8 (30-35 min) sessions by trained practitioners. RESULTS: A total of 271 eligible participants were included, of whom 19 (7%) accepted being randomised and 252 (93%) chose their treatment. In the preference cohort, 181 (72%) chose CAT-GSH and 71 (28%) preferred CBT-GSH. BAI outcomes in the preference and randomised cohorts did not differ at 8 weeks (-0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.52 to 2.92) or 24 weeks (0.85, 95% CI -2.87 to 4.57). After controlling for allocation method and baseline covariates, there were no differences between CAT-GSH and CBT-GSH at 8 weeks (F(1, 263) = 0.22, P = 0.639) or at 24 weeks (F(1, 263) = 0.22, P = 0.639). Mean BAI change from baseline was a reduction of 9.28 for CAT-GSH and 9.78 for CBT-GSH at 8 weeks and 12.90 for CAT-GSH and 12.43 for CBT-GSH at 24 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Patients accessing routine primary care talking treatments prefer to choose the intervention they receive. CAT-GSH expands the treatment offer in primary care for patients with anxiety seeking a brief but analytically informed GSH solution.",0
Tretinoin 0.1% and Benzoyl Peroxide 3% Cream for the Treatment of Facial Acne Vulgaris.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, safety, and clinical application of tretinoin 0.1%-benzoyl peroxide 3% cream for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of the literature was performed using the terms Twyneo OR tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide OR S6G5T-3 in MEDLINE (PubMed) and EMBASE. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to obtain completed clinical trial results not published elsewhere. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All human studies published in English prior to November 2022 related to pharmacology, clinical trials, safety, and efficacy were evaluated for inclusion. DATA SYNTHESIS: In two 12-week, phase 3, randomized, vehicle-controlled clinical trials, tretinoin 0.1%-benzoyl peroxide 3% cream significantly reduced inflammatory and noninflammatory facial acne lesions and significantly improved Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) rating to clear or almost clear. The cream has a suitable safety profile, with application site pain and dryness as the most common adverse events. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE IN COMPARISON TO EXISTING AGENTS: Tretinoin-BPO had similar IGA success compared to other topical retinoid and retinoid-BPO treatments for acne vulgaris. Compared to individual tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide therapy, the combination product streamlines application, which will improve medication adherence; however, the cost of tretinoin-BPO cream may be prohibitive. CONCLUSIONS: Tretinoin 0.1%-benzoyl peroxide 3% cream is safe and effective for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. Long-term trial data on efficacy and tolerability are not yet available.",0
Patients' preferences for chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment: The CHOICE study.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) therapies differ in efficacy, side effects, route, frequency, and duration of administration. We assessed patient preferences for treatment attributes and evaluated associations with disease stage, treatment line, and socio-demographic characteristics in a cross sectional, observational study conducted at 16 Italian hematology centers. Study visits occurred between February and July 2020; 401 adult patients with CLL (201 Watch and Wait (W&W), 200 treated) participated in a discrete choice experiment (DCE), composed of 8 choices between pairs of treatment profiles with different levels of 5 attributes of currently available CLL treatments (length of response, route and duration of administration, risk of side effects including diarrhea, infections, or organ damage). Health-related quality of life was assessed with the EQ-5D-5L, EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ CLL-16. Previously treated patients had longer disease duration (7 vs. 5 years), higher prevalence of serious comorbidities (45.5% vs. 36.2%) and high-risk molecular markers (unmutated IGHV 55.6% vs. 17.1%; TP53 mutation 15.2% vs. 4.0%). Health-related quality of life scores were similar between groups. In the DCE, W&W patients rated ""possible occurrence of infections"" highest (relative importance [RI] = 36.2%), followed by ""treatment and relevant duration"" (RI = 28.0%) and ""progression-free survival (PFS)"" (RI = 16.9%). Previously treated patients rated ""treatment and relevant duration"" highest (RI = 33.3%), followed by ""possible occurrence of infections"" (RI = 28.8%), ""possible occurrence of organ damage"" (RI = 19.4%), and ""PFS"" (RI = 9.8%). Concern over infection was rated highest overall; unexpectedly PFS was not among the most important criteria in either group, suggesting that the first COVID-19 pandemic wave may have influenced patient preferences and concerns about CLL therapy options.",1
Long-Term Follow Up of Sexual Function and Steroid Levels in Women after Perimenopausal Hysterectomy with or without Concomitant Oophorectomy.,"Hysterectomy, most often performed because of bleeding disorders or uterine leiomyoma, is one of the most common major surgical procedures in women and is usually performed during the perimenopausal period on ages 45-55 years. Hysterectomy may be combined with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, as a risk-reducing procedure to minimize the risk of ovarian cancer. An open question is whether concomitant oophorectomy, with cessation of ovarian androgen secretion, has any long-term effects on sexual function. In the present prospective cohort study of women undergoing benign hysterectomy, the long-term (10-12 years) effects on sexual function and changes in sex hormone levels were investigated in women having undergone perimenopausal hysterectomy, with or without concomitant bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Originally, 491 women (mean age around 50 years) were operated with (patient preference) either only hysterectomy (HYST) or hysterectomy plus bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (HYST + BSO), and 441 women (90%; HYST; n = 271 and HYST + BSO; n = 170) completed a one-year survey. In the present study, 185 women (42%) of the cohort with one-year follow up participated in the long-term follow up after 10-12 years. Follow-up was with the 10-item McCoy Female Sex Questionnaire and blood analysis of levels of testosterone, estradiol and sexual-hormone-binding globulin. The results showed that specific aspects of sexual function were lower after HYST + BSO compared to HYST 10-12 years after surgery. These lowered items were frequency of sexual fantasies, enjoyment of sexual activity, sexual arousal, and orgasmic frequency. No long-term differences in sex hormone levels were found between the two groups. In conclusion, some items related to sexual function were lower after HYST + BSO in a long-term perspective study, although the levels of testosterone were unaltered. This finding may have implications for clinical recommendations concerning prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy or for hysterectomy during the perimenopausal age.",0
Digital solution in the follow-up of early breast cancer a randomized study.,"BACKGROUND: After primary treatment, patients with early breast cancer (EBC) are followed-up for at least 5 years. At the Helsinki University Hospital (HUS) surveillance includes appointments at 1, 3 and 5 years, and between pre-planned visits a phone call service operated by a nurse practitioner for counseling about symptoms related to side-effects or potential recurrence. In 2015 HUS launched a digital solution for cancer patients. This study was designed to find out patient preference, Health related (HR) quality of life (QOL) and satisfaction with a digital solution compared to a phone call service during the first year of follow-up. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with EBC were randomized at the final visit of radiotherapy to surveillance by phone calls or by the digital Noona solution during the first year outside pre-planned visits. After six months the groups were crossed over to the other arm. Primary endpoint was patient preference for either follow-up method among those who had contacted the study nurse at least once by both phone service and digital solution. RESULTS: Out of the 765 patients randomized, 142 had contacted the hospital with both methods and were eligible for inclusion in the analyses of the present study. Out of the 142 patients, 56 preferred phone calls, 43 the digital solution while 43 considered both modalities equal. Preference for the digital solution was higher among patients aged 65 or less. There were no differences in HR QoL or overall satisfaction between the modalities. However, the patients rated the timeliness of response better while using the digital solution. CONCLUSION: Of the patients 30% preferred the digital solution, 40% phone calls while 30% found them equal as the primary follow-up method for EBC during the first year outside pre-planned visits. There is a need to include also digital solutions in surveillance of EBC. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT04980989.",0
'My doctor should decide' - Predictors for healthcare users' stated preferences regarding medical decision-making.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate predictors for healthcare users' declared decision control preferences and test their association with satisfaction in vignettes detailing various decision-making. METHODS: Cross-sectional vignette survey within a representative general male population aged 45-70 years (response rate 30%). Survey vignettes illustrated different levels of patient involvement. Participants rated their satisfaction with healthcare illustrated and separately rated their 'control preferences'. Comparisons were conducted with linear regression. RESULTS: Preferring the doctor to predominantly or exclusively decide (1588/6755 respondents) was associated with older age, being single, lower education, having chronic illness, and living in low-income and less populated areas, with fewer non-western immigrants. Following adjustment, lower education and chronic illness remained statistically significant. Personalities with less openness had preference for least control. When presented with specific clinical scenarios, respondents preferring active or passive roles were equally satisfied with scenarios demonstrating shared decision-making. DISCUSSION: Some groups of healthcare users were more likely to say that they preferred their doctor to decide. However, findings suggest that control preference statements, prior to facing a decision, should be interpreted with caution. PRACTICAL VALUE: Study findings highlight that patients vary regarding their expressed wish for control in medical decision-making but they seem equally satisfied with shared decision-making scenarios.",0
Evaluating Patient Preferences and Clinical Outcomes for Modified Laparoscopic Burch Colposuspension and Transobturator Tape Procedures in Stress Urinary Incontinence Treatment.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide an in-depth analysis of patient preferences and clinical outcomes associated with two prominent surgical techniques for treating Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI): the modified laparoscopic Burch colposuspension and the transobturator tape (TOT) procedure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted on 145 patients who recieved surgical treatment for SUI, of which 71 patients (49%) underwent the modified laparoscopic Burch procedure, while 74 patients (51%) received the TOT procedure. Data on clinical characteristics, treatment success rates, and postoperative outcomes were collected and analyzed to understand patient preferences and real-world clinical effectiveness. RESULTS: This study revealed notable differences in patient demographics and clinical characteristics between the two groups. At the 2-year follow-up, a success rate of 100% was reported in the modified laparoscopic Burch group and 86.48% in the TOT group. A total of 99 patients (68.28%) were considered cured postoperatively, with 47 (66.20%) in the modified laparoscopic Burch group and 52 (70.27%) in the TOT group (p = 0.598). A significant difference was found in the incidence of dyspareunia, with six cases (8.10%) reported in the TOT group, compared to none reported in the modified laparoscopic Burch group (p = 0.028). The median operation time was significantly shorter in the TOT group, namely 15 min, compared to the modified laparoscopic Burch group, which had a median equal to 27 min (p < 0.001). Despite these differences, patient preference for either surgical technique was observed, along with similar success rates and varied postoperative outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide a comprehensive overview of patient preferences and factual clinical outcomes for the two surgical techniques in SUI treatment. This study contributes to understanding the factors influencing patient choice and offers valuable insights into the real-world application of these techniques, enhancing patient-centered care in SUI management.",0

Evaluating Measurement Properties of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Glaucoma: A Systematic Review.,"TOPIC: The purpose of the current study was to systematically identify and evaluate existing patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for clinical glaucoma practice. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Understanding and incorporating patient preferences into decision-making is now recognized as critical for optimal resource allocation, especially in technologically advancing areas, such as minimally invasive surgeries. Patient-reported outcome measures are instruments designed to evaluate the health outcomes that are most important to patients. Despite their recognized importance, especially in the era of patient-centered care, their routine use in clinical settings remains low. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in 6 databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, BIOSIS, and Web of Science) from the date of inception. Studies were included in the qualitative review if they reported measurement properties of PROMs in adult patients with glaucoma. COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments guidelines were used to assess the included PROMs. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42020176064). RESULTS: The literature search yielded 2661 records. After deduplication, 1259 studies entered level 1 screening, and based on title and abstract review, 164 records proceeded to full-text screening. In 48 included studies, 70 instrument reports discuss 43 distinct instruments in 3 major categories: glaucoma-specific, vision-specific, and general health-related quality of life. Most used measures were glaucoma-specific (Glaucoma Quality of Life [GQL] and Glaucoma Symptom Scale [GSS]) and vision-specific (National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire [NEI VFQ-25]). All 3 have sufficient validity (especially construct), with GQL and GSS having sufficient internal consistency, cross-cultural validity, and reliability, with reports suggesting high methodological quality. CONCLUSION: The GQL, GSS, and NEI VFQ-25 are the 3 most used questionnaires in a research setting, having considerable validation in a patient population with glaucoma. Limited reports on interpretability, responsiveness, and feasibility in all 43 identified instruments make identifying a single optimal questionnaire for clinical use challenging and highlight the need for further studies.

Low Trend for VZV-Associated Disease Patients to Visit Neurologists.,"BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster (HZ) is a skin disease that can also cause virus-infectious peripheral neuropathies. Despite this, there is limited information on patient preferences for seeking medical attention for HZ and zoster-associated pain (ZAP). Our study aimed to evaluate how frequently patients with ZAP choose to visit neurologists for their symptoms. METHODS: This study conducted a retrospective review of electronic health records in three general hospitals from January 2017 to June 2022. Using association rule mining, the study analyzed referral behaviors. RESULTS: We identified 33,633 patients with 111,488 outpatient visits over 5.5 years. The study found that the majority of patients (74.77-91.22%) visited dermatologists during their first outpatient visit, while only a small percentage (0.86-1.47%) preferred to consult a neurologist. The proportion of patients referred to a specialist during their medical visit varied significantly between different specialties within the same hospital (p <0.05) and even within the same specialty (p<0.05). There was a weak association (Lift:1.00-1.17) of referral behaviors between dermatology and neurology. Across the three hospitals, the average number of visits to a neurologist for ZAP was 1.42-2.49, with an average electronic health record duration of 11-15 days per patient. After consulting with a neurologist, some patients were referred to other specialists. CONCLUSION: It was observed that patients with HZ and ZAP tended to visit a variety of specialists, with only a small number seeking the assistance of neurologists. However, from the perspective of neuroprotection, it is the duty of neurologists to provide more means.",0
Pharmacologic Treatment Strategies in Psoriatic Arthritis.,"PURPOSE: The goal of this narrative review was to provide current data on psoriatic arthritis (PsA) therapeutic strategies, supporting treatment decisions with a domain-based approach. METHODS: This narrative review of treatment strategies for PsA focused on several disease domains (ie, peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, axial disease, dactylitis, skin and nail disease), as well as the so-called ""related conditions"" of uveitis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, international guidelines, and recent congress abstracts. FINDINGS: Currently, multiple approved treatment options offer a wide range of options, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors; inhibitors of interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-12/23 (IL-12/23), IL-23 (IL-23), and Janus kinase; the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor apremilast; and the T-cell modulator abatacept. However, no treatment option shows clear superiority concerning efficacy on peripheral arthritis and dactylitis over the others, whereas limited evidence suggests that the IL-17 inhibitor ixekizumab and the IL-12/23 inhibitor ustekinumab may be superior to TNF inhibitors in treating enthesitis. Recent data on enthesitis have also shown promising results for methotrexate. Treatment of axial PsA is mostly derived from axial spondyloarthritis, and more data are needed focusing on this specific subgroup of PsA patients. Thus far, the most important finding from the only randomized controlled trial in this specific population is that the IL-17 inhibitor secukinumab was superior to placebo in terms of clinical and radiologic end-points in axial PsA. Regarding psoriatic skin involvement, head-to-head trials in PsA as well as skin psoriasis showed the superiority of IL-17, IL-23, and IL-12/23 inhibitors over TNF inhibitors. When treating PsA with concurrent uveitis, according to the existing data, monoclonal TNF inhibitor antibodies should be preferred. In PsA and concomitant inflammatory bowel disease, treatment decisions must include the consideration of which specific type of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) is present, as some of the agents either lack data or are ineffective in treating these 2 conditions. In both types, IL-17 inhibitors should be avoided. When determining treatment strategy, comorbidities should be carefully assessed, and the corresponding risk profile of the respective treatment modalities should be taken into consideration. IMPLICATIONS: There are many approved therapeutic options for treating patients with PsA, and additional emerging treatment options are in the pipeline. Individualized treatment decisions for each patient, depending on the leading disease phenotype, underlying comorbidities, and patient preferences, should be made based on shared decision-making.",0
Patient Perspectives of the Hospital Discharge Process: A Qualitative Study.,"Care transitions after hospitalization require communication across care teams, patients, and caregivers. As part of a quality improvement initiative, we conducted qualitative interviews with a diverse group of 53 patients who were recently discharged from a hospitalization within a safety net hospital to explore how patient preferences were included in the hospital discharge process and differences in the hospital discharge experience by race/ethnicity. Four themes emerged from participants regarding desired characteristics of interactions with the discharge team: (1) to feel heard, (2) inclusion in decision-making, (3) to be adequately prepared to care for themselves at home through bedside teaching, (4) and to have a clear and updated discharge timeline. Additionally, participants identified patient-level factors the discharge planning team should consider, including the social context, family involvement, health literacy, and linguistic barriers. Lastly, participants identified provider characteristics, such as a caring and empathetic bedside manner, that they found valuable in the discharge process. Our findings highlight the need for shared decision-making in the discharge planning process to improve both patient safety and satisfaction.",0
Donor Site Satisfaction Following Autologous Fat Transfer for Total Breast Reconstruction.,"BACKGROUND: With evolving breast cancer survival and patient preferences, it is essential that reconstructive surgeons worldwide continue searching for the best reconstruction technique for patients. Autologous fat transfer (AFT) is a relatively new technique for total breast reconstruction that has already proven to be effective and safe with all advantages of autologous tissue. However, little is known about the aesthetic results and satisfaction concerning donor sites. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to measure donor site satisfaction following AFT for total breast reconstruction in breast cancer patients. METHODS: Between May and August of 2021, participants of the BREAST- trial who were at least 24 months after their final reconstruction surgery were invited to complete an additional survey concerning donor sites. The BODY-Q was utilized for data collection. Results of AFT patients were compared with a control group of implant-based reconstruction patients who did not have a donor site. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients (20 control, 31 intervention) completed the questionnaire. Satisfaction with body did not statistically differ between the groups. The most frequent complaint was contour irregularities (31 reports, 60.8%), with the least favorable donor site being thighs (23 reports, 53.5%) in the AFT group. CONCLUSIONS: Satisfaction with body did not differ between breast cancer patients receiving AFT or implant-based reconstruction, meaning that large-volume liposuction does not aesthetically affect the utilized donor sites. Nevertheless, reconstructive surgeons should be aware of possible donor site complications, especially contour irregularities at the thighs, and discuss this with their patients.",0
"Quality of life, patient preferences, and implant survival and success of tapered implant-retained mandibular overdentures as a function of the attachment system.","PURPOSE: A novel attachment system for implant-retained overdentures (IRODs) with novel material combinations for improved mechanical resilience and prosthodontic success (Novaloc) has been recently introduced as an alternative to an existing system (Locator). This study investigated whether differences between the Novaloc and Locator attachment systems translate into differences in implant survival, implant success, and patient-centered outcomes when applied in a real-world in-practice comparative setting in patients restored with mandibular IRODs supported by 2 interforaminal implants (2-IRODs). METHODS: This prospective, intra-subject crossover comparison compared 20 patients who received 2 intra-foraminal bone level tapered implants restored with full acrylic overdentures using either the Locator or Novaloc attachment system. After 6 months of function, the attachment in the corresponding dentures was switched, and the definitive attachment system type was delivered based on the patient's preference after 12 months. For the definitive attachment system, implant survival was evaluated after 24 months. The primary outcomes of this study were oral health-related quality of life and patient preferences related to prosthetic and implant survival. Secondary outcomes included implant survival rate and success, prosthetic survival, perceived general health, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Patient-centered outcomes and patient preferences between attachment systems were comparable, with relatively high overall patient satisfaction levels for both attachment systems. No difference in the prosthetic survival rate between study groups was detected. The implant survival rate over the follow-up period after 24 months in both groups was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this in-practice comparison indicate that both attachment systems represent comparable candidates for the prosthodontic retention of 2-IRODs. Both systems showed high rates of patient satisfaction and implant survival. The influence of material combinations of the retentive system on treatment outcomes between the tested systems remains inconclusive and requires further investigations.",0
Development of a novel shared decision making aid for primary immunodeficiency diseases.,"Aim: To describe development of a shared decision making (SDM) aid in treating primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) with immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IGRT). Materials & methods: Expert engagement and qualitative formative research informed development. IGRT administration features were prioritized using object-case best-worst scaling (BWS) methodology. The aid was assessed by US adults self-reporting PID and revised following interviews/mock treatment-choice discussions with immunologists. Results: Patients participating in interviews (n = 19) and mock treatment-choice discussions (n = 5) deemed the aid useful/accessible and supported the utility of BWS, with content and BWS exercises refined following participant feedback. Conclusion: Formative research led to an improved SDM aid/BWS exercise, and illustrated how the aid may improve treatment decision making. The aid may help less-experienced patients and facilitate efficient SDM.",1
Derivation of a UK preference-based value set for the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS) to allow estimation of Mental Well-being Adjusted Life Years (MWALYs).,"BACKGROUND: The Mental Well-being Adjusted Life Year (MWALY) is an alternative outcome measure to the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in economic evaluations of interventions aimed at improving mental well-being. However, there is a lack of preference-based mental well-being instruments for capturing population mental well-being preferences. OBJECTIVES: To derive a UK preference-based value set for the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS). METHODS: 225 participants that were interviewed between December 2020 and August 2021 completed 10 composite time trade-off (C-TTO) and 10 discrete choice experiment (DCE) interviewer-administered exercises. Heteroskedastic Tobit and conditional logit models were used to model C-TTO and DCE responses respectively. The DCE utility values were rescaled to a C-TTO comparable scale through anchoring and mapping. An inverse variance weighting hybrid model (IVWHM) was used to derive weighted-average coefficients from the modelled C-TTO and DCE coefficients. Model performance was assessed using statistical diagnostics. RESULTS: The valuation responses confirmed the feasibility and face validity of the C-TTO and DCE techniques. Apart from the main effects models, statistically significant associations were estimated between the predicted C-TTO value and participants' SWEMWBS scores, gender, ethnicities, education levels, and the interaction terms between age and useful feeling. The IVWHM was the most optimal model with the fewest logically inconsistent coefficients and the lowest pooled standard errors. The utility values generated by the rescaled DCE models and the IVWHM were generally higher than those of the C-TTO model. The predictive ability of the two DCE rescaling methods was similar according to the mean absolute deviation and root mean square deviation statistics. CONCLUSIONS: This study has produced the first preference-based value set for a measure of mental well-being. The IVWHM provided a desirable blend of both C-TTO and DCE models. The value set derived by this hybrid approach can be used for cost-utility analyses of mental well-being interventions.",1
Endocrine Therapy for Primary and Secondary Prevention After Diagnosis of High-Risk Breast Lesions or Preinvasive Breast Cancer.,"The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice.Patients with high-risk breast lesions (HRLs) or preinvasive breast cancers face an elevated risk of future breast cancer diagnoses. Endocrine therapy in this setting reduces the risk of a future diagnosis but does not confer improved survival, thus the side effects of primary/secondary prevention must be considered relative to the benefits. Here, we discuss the available chemoprevention regimens for patients with HRLs and considerations for selecting a regimen, as well as the decision making surrounding use of adjuvant endocrine therapy for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). For patients with HRLs, available chemoprevention regimens differ by menopausal status, including tamoxifen 20 mg once daily for 5 years and more recently tamoxifen 5 mg once daily for 3 years in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women as well as raloxifene or aromatase inhibitors for postmenopausal women. We recommend a shared decision-making approach with attention to patient preferences related to risk tolerance and side-effect profiles. Low-dose tamoxifen appears to be a particularly favorable choice that is well tolerated, without risk of serious adverse events and offers comparable risk reduction to other regimens. For DCIS, the benefit of endocrine therapy in addition to radiation is small, and appears to be driven mainly by a reduction in contralateral breast diagnoses or new breast cancers. A strategy that reduces the side-effect profile of chemoprevention such as low-dose tamoxifen may be especially appealing in the setting of secondary prevention.",0
What Do Patients Look for When Scheduling Their Initial Elective Aesthetic Plastic Surgery Consultation?,"BACKGROUND: Multiple factors influence patients when deciding on where to seek plastic surgery consultations. Our objective was to determine the most important factors when booking the initial consultation. METHODS: A 23 question survey was distributed online via Amazon Mechanical Turk targeting participants who had prior plastic surgery consultations or were planning to have one in the future. Participant demographic data were collected, and participants were asked to rank the importance of factors related to cost, surgeon reputation, social media, technology, amenities, accessibility, and appointment details on a 1-5 Likert scale. Rankings were reported by mean and standard deviation. RESULTS: A total of 593 responses were gathered. 48.1% of participants were 25-34 years of age, 54.6% were female, 66.3% identified as White, 78.4% were located in the U.S, and 54.5% had a bachelor's degree. Participants rated the importance of a surgeon's online reviews (mean 4.15, SD 0.81), surgeon presence at follow-up visits (mean 4.01, SD 0.91), and availability of pricing prior to appointment (mean 4.01, SD 0.91) the highest. The least important factors were waiting room amenities and social media advertising. Individuals younger than 45 were more likely to rate a surgeon's social media presence higher than those 45 years and older (OR 2.02; 95%CI [1.37-2.96]; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients considered surgeon's online reviews, presence at follow-up visits, and the availability of pricing information the most important when booking a plastic surgery consultation. These findings may assist physicians in structuring plastic surgery consultations based on factors important to patients.

Fostering Patient-Centered Equitable Care in Radiology: AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review.,"Patient-centered care (PCC) and equity are two of the six core domains of quality health care, according to the Institute of Medicine. Exceptional imaging care requires radiology practices to provide patient-centered (i.e., respectful and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values) and equitable (i.e., does not vary in quality on the basis of gender, ethnicity, geographic location, or socioeconomic status) care. Specific barriers that prevent the delivery of patient-centered equitable care include information gaps, breaches of trust, organizational medical culture, and financial incentives. Information gaps limit practitioners in understanding the lived experience of patients. Breaches of trust prevent patients from seeking needed medical care. Organizational medical cultures may not be centered around patient experiences. Financial incentives can impede practitioners' ability to spend the time and resources required to meet patient goals and needs. Intentional approaches that integrate core principles in both PCC and health equity are required to deliver high-quality patient-centered imaging care for diverse patient populations. The purpose of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to review the origins of the PCC movement in radiology, characterize connections between the PCC and health equity movements, and describe concrete examples of ways to foster patient-centered equitable care in radiology.",0
"Management of valvular heart disease in patients with cancer: Multidisciplinary team, cancer-therapy related cardiotoxicity, diagnosis, transcatheter intervention, and cardiac surgery. Expert opinion of the Association on Valvular Heart Disease, Associati","The Association on Valvular Heart Disease, Association of Cardiovascular Interventions, and the Working Group on CardiacSurgery of the Polish Cardiac Society have released a position statement on risk factors, diagnosis, and management of patients with cancer and valvular heart disease (VHD). VHD can occur in patients with cancer in several ways, for example, it can exist or be diagnosed before cancer treatment, after cancer treatment, be an incidental finding during imaging tests, endocarditis related to immunosuppression, prolonged intravenous catheter use, or combination treatment, and nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. It is recommended to employ close cardiac surveillance for patients at high risk of complications during and after cancer treatment and for cancer treatments that may be cardiotoxic to be discussed by a multidisciplinary team. Patients with cancer and pre-existing severe VHD should be managed according to the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) guidelines for VHD management, taking into consideration cancer prognosis and patient preferences.",0
The Impact of Socioeconomic Status on the Presence of Advance Care Planning Documents in Patients With Acute Cervical Spinal Cord Injury.,"INTRODUCTION: Patients presenting with spinal cord injury (SCI) often times have notable deficits or polytrauma and may require urgent decision making for early management. However, their presentation may affect decision-making ability. Although advance care planning (ACP) may help guide spine surgeons as to patient preferences, the rate at which they are available and disparities in ACP completion are still not understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate disparities in the completion of ACP among patients with acute SCI. METHODS: All patients presenting with cervical SCI to the emergency department at an urban, tertiary level I trauma center from 2010 to 2021 were identified from a prospective database of all consults evaluated by the spine service. Each patient's medical record was reviewed to assess for the presence of ACP documents such as living will, power of attorney, or advance directive. Community-level socioeconomic status was assessed using the Distressed Communities Index. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed. RESULTS: We identified 424 patients: 104 (24.5%) of whom had ACP. Patients with ACP were older (64.8 versus 56.5 years, P = 0.001), more likely White (78.8% versus 71.9%, P = 0.057), and present with ASIA Impairment Scale grade A SCI (21.2% versus 12.8%, P = 0.054), although the latter two did not reach statistical significance. On multivariable logistic regression, patients residing in at-risk communities were significantly less likely to have ACP documents compared with those in prosperous communities (odds ratio [OR]: 0.29, P = 0.03). Although patients living in distressed communities were less likely to complete ACP compared with those in prosperous communities (OR 0.50, P = 0.066), this did not meet statistical significance. Female patients were also less likely to have ACP (OR: 0.43, P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Female patients and those from at-risk communities are markedly less likely to complete ACP. Attention to possible disparities during admission and ACP discussions may help ensure that patients of all backgrounds have treatment goals documented.",0
Survival Outcomes in Older Women with Oestrogen-Receptor-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Primary Endocrine Therapy vs. Surgery by Comorbidity and Frailty Levels.,"Primary endocrine therapy (PET) offers non-surgical treatment for older women with early-stage breast cancer who are unsuitable for surgery due to frailty or comorbidity. This research assessed all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality of PET vs. surgery in older women (≥70 years) with oestrogen-receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer by frailty and comorbidity levels. This study used UK secondary data to analyse older female patients from 2000 to 2016. Patients were censored until 31 May 2019 and grouped by the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and hospital frailty risk score (HFRS). Cox regression models compared all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality between PET and surgery within each group, adjusting for patient preferences and covariates. Sensitivity analyses accounted for competing risks. There were 23,109 patients included. The hazard ratio (HR) comparing PET to surgery for overall survival decreased significantly from 2.1 (95%CI: 2.0, 2.2) to 1.2 (95%CI: 1.1, 1.5) with increasing HFRS and from 2.1 (95%CI: 2.0, 2.2) to 1.4 (95%CI 1.2, 1.7) with rising CCI. However, there was no difference in BCSM for frail older women (HR: 1.2; 0.9, 1.9). There were no differences in competing risk profiles between other causes of death and breast cancer-specific mortality with PET versus surgery, with a subdistribution hazard ratio of 1.1 (0.9, 1.4) for high-level HFRS (p = 0.261) and CCI (p = 0.093). Given limited survival gains from surgery for older patients, PET shows potential as an effective option for frail older women with early-stage breast cancer. Despite surgery outperforming PET, surgery loses its edge as frailty increases, with negligible differences in the very frail.",0
Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Absorbable and Nonabsorbable Sutures in A1 Pulley Release.,"BACKGROUND: Both absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures are used to correct palmar incisions or lacerations. Nonabsorbable sutures have been used without complications but require removal at a follow-up appointment. Alternatively, the use of absorbable sutures has increased in popularity as postoperative suture removal is not required but is associated with local immunological and inflammatory responses. In this study, we compared the scar quality and outcomes of nonabsorbable and absorbable sutures in A1 pulley release. METHODS: Patients who underwent A1 pulley release were randomized to 1 of 2 suture materials. The Patient Scar Assessment Scale, Observer Scar Assessment Scale, Visual Analogue Scale, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores were collected at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Among the 41 patients included in the study, 23 were randomized to the nonabsorbable suture group, and 18 to the absorbable suture group. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two suture groups in the aforementioned assessments. Complication rates were higher in the nonabsorbable suture group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Notably, 1 case in the absorbable suture group had uncontrolled postoperative bleeding and required reoperation. CONCLUSION: We found no significant difference between the two materials in terms of the Patient or Observer Scar Assessment Scales, overall complication rates, symptom scores, or pain scores. Therefore, the choice using absorbable or nonabsorbable can be guided by other factors such as physician or patient preference, availability, and cost.",0
Healthcare Provider Administration of Biologics for Patients with Plaque Psoriasis: Literature Review and Clinical Considerations.,"OBJECTIVE: Plaque psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, immune-mediated skin disease. Biologic therapies markedly improve skin disease severity and health-related quality of life for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. All but two of the biologics approved in the United States for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis may be self-administered by adult patients via subcutaneous injection. This review discusses rationales for choosing healthcare provider (HCP) administration over self-administration of biologics for patients with plaque psoriasis, including treatment adherence, patient preference, and practical considerations. METHODS: PubMed was searched for ""psoriasisAND biologic AND administration AND (office OR provider OR profession)."" The most relevant results and additional papers identified from the references were included in the review. RESULTS: Although many patients prefer self-administration, others may benefit from HCP administration. Key considerations in the choice between HCP vs. self-administration of biologics for plaque psoriasis treatment include adherence, patient preferences, and practical concerns. Patient characteristics that may make HCP administration of biologic therapies for treatment of plaque psoriasis preferable to at-home self-administration are discussed. LIMITATIONS: There are few published studies specific to HCP administration of biologics for treatment of psoriasis. CONCLUSION: Administration of biologics by an HCP may improve treatment adherence and clinical outcomes compared to self-administration in selected patients with plaque psoriasis.",0
"The perspective of Polish patients with rheumatoid arthritis - treatment expectations, patient-reported outcomes, and digital literacy (the SENSE study).","INTRODUCTION: A widely accepted treat-to-target strategy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) requires the patient's perspective in making treatment decisions. However, data on treatment preferences and expectations of Polish patients with RA are scarce. The aim of the study was to determine the satisfaction with treatment and the nature of therapeutic preferences and expectations of Polish patients with moderate to severe RA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-two adult Polish patients with moderately to highly active RA were asked to complete patient-reported outcomes and patient-provided information questionnaires. Additionally, patient sociodemographic and clinical data and information on patient current and planned treatment strategies were collected. RESULTS: The mean global assessment of patient satisfaction with treatment was 64.1 ±24.6, below the level of indicating satisfaction. Rheumatoid arthritis negatively impacted patients' lives, resulting in a 37.8% impairment of work efficiency and 45% impairment of total activity. Primary treatment expectations for patients were lasting relief of RA symptoms, reduced pain and swelling in joints, increased flexibility of joints, and general improvement of arthritis. The most acceptable potential side effect was weight gain and the least acceptable were increases in the risk of cardiovascular disease, infection, and malignancies. The rapid onset of the drug effect (up to 1 week) was a preference of 48.1% of patients. Access to internet health resources was important for 44.2% of patients, but the median total eHealth literacy score in the study population was 24.0 (interquartile range: 20.5-28.0, range 8-37), which means low digital health literacy (DHL). CONCLUSIONS: Understanding these treatment preferences and expectations of patients with RA is essential for clinical practitioners to facilitate shared treatment decision-making. Digital health literacy data suggest the need of further improvement.",0
Patients' perspectives on the relevance of biosimilars' outcomes in oncology: qualitative study with nominal group technique.,"PURPOSE: We aimed to rate the importance of outcomes from a systematic review about biosimilars in oncology from patients' perspective. METHODS: This is a qualitative research with nominal group technique. Patients with cancer were selected by convenience sampling and invited for two mediated virtual meetings in 2022. Twelve outcomes from a systematic review on biosimilars for oncology developed following a protocol were explained in plain language to participants who classified them as critical, important, or not important according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. We employed Iramuteq software for lexical categorization of the meeting transcripts, and content analysis for interpretation. RESULTS: Five women participated (three had metastatic cancer, one non-metastatic, one recurrent). Six outcomes were classified as critical: duration of response, progression-free survival, pathological complete response, overall survival, severe adverse events, and quality of life; three as important: mortality, event-free survival, and objective response; and three as non-important: neutralizing anti-drug antibody, any adverse event, and non-neutralizing anti-drug antibody. Duration of response, pathological complete response, severe adverse events, and quality of life were considered secondary in the review protocol, but critical by the patients. The main themes influencing the importance classification were related to the disease (progression and control) and treatment (recognition and healthcare setting). CONCLUSION: Patients rated most outcomes as critical or important, some of them previously regarded as secondary by the researchers, which reinforces the need to include stakeholders' perspectives in oncology research. Aspects of the disease progression and treatment effects influenced participants' judgment on outcomes' relevance.",0
"Local versus General Anaesthesia for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI): A Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and Trial Sequential Analysis of Randomised and Propensity-Score Matched Studies.","Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a common practice for severe aortic stenosis, but the choice between general (GA) and local anesthesia (LA) remains uncertain. We conducted a comprehensive literature review until April 2023, comparing the safety and efficacy of LA versus GA in TAVI procedures. Our findings indicate significant advantages of LA, including lower 30-day mortality rates (RR: 0.69; 95% CI [0.58, 0.82]; p < 0.001), shorter in-hospital stays (mean difference: -0.91 days; 95% CI [-1.63, -0.20]; p = 0.01), reduced bleeding/transfusion incidents (RR: 0.64; 95% CI [0.48, 0.85]; p < 0.01), and fewer respiratory complications (RR: 0.56; 95% CI [0.42, 0.76], p<0.01). Other operative outcomes were comparable. Our findings reinforce prior evidence, presenting a compelling case for LA's safety and efficacy. While patient preferences and clinical nuances must be considered, our study propels the discourse towards a more informed anaesthesia approach for TAVI procedures.",0

Very early medical abortion: treatment with mifepristone and misoprostol before ultrasonographic visualisation of an intrauterine pregnancy.,"INTRODUCTION: Abortion providers may be reluctant to commence abortion before ultrasound evidence of intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) due to concerns of missed ectopic pregnancy. In 2017, very early medical abortion (VEMA) was introduced at an abortion service in Edinburgh, UK. Following ultrasound, patients without confirmed IUP, and without symptoms or risk factors for ectopic pregnancy, could commence treatment immediately after baseline serum-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) measurement, and return for follow-up serum-hCG a week later to determine treatment success (≥80% decline from baseline). This study aimed to compare clinical outcomes between two pathways: (1) VEMA; and (2) standard-of-care delayed treatment where treatment is only commenced on IUP confirmation by serial serum-hCG monitoring and/or repeat ultrasound. METHODS: A retrospective database review was conducted of VEMA eligible patients from July 2017 to December 2021. Study groups were determined by patient preference. Records were searched for abortion outcomes, duration of care, number of appointments (clinic visits, ultrasounds, serum-hCG) and clinical data entries. RESULTS: Of 181 patients included, 77 (43%) chose VEMA and 104 (57%) chose delayed treatment. 11/181 (6.1%) were lost to follow-up. Cohort ectopic prevalence was 4.4% and was not statistically different between groups (2.6% vs 5.8%, VEMA vs delayed group, respectively, p=0.305), as with complete abortion rates (93.3% vs 97.6%, p=0.256). All VEMA group ectopics were detected on the seventh day (from initial visit) while time-to-diagnosis for delayed group ectopics ranged from 7 days to 3 weeks. VEMA patients had significantly reduced duration of care (12 vs 21 days, p<0.001), number of visits (2 vs 3, p<0.001), ultrasounds (1 vs 2, p<0.001) and data entries (6 vs 9, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: VEMA is safe, effective and reduces the duration of care, number of appointments and clinical administrative time. It should be offered to medically eligible patients.",0
Inter-hospital Transfer Decision-making During the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Qualitative Study.,"BACKGROUND: Inter-hospital patient transfers to hospitals with greater resource availability and expertise may improve clinical outcomes. However, there is little guidance regarding how patient transfer requests should be prioritized when hospital resources become scarce. OBJECTIVE: To understand the experiences of healthcare workers involved in the process of accepting inter-hospital patient transfers during a pandemic surge and determine factors impacting inter-hospital patient transfer decision-making. DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative study consisting of semi-structured interviews between October 2021 and February 2022. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible participants were physicians, nurses, and non-clinician administrators involved in the process of accepting inter-hospital patient transfers. Participants were recruited using maximum variation sampling. APPROACH: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with healthcare workers across Michigan. KEY RESULTS: Twenty-one participants from 15 hospitals were interviewed (45.5% of eligible hospitals). About half (52.4%) of participants were physicians, 38.1% were nurses, and 9.5% were non-clinician administrators. Three domains of themes impacting patient transfer decision-making emerged: decision-maker, patient, and environmental factors. Decision-makers described a lack of guidance for transfer decision-making. Patient factors included severity of illness, predicted chance of survival, need for specialized care, and patient preferences for medical care. Decision-making occurred within the context of environmental factors including scarce resources at accepting and requesting hospitals, organizational changes to transfer processes, and alternatives to patient transfer including use of virtual care. Participants described substantial moral distress related to transfer triaging. CONCLUSIONS: A lack of guidance in transfer processes may result in considerable variation in the patients who are accepted for inter-hospital transfer and in substantial moral distress among decision-makers involved in the transfer process. Our findings identify potential organizational changes to improve the inter-hospital transfer process and alleviate the moral distress experienced by decision-makers.",0
A discrete choice experiment to understand public preferences and priorities for risk-stratified bowel cancer screening programmes in the UK.,"OBJECTIVE: Public acceptability of bowel cancer screening programmes must be maintained, including if risk stratification is introduced. We aimed to describe and quantify preferences for different attributes of risk-stratified screening programmes amongst the UK population, focussing on who to invite for bowel screening. METHODS: We conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) including the following attributes: risk factors used to estimate bowel cancer risk (age plus/minus sex, lifestyle factors and genetics); personalisation of risk feedback; risk stratification strategy plus resource implications; default screening in the case of no risk information; number of deaths prevented by screening; and number experiencing physical harm from screening. We used the results of conditional logit regression models to estimate the importance of each attribute, willingness to trade-off between the attributes, and preferences for different programmes using contemporary risk scores and models. RESULTS: 1196 respondents completed the survey, generating 21,528 DCE observations. Deaths prevented was the most influential attribute on respondents' decision-making (contributing to 58.8% of the choice), followed by harms experienced (15.9%). For every three additional deaths prevented, respondents were willing to accept an additional screening harm per 100,000 people. Risk factors and risk stratification strategy contributed to just 11.1% and 3.6% of the choice, respectively. Although the influence on decision-making was small, respondents favoured more personalised feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Bowel cancer screening programmes that improve cancer outcomes, particularly by preventing more deaths amongst those screened, are most preferred by the public. Optimising risk prediction models, developing public communication, and readying infrastructure should be prioritised for implementation.",1
Design and Material Characterization of an Inflatable Vaginal Dilator.,"There are more than 13,000 new cases of cervical cancer each year in the United States and approximately 245,000 survivors. External beam radiation and brachytherapy are the front-line treatment modalities, and 60% of patients develop vaginal damage and constriction, i.e., stenosis of the vaginal vault, greatly impeding sexual function. The incidence of vaginal stenosis (VS) following radiotherapy (RT) for anorectal cancer is 80%. VS causes serious quality of life (QoL) and psychological issues, and while standard treatment using self-administered plastic dilators is effective, acceptance and compliance are often insufficient. Based on published patient preferences, we have pursued the design of a soft inflatable dilator for treating radiotherapy-induced vaginal stenosis (VS). The critical component of the novel device is the dilator balloon wall material, which must be compliant yet able to exert therapeutic lateral force levels. We selected a commercially available silicone elastomer and characterized its stress-strain characteristics and hyperelastic properties. These parameters were quantified using uniaxial tensile testing and digital image correlation (DIC). Dilator inflation versus internal pressure was modeled and experimentally validated in order to characterize design parameters, particularly the dilator wall thickness. Our data suggest that an inflatable silicone elastomer-based vaginal dilator warrants further development in the context of a commercially available, well-tolerated, and effective device for the graded, controlled clinical management of radiotherapy-induced VS.",0
Patient preferences and willingness to pay for central venous access devices in breast cancer: A multicenter discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Despite being a significant management decision in clinical or nursing practice, there is limited understanding of the preferences regarding risks, benefits, costs, and other attributes of patients with breast cancer when selecting peripherally inserted central catheters or totally implanted ports. The objective of this study is to investigate the preferences of patients with breast cancer who require chemotherapy when selecting an optimal central venous access device. METHODS: Data on patients' preferences for central venous access devices were collected using a face-to-face discrete choice experiment from the oncology departments of three public hospitals in China representing the eastern (Zhejiang province), central (Henan province), and western (Sichuan province) regions. The study used six attributes to describe the preferences of breast cancer patients for central venous access devices, including out-of-pocket cost, limitations in activities of daily living, catheter maintenance frequency, risk of catheter-related thrombosis, risk of catheter-related infection, and size of incision. Data were analyzed using a conditional logit model and mixed logit model. The marginal willingness to pay (mWTP) was calculated by assessing the ratio of the preference for other attributes to the preference for out-of-pocket cost. RESULTS: A total of 573 respondents completed the survey. The discrete choice experiment results showed that respondents strongly preferred a central venous access device with a catheter maintenance frequency of one time a month (vs four times a month, β = 1.188, p < 0.001), the lower risk of catheter-related thrombosis (2 % vs 10 %, β = 1.068; p < 0.001) and lower risk of catheter-related infection (2 % vs 8 % risk: β = 0.824; p < 0.001). Respondents were willing to pay CNY ¥11,968.1 (US$1776.5) for a central venous access device with a catheter maintenance frequency of one time a month rather than four times a month, ¥10,753.6 (US$1596.2) for a central venous access device with 2 % thrombosis risk over one with 10 %, and ¥8302.0 (US$1232.3) for a central venous access device with 2 % infection risk over one with 8 %. Respondents with longer travel time to the hospital, younger than 50 years old, and with urban employee basic medical insurance were willing to pay more for an improvement in the attributes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that patients with breast cancer were mainly concerned with the out-of-pocket cost, catheter maintenance frequency, risk of catheter-related thrombosis and risk of catheter-related infection when choosing a central venous access device for the delivery of chemotherapy. In clinical or nursing practice, when making central venous access device recommendation for young patients and those who live far from hospitals, totally implanted ports may be a preferable choice.",1
Colposcopy in the Primary Health Care: A Scoping Review.,"AIM: Low- and middle-income countries represent nearly 85% of all cervical cancer cases worldwide; thereby, it is extremely important to identify methods to improve the screening process. Therefore, this study aimed to summarize the primary characteristics of studies on accessibility, coverage, patient preferences, and factors associated with patient satisfaction or acceptance of colposcopy in primary healthcare. METHODS: A search strategy, based on MeSH, Emtree, and free terms, was run through 5 databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Ovid/Medline, and Web of Science). EndNote 20.1 © and Rayyan QCRI © were used for screening. A preset datasheet was used for data extraction. RESULTS: The systematic search retrieved 1127 references, and after removing duplicates, screening the titles and abstracts, and reviewing the full text, 7 studies were included. The interrater reliability was 77.73% (kappa statistic = 0.1842). Most studies estimated the proportion of women that sought for colposcopy after a previous screening test for human papilloma virus. One study identifies barriers to colposcopy examination in women at risk of developing cervical cancer. Three studies assessed the decentralization of colposcopy from a tertiary healthcare center to a primary care center. Pap smear was the most common first-line screening test, followed by liquid-based cytology sample and visual inspection with acetic acid. CONCLUSION: Only a few countries have investigated the use of colposcopy in primary care. Thus, barriers and the care structure for this implementation to be successful in reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality should be identified.",0
Patient Perception of Physician Attire Before and After the COVID-19 Global Pandemic Began.,"Introduction: This study evaluated patient preference of physician attire both before and after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic began. The primary outcome was patient preference of physician attire in 2017 compared to 2022 survey cohorts. Methods: An observational cross-sectional study performed at a single-site academic institution in the United States using patient survey materials. In total, 339 patients were included in the study, 161 from 2017 and 178 from 2022. Key Points: There was a statistically significant decrease in patient preference for formal attire in the clinical settings of primary care, hospital, and overall. Male patient preference for formal attire declined in primary care, emergency room, and overall; whereas female patient preference for formal attire declined in the hospital setting. For all genders, the odds ratio was statistically significantly lower in the settings of primary care clinic, hospital, and overall clinical settings. Conclusions: Patient preference for physicians wearing formal attire has decreased significantly since the COVID-19 global pandemic began.",0
Sentiment analysis of pain physician reviews on Healthgrades: a physician review website.,"INTRODUCTION: There are currently no published studies using patient reviews of pain physicians to quantitatively assess patient preferences for pain physician attributes. The aim of the present study was to use natural language processing to quantitatively analyze patient reviews of pain physicians by determining the effect of physician demographics and word frequency on positive review outcomes. METHODS: Using a peer-reviewed algorithm, online Healthgrades reviews of pain physicians practicing in the USA were scored according to their positive sentiment from -1 to 1. These sentiment scores and star ratings were used to compare physicians by age, gender and region of practice. Frequency analysis of words and bigrams was performed for all reviews. RESULTS: There were 15 101 reviews collected among 1275 pain physicians which showed male physicians received higher star ratings and review sentiment scores than female physicians. Pain physicians younger than 55 years received higher star ratings and sentiment scores than those of 55 years and older. Frequency analysis revealed that words most commonly used in the more positive patient reviews included 'care', 'professional', 'patient', 'help' and 'kind'; the words most commonly used in less positive reviews included 'pain', 'back', 'office', 'time' and 'years'. CONCLUSIONS: Male and/or younger pain physicians receive more positive reviews. Patients highly rate pain physicians who are perceived as personable. Patients lowly rate physicians who are perceived as providing ineffective treatment of their pain as well as when they experience barriers to their access to care.",0
"Changes in thyroid function in prostate cancer patients receiving docetaxel chemotherapy at Haji Adam Malik Hospital, Indonesia.","BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer treatment is determined based on several factors, namely tumor grading, staging, co-morbidity, patient preferences, life expectancy at diagnosis. Today, taxanes are commonly prescribed to treat several types of cancer and have been shown to have antitumor effects in many cancers. This research has never been done in prostate cancer patients but similar studies have been done before in breast cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The research design was observational analytic where this type of research was a prospective cohort where data was collected to record prostate cancer patients who received docetaxel chemotherapy which were then examined for thyroid function in cancer patients at the Adam Malik Hospital, Medan, Indonesia. RESULT: In this study, data were collected regarding the thyroid function of the study sample in the form of free thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels before chemotherapy with the docetaxel regimen. The mean of fT4 in all research subjects was 1.05 with a standard deviation of 0.26. The mean TSH in all study subjects was 1.52 with a standard deviation of 1.21. Thyroid function was examined after 3 cycles of docetaxel chemotherapy. The mean of fT4 in all research subjects was 0.91 with a standard deviation of 0.23. The mean TSH in all study subjects was 1.69 with a standard deviation of 1.09. CONCLUSION: There are traces of the use of docetaxel chemotherapy in prostate cancer patients on decreased thyroid function at the Adam Malik Hospital in the form of decreased fT4 levels and increased TSH.",0
Shared Decision-Making in Allergen Immunotherapy (AIT) Options Using a Questionnaire for Respiratory Allergic Patients: A Delphi Consensus Study.,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to develop and validate a questionnaire, through a Delphi consensus, to be used by allergists in their routine clinical practice to assess the preferences of patients starting allergen immunotherapy (AIT) treatment using an objective approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Delphi consensus-driven process was used. The scientific committee, composed of 15 allergists, led the study and participated in the preparation of the questionnaire. Two-hundred panelists from different Spanish regions were invited to complete a 16-item questionnaire on a nine-point Likert scale covering six topic blocks. Consensus was achieved if ≥66.6% of panelists reached agreement or disagreement. RESULTS: Of the 200 experts invited to participate in the Delphi process, a total of 195 (97.5%) answered the questionnaire. The panel experts reached a consensus on ""agreement"" on a total of 12 of the 16 (75.0%) items, covering a total of six categories: (a) patient knowledge (2 questions), (b) barriers to patient adherence (3 questions), (c) patient behavior (4 questions), (d) future actions (3 questions), (e) treatment costs (2 questions), and (f) final patient preferences (2 questions). CONCLUSION: This Delphi consensus study validated a set of twelve recommended questions for patients objectively assessing their preferences and suitability for the most common AIT options available. The questionnaire intends to assist allergists in making an objective, unconditioned decision regarding the best AIT option for each patient, after informing them about the different routes.",0
Heterogeneity in management of category II fetal tracings: data from a multihospital healthcare system.,"BACKGROUND: Electronic fetal monitoring is widely used to identify and intervene in suspected fetal hypoxia and/or acidemia. Category II fetal heart rate tracings are the most common class of fetal monitoring in labor, and intrauterine resuscitation is recommended given the association of category II fetal heart rate tracings with fetal acidemia. However, limited published data are available to guide intrauterine resuscitation technique selection, leading to heterogeneity in the response to category II fetal heart rate tracings. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize approaches to intrauterine resuscitation in response to category II fetal heart rate tracings. STUDY DESIGN: This was a survey study administered to labor unit nurses and delivering clinicians (physicians and midwives) across 7 hospitals in a Midwestern healthcare system spanning 2 states. The survey posed 3 category II fetal heart rate tracing scenarios (recurrent late decelerations, minimal variability, and recurrent variable decelerations) and asked participants to select first- and second-line intrauterine resuscitation management strategies. The participants were asked to quantify the level of influence certain factors have on their choice using a scale from 1 to 5. Intrauterine resuscitation strategy selection was compared by clinical role and hospital type (nurses vs delivering clinicians and university-affiliated hospital vs non-university-affiliated hospital). RESULTS: Of 610 providers invited to take the survey, 163 participated (response rate of 27%): 37% of participants from university-affiliated hospitals, 62% of nurses, and 37% of physicians. Maternal repositioning was the most selected first-line strategy, regardless of the type of category II fetal heart rate tracing. First-line management varied by clinical role and hospital affiliation for each fetal heart rate tracing scenario, particularly for minimal variability, which was associated with the most heterogeneity in the first-line approach. Previous experience and recommendations from professional societies were the most influential factors in intrauterine resuscitation selection overall. Of note, 16.5% of participants reported that published evidence did not influence their choice at all. Participants from a university-affiliated hospital were more likely than participants from a non-university-affiliated hospital to consider patient preference when selecting an intrauterine resuscitation technique. Nurses and delivering clinicians differed significantly in the rationale for management choices: nurses were more often influenced by advice from other healthcare providers on the team (P<.001), whereas delivering clinicians were more influenced by literature (P=.02) and ease of technique (P=.02). CONCLUSION: There was significant heterogeneity in the management of category II fetal heart rate tracing. In addition, motivations for choice in intrauterine resuscitation technique varied by hospital type and clinical role. These factors should be considered when creating fetal monitoring and intrauterine resuscitation protocols.",0
Patient preferences for features of HER2-targeted treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer: a discrete-choice experiment study.,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to quantify patients' benefit-risk preferences for attributes associated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted breast cancer treatments and estimate minimum acceptable benefits (MABs), denominated in additional months of progression-free survival (PFS), for given treatment-related adverse events (AEs). METHODS: We conducted an online discrete-choice experiment (DCE) among patients with self-reported advanced/metastatic breast cancer in the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan (N = 302). In a series of nine DCE questions, respondents chose between two hypothetical treatment profiles created by an experimental design. Profiles were defined by six attributes with varying levels: PFS, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, liver function problems, risk of heart failure, and risk of serious lung damage and infections. Data were analyzed using an error component random-parameters logit model. RESULTS: Among the attributes, patients placed the most importance on a change in PFS from 5 to 26 months; change from no diarrhea to severe diarrhea was the least important. Avoiding a 15% risk of heart failure had the largest MAB (5.8 additional months of PFS), followed by avoiding a 15% risk of serious lung damage and infections (4.6 months), possible severe liver function problems (4.2 months), severe nausea/vomiting (3.7 months), and severe diarrhea (2.3 months) compared with having none of the AEs. The relative importance of 21 additional months of PFS (increasing from 5 to 26 months) increased for women with HER2-negative disease and those with children. CONCLUSIONS: Patients valued PFS gain higher than the potential risk of AEs when deciding between hypothetical breast cancer treatments.",1
Understanding Treatment Preferences for Patients with Tricuspid Regurgitation.,"Background. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a high-prevalence disease associated with poor quality of life and mortality. This quantitative patient preference study aims to identify TR patients' perspectives on risk-benefit tradeoffs. Methods. A discrete-choice experiment was developed to explore TR treatment risk-benefit tradeoffs. Attributes (levels) tested were treatment (procedure, medical management), reintervention risk (0%, 1%, 5%, 10%), medications over 2 y (none, reduce, same, increase), shortness of breath (none/mild, moderate, severe), and swelling (never, 3× per week, daily). A mixed logit regression model estimated preferences and calculated predicted probabilities. Relative attribute importance was calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed. Results. An online survey was completed by 150 TR patients. Shortness of breath was the most important attribute and accounted for 65.8% of treatment decision making. The average patients' predicted probability of preferring a ""procedure-like"" profile over a ""medical management-like"" profile was 99.7%. This decreased to 78.9% for a level change from severe to moderate in shortness of breath in the ""medical management-like"" profile. Subgroup analysis confirmed that patients older than 64 y had a stronger preference to avoid severe shortness of breath compared with younger patients (P < 0.02), as did severe or worse TR patients relative to moderate. New York Heart Association class I/II patients more strongly preferred to avoid procedural reintervention risk relative to class III/IV patients (P < 0.03). Conclusion. TR patients are willing to accept higher procedural reintervention risk if shortness of breath is alleviated. This risk tolerance is higher for older and more symptomatic patients. These results emphasize the appropriateness of developing TR therapies and the importance of addressing symptom burden. HIGHLIGHTS: This study provides quantitative patient preference data from clinically confirmed tricuspid regurgitation (TR) patients to understand their treatment preferences.Using a targeted literature search and patient, physician, and Food and Drug Administration feedback, a cross-sectional survey with a discrete-choice experiment that focused on 5 of the most important attributes to TR patients was developed and administered online.TR patients are willing to accept higher procedural reintervention risk if shortness of breath is alleviated, and this risk tolerance is higher for older and more symptomatic patients.",1
Early Versus Delayed Oral Anticoagulation in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke Due to Atrial Fibrillation: A Meta-Analysis.,"The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of early oral anticoagulation with delayed anticoagulant therapy in patients who have had a recent stroke and have atrial fibrillation (AF). This meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. The literature search was independently performed by two authors. We searched PubMed and Scopus using search strings that included the following terms: ""stroke,"" ""atrial fibrillation,"" ""oral anticoagulants,"" ""recurrent stroke,"" and ""intracerebral hemorrhage."" Our search spanned from the inception of databases to May 25, 2023. The primary outcome assessed in this study was the composite efficacy outcome (as defined by individual studies). Recurrent ischemic stroke (IS), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and death from any cause were assessed as secondary outcomes. For safety analysis, bleeding events were compared between the two study groups. We included five articles in this meta-analysis, comprising a total of 7958 patients (including 3793 in the early treatment group and 4165 in the delayed treatment group). Pooled analysis showed that the risk of composite efficacy outcome (RR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.51-0.93, p-value: 0.01) and recurrent ischemic stroke (RR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.53-0.94, p-value: 0.02) were lower in the early treatment group. However, no significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of all-cause mortality, intracranial hemorrhage, or bleeding events. In light of the findings, healthcare professionals should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of early versus delayed DOAC treatment in individual patients, considering factors such as stroke severity, bleeding risk, and patient preferences.",0
Managing Psoriatic Arthritis Patients Presenting with Axial Symptoms.,"Axial symptoms (i.e., back pain) are common in the general population. At the same time 25-70% of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) exhibit signs of inflammatory axial involvement (axial PsA). The presence of unexplained chronic (duration ≥ 3 months) back pain in a patient with psoriasis or PsA should trigger evaluation of the presence of axial involvement. Evaluation of axial involvement normally involves imaging of the axial skeleton (sacroiliac joints and/or spine) in addition to clinical and laboratory evaluation. Symptomatic patients with confirmed axial PsA are treated with a combination of non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic methods including the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tumour necrosis factor, interleukin 17, and Janus kinase inhibitors. Interleukin 23 blockade might also be effective in the axial domain of PsA; a dedicated clinical study is ongoing at present. Safety considerations, patient preference, as well as the presence of other disease manifestations (especially of extra-musculoskeletal manifestations-clinically relevant psoriasis, acute anterior uveitis, inflammatory bowel disease), define the choice of a specific drug or drug class.",0
Optimizing the Management Algorithm for Heartburn in General Gastroenterology: Cost-Effectiveness and Cost-Minimization Analysis.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Heartburn is the most common symptom seen in gastroenterology practice. We aimed to optimize cost-effective evaluation and management of heartburn. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model from insurer and patient perspectives comparing 4 strategies for patients failing empiric proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): (1) PPI optimization without testing, (2) endoscopy with PPI optimization for all patients, (3) endoscopy with PPI discontinuation when erosive findings are absent, and (4) endoscopy/ambulatory reflux monitoring with PPI discontinuation as appropriate for phenotypic management. Health outcomes were respectively defined on systematic reviews of clinical trials. Cost outcomes were defined on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services databases and commercial multipliers for direct healthcare costs, and national observational studies evaluating healthcare utilization. The time horizon was 1 year. All testing was performed off PPI. RESULTS: PPI optimization without testing cost $3784/y to insurers and $3128 to patients due to lower work productivity and suboptimal symptom relief. Endoscopy with PPI optimization lowered insurer costs by $1020/y and added 11 healthy days/y by identifying erosive reflux disease. Endoscopy with PPI discontinuation added 11 additional healthy days/y by identifying patients without erosive reflux disease that did not need PPI. By optimizing phenotype-guided treatment, endoscopy/ambulatory reflux monitoring with a trial of PPI discontinuation was the most effective of all strategies (gaining 22 healthy days/y) and saved $2183 to insurers and $2396 to patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with heartburn, endoscopy with ambulatory reflux monitoring (off PPI) optimizes cost-effective management by matching treatment to phenotype. When erosive findings are absent, trialing PPI discontinuation is more cost-effective than optimizing PPI.",0
Cultural influences on shared decision-making among Asian Americans: A systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies.,"OBJECTIVE: To summarize how Asian Americans negotiate involvement in shared decision-making (SDM) with their providers, the cultural influences on SDM, and perceived barriers and facilitators to SDM. METHODS: This is a systematic review of qualitative studies. We searched six electronic databases and sources of gray literature until March 2021. Two reviewers independently screened studies, performed quality appraisal, and data extraction. Meta-synthesis was performed to summarize themes using a three-step approach. RESULTS: Twenty studies with 675 participants were included. We abstracted 275 initial codes and grouped these into 19 subthemes and 4 major themes: (1) negotiating power and differing expectations in SDM; (2) cultural influences on SDM; (3) importance of social support in SDM; and (4) supportive factors for facilitating SDM. CONCLUSIONS: Asian Americans have important perspectives, needs, and preferences regarding SDM that impacts how they engage with the provider on medical decisions and their perception of the quality of their care. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Asian American patients valued good communication and sufficient time with their provider, and that it is important for health professionals to understand patients' desired level of involvement in the SDM process and in the final decision, and who should be involved in SDM beyond the patient. OTHER: This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021241665).",0
A 10-year follow-up of reproductive outcomes in women attempting motherhood after elective oocyte cryopreservation.,"STUDY QUESTION: Which reproductive treatment outcomes are observed in women who underwent elective oocyte cryopreservation (EOC) and who returned to the clinic with a desire for a child? SUMMARY ANSWER: Whether to warm oocytes or to first use fresh own oocytes for ART depends on age upon returning, but both strategies result in favorable reproductive outcomes. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Most affluent countries have observed a trend toward postponement of childbearing, and EOC is increasingly used based on the assumption that oocytes cryopreserved at a younger age may extend a woman's reproductive lifespan and mitigate her age-related fertility decline. Although most follow-up studies after EOC have focused on women who requested oocyte warming, a substantial proportion of women who do not conceive naturally will embark on fertility treatment without using their cryopreserved oocytes. Reports on reproductive outcomes in past EOC users are scarce, and the lack of reproductive treatment algorithms in this group of women hampers counseling toward the most efficient clinical strategy. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This retrospective observational single-center study encompasses 843 women who had elective oocyte vitrification between 2009 and 2019 at our fertility clinic. Women who underwent fertility preservation for medical or oncological reasons were excluded. This study describes the outcomes of the diverse reproductive treatment strategies performed until May 2022 in women returning to our clinic to attempt motherhood. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Using descriptive statistics, patient characteristics and data of ovarian stimulation (OS) of EOC cycles were analyzed, as well as data related to OS and laboratory data of ART in women who pursued fertility treatment with and/or without using their cryopreserved oocytes. The primary outcome was live birth rate (LBR) per patient after oocyte warming and after ART using fresh oocytes. Secondary outcomes were return rate, utilization rate of the cryopreserved oocytes, laboratory outcomes upon return, and LBR per embryo transfer. A multivariable regression model was developed to identify factors associated with the decision to thaw oocytes as the primary strategy and factors associated with ongoing pregnancy upon return to the clinic. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 1353 EOC cycles (mean ± SD, 1.6 ± 0.9 per patient) were performed. At the time of EOC, the mean age was 36.5 ± 2.8 years, mean anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) was 2.3 ± 2.0 ng/ml, and 174 (20.6%) women had a partner. On average, 13.9 ± 9.2 mature oocytes were cryopreserved. Two hundred thirty-one (27.4%) women returned to the clinic, an average of 39.9 ± 23.4 months after EOC. Upon returning, their mean age was 40.4 ± 3.1 years, mean AMH was 1.5 ± 1.5 ng/ml, and 158/231 (68.3%) patients had a partner. As a primary approach, 110/231 (47.6%) past EOC users embarked on oocyte warming, 50/231 (21.6%) had intrauterine insemination, and 71/231 (30.7%) had ART using fresh own oocytes. Cumulative LBR (CLBR) was 45.9% (106/231) notwithstanding a miscarriage rate (MR) of 30.7% (51/166) in the entire cohort. In total, 141 women performed oocyte warming at some stage in their treatment trajectory. A subset of 90/231 (39.0%) patients exclusively had oocyte warming (41.6 ± 3.0 years, with 10.0 ± 5.2 oocytes warmed per patient). 52/231 (22.5%) patients exclusively had ART using fresh own oocytes (mean age of 39.0 ± 2.8 years, with 9.9 ± 7.4 mature oocytes retrieved per patient). CLBR was 37/90 (41.1%) in the oocyte warming-only group and 25/52 (48.1%) in the OS-only group. MR/transfer was 25.0% and 29.3% in the oocyte warming-only group and the OS-only group, respectively. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Both sample size and the retrospective design are limitations of this study. The decision to embark on a specific reproductive treatment strategy was based on patient preference, after counseling on their treatment options. This precludes direct comparison of the efficiency of reproductive treatment options in past EOC users in this study. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Reporting on clinical outcomes of women who underwent EOC and returned to the clinic to embark on divergent reproductive treatment strategies is mandatory to establish guidelines for best clinical practice in this growing patient population. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): None. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: N/A.",0
Spanish multidisciplinary consensus on the characteristics of severe asthma patients on biologic treatment who are candidates for at-home administration.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Biologic therapies are known to reduce exacerbations and improve severe uncontrolled asthma management. The at-home administration of biologics has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the characteristics of severe uncontrolled asthma patients who may benefit from at-home administration of biologic therapy have yet to be identified. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This project is based on the Delphi method, designed to reach an expert consensus through a multidisciplinary scientific committee addressing the following questions: clinical characteristics, treatment adherence, patient or caregiver administration ability, patient self-care, relationship with the healthcare professional, patient preference, and access to the hospital. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-one healthcare professionals (pulmonologists, allergists, nurses, and hospital pharmacists) completed two Delphi consensus questionnaires. Fourteen items were identified as priority characteristics, the first five being: 1. The patient follows the healthcare team's indications/recommendations to control their disease, 2. The patient is capable of detecting any deterioration in their disease and of identifying exacerbation triggers, 3. The patient receives biologic therapy and has stable disease with no vital risk, 4. The patient takes responsibility for their self-care, 5. The patient has occupational/educational obligations that prevent them from going to the hospital regularly. CONCLUSION: Disease stability and control plus the ability to identify exacerbation triggers are the most important characteristics when opting for at-home administration for a patient with severe uncontrolled asthma on biologic therapy. These recommendations could be applicable in clinical practice.",0
Patient preferences for attributes of injected or infused preventive migraine medications: Findings from a discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess preferences among adults with migraine for differentiating attributes of injected or infused preventive treatment options and evaluate their importance in determining a treatment choice. BACKGROUND: Adults with migraine and health-care providers consider many factors when making treatment decisions. Injected or infused preventive migraine treatment options differ in several attributes, including mode of administration and dosing frequency, which may be preferentially selected or avoided by patients. Understanding a patient's preference is important for clinicians as they advise on various treatment options. METHODS: A total of 604 US adults diagnosed with migraine participated in an online survey that captured information on demographics, migraine history, and treatment preferences. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was used to evaluate participants' preferences for specific attributes of injected/infused preventive migraine therapies. The DCE data were utilized to estimate attribute importance (expressed as a percentage) and identify subgroups that had different distributions of preferences. RESULTS: In the overall migraine population, mode of administration (28.8%), durability of effectiveness (27.0%), and speed of onset (25.5%) had the highest relative importance, whereas administration setting (9.9%) and dosing frequency (8.8%) had the lowest. Four distinct subgroups were identified: Group 1 (n = 128) preferred self-injection administration and durability of effectiveness; Group 2 (n = 189) expressed aversion to cranial injections; Group 3 (n = 158) prioritized rapid speed of onset; and Group 4 (n = 129) favored health-care provider administration and durability of effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Speed of onset, durability of effectiveness, and mode of administration are key moderators of treatment preference among US adults with migraine. Certain segments of the migraine population prioritize specific treatment attributes over others, with intravenous infusion not considered a barrier in three of four identified segments. Clinicians can best help their patients find the right medication if they understand which medication attributes are most and least important to them.",1
What attributes of abortion care affect people's decision-making? Results from a discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to measure both stated and experimentally ""revealed"" abortion provision preferences among US people with capacity for pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: In July 2022, we recruited US residents assigned female sex at birth and aged 18 to 55 years using Prolific, an online survey hosting platform. We asked participants what first-trimester abortion method and delivery model they would prefer. We also assessed abortion care preferences with a discrete choice experiment, which examined the relative importance of the following care attributes: method, distance, wait time for appointment, delivery model (telehealth vs in-clinic), and cost. RESULTS: More than half of the 887 respondents (59%) self-reported a slight (22%) or strong (37%) preference for medication compared to aspiration abortion; 11% stated no preference. Our discrete choice experiment found that cost and wait time had a greater effect on hypothetical decision-making than did method and delivery model (discrete choice experiment average importances = 44.3 and 23.2, respectively, compared to 15.9 and 8.2, respectively). Simulations indicated that holding other attributes constant, respondents preferred medication to aspiration abortion and telehealth to in-clinic care. CONCLUSIONS: This study, the first to examine abortion preferences in the United States, using a discrete choice experiment, demonstrates the importance of wait time and cost in abortion care decision-making. Our work indicates that for this population, factors related to health care financing and organization may matter more than clinical aspects of care. IMPLICATIONS: Although people in this study preferred medication to aspiration abortion and telehealth to in-clinic care, wait time and cost of care played a greater role in care decision-making. Focusing solely on clinical aspects of care (i.e., method, delivery model) may ignore other attributes of care that are particularly important for potential patients.",1
Patient perspectives on recall period and response options in patient-reported outcome measures for chronic rhinosinusitis symptomatology: An international multi-centered study.,"BACKGROUND: Existing patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) use a variety of recall periods and response scales to assess CRS symptom burden. Global perspectives of CRS patients regarding optimal recall periods and response scales for CRS PROMs are unknown. METHODS: This was a multi-center, cross-sectional study recruiting 461 CRS patients from sites across the United States, Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, and Austria. Participants chose which CRS symptom recall period (1 day, 2 weeks, 1 month, >1 month) was most reflective of their current disease state and upon which to best base treatment recommendations (including surgery). Participants also chose which of six response scales (one visual analogue scale and five Likert scales ranging from four to eight items) was easiest to use, understand, and preferred. RESULTS: A plurality of participants (40.0%) felt their CRS symptoms' current state was best reflected by a 1-month recall period. However, most patients (56.9%) preferred treatment recommendations to be determined by symptoms experienced over a >1 month period. The four- and five-item Likert scales were the easiest to understand (26.0% and 25.4%, respectively) and use (23.4% and 26.7%, respectively). The five-item (26.4% rating it most preferred and 70.9% rating it preferred) and four-item Likert (22.3% rating it most preferred and 56.4% rating it preferred) response scales were most preferred. CONCLUSION: Future PROMs for CRS should consider assessment of symptoms over a 1-month period and use a four- or five-item Likert response scale to reflect global patient preferences. These findings also inform interpretation of current CRS PROMs.",0
