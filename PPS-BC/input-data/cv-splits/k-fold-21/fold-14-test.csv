Preferences for disease-related information and transitional skills among adolescents with congenital heart disease in the early transitional stage.,"PURPOSE: The transition towards adult-focused healthcare comprises a complex process requiring careful, individualized guidance of adolescents with congenital heart disease (CHD). Detailed data on their preferences regarding disease-related information and acquirable transitional skills are mostly lacking. We examined the preferences of CHD adolescents in the early transition stage. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed with adolescents recruited from a transition program. Two questionnaires assessing needs for information and transitional skills were used. Only questionnaires completed in the early transition stage were included. RESULTS: Forty-nine adolescents participated (mean age 15.9 ± 1.2 years, 43% girls). 59% requested information about their heart and previous and/or future surgeries/interventions, 45% about sports and medication, and a maximum of 27% about psychosocial topics. More girls than boys requested surgical information (76% versus 46%; p = 0.04). Adolescents with severely complex CHD more often requested information about medication than those with moderately complex CHD (63% versus 28%; p = 0.02). Older adolescents were less likely to request surgical information (OR = 0.53; 95%CI [0.26-0.88]; p = 0.03). Up to 83% of the adolescents perceived their skills as insufficient, but less than 14% was interested in acquiring skills.    Conclusion: Adolescents were mainly interested in medical topics, followed by lifestyle information. The informational needs tended to decrease with age. Timely gauging individual needs and delivering information, ideally in the early teens, appear important when providing person-tailored transitional care in CHD. Paradoxically, although the transitional skills were low-perceived, there was limited motivation to improve them. This paradox requires further investigation to better tailor transition interventions.     Clinical trial registration: Not applicable. WHAT IS KNOWN: • Transition towards adult life and care requires careful patient guidance. A person-tailored approach is strongly encouraged. However, details on preferences regarding disease-related information and transitional skills are scarce in adolescents with CHD. WHAT IS NEW: • This study showed that adolescents with CHD in early transition mainly need medical-related information. Their informational needs tend to decrease with age necessitating timely gauging for interest and delivering information. Adolescents report a low need to acquire transitional skills despite low self-esteemed skills levels.",0
Study protocol of a randomized controlled trial of fistula vs. graft arteriovenous vascular access in older adults with end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis: the AV access trial.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with hemodialysis requires surgical creation of an arteriovenous (AV) vascular access-fistula (AVF) or graft (AVG)-to avoid (or limit) the use of a central venous catheter (CVC). AVFs have long been considered the first-line vascular access option, with AVGs as second best. Recent studies have suggested that, in older adults, AVGs may be a better strategy than AVFs. Lacking evidence from well-powered randomized clinical trials, integration of these results into clinical decision making is challenging. The main objective of the AV Access Study is to compare, between the two types of AV access, clinical outcomes that are important to patients, physicians, and policy makers. METHODS: This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in adults ≥ 60 years old receiving chronic hemodialysis via a CVC. Eligible participants must have co-existing cardiovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, and/or diabetes mellitus; and vascular anatomy suitable for placement of either type of AV access. Participants are randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to a strategy of AVG or AVF creation. An estimated 262 participants will be recruited across 7 healthcare systems, with average follow-up of 2 years. Questionnaires will be administered at baseline and semi-annually. The primary outcome is the rate of CVC-free days per 100 patient-days. The primary safety outcome is the cumulative incidence of vascular access (CVC or AV access)-related severe infections-defined as access infections that lead to hospitalization or death. Secondary outcomes include access-related healthcare costs and patients' experiences with vascular access care between the two treatment groups. DISCUSSION: In the absence of studies using robust and unbiased research methodology to address vascular access care for hemodialysis patients, clinical decisions are limited to inferences from observational studies. The goal of the AV Access Study is to generate evidence to optimize vascular access care, based on objective, age-specific criteria, while incorporating goals of care and patient preference for vascular access type in clinical decision-making. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is being conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration, and has been approved by the central institutional review board (IRB) of Wake Forest University Health Sciences (approval number: 00069593) and local IRB of each participating clinical center; and was registered on Nov 27, 2020, at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04646226).",0
A scoping review of shared care models for rheumatoid arthritis with patient-initiated follow-up.,"OBJECTIVE: An emerging strategy to address access challenges to rheumatologists for patients with RA is shared care between primary and specialist care, with patient-initiated rheumatologist follow-up as needed. The objective of this scoping review was to explore studies implementing this model of care. METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched from 01/01/2000-31/03/2022 using three main concepts (RA, shared care, patient-initiated follow-up). English-language studies of any design were included if they described the implementation and/or outcomes of shared care model for RA with patient-initiated follow-up. Two authors reviewed and selected articles in duplicate and extracted data on study characteristics, care model implementation and outcomes according to a pre-specified protocol. RESULTS: Following duplicate removal, 1578 articles were screened for inclusion and 58 underwent full-text review. Sixteen articles were included, representing 10 unique studies. Five studies had qualitative outcomes and two were pre-implementation studies. Model implementation varied significantly between studies. Effectiveness data was available in 10 studies and demonstrated equivalent outcomes for the model of care (disease activity, radiographic damage, quality of life). Health system costs were equivalent or lower than usual care. While satisfaction with care was equivalent or improved in shared care models with patient-initiated follow-up, some concerns were expressed in qualitative evaluation around appropriate patient selection for such models, and information for health equity evaluation was not reported. CONCLUSIONS: While shared care models with patient-initiated follow-up may offer comparable outcomes for RA, further work is required to understand patient preferences, health equity considerations and longer-term outcomes for such models of care.",0
Talking technology: exploring chatbots as a tool for cataract patient education.,"CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Worldwide, millions suffer from cataracts, which impair vision and quality of life. Cataract education improves outcomes, satisfaction, and treatment adherence. Lack of health literacy, language and cultural barriers, personal preferences, and limited resources may all impede effective communication. BACKGROUND: AI can improve patient education by providing personalised, interactive, and accessible information tailored to patient understanding, interest, and motivation. AI chatbots can have human-like conversations and give advice on numerous topics. METHODS: This study investigated the efficacy of chatbots in cataract patient education relative to traditional resources like the AAO website, focusing on information accuracy,understandability, actionability, and readability. A descriptive comparative design was used to analyse quantitative data from frequently asked questions about cataracts answered by ChatGPT, Bard, Bing AI, and the AAO website. SOLO taxonomy, PEMAT, and the Flesch-Kincaid ease score were used to collect and analyse the data. RESULTS: Chatbots scored higher than AAO website on cataract-related questions in terms of accuracy (mean SOLO score ChatGPT: 3.1 ± 0.31, Bard: 2.9 ± 0.72, Bing AI: 2.65 ± 0.49, AAO website: 2.4 ± 0.6, (p < 0.001)). For understandability (mean PEMAT-U score AAO website: 0,89 ± 0,04, ChatGPT 0,84 ± 0,02, Bard: 0,84 ± 0,02, Bing AI: 0,81 ± 0,02, (p < 0.001)), and actionability (mean PEMAT-A score ChatGPT: 0.86 ± 0.03, Bard: 0.85 ± 0.06, Bing AI: 0.81 ± 0.05, AAO website: 0.81 ± 0.06, (p < 0.001)) AAO website scored better than chatbots. Flesch-Kincaid readability ease analysis showed that Bard (55,5 ± 8,48) had the highest mean score, followed by AAO website (51,96 ± 12,46), Bing AI (41,77 ± 9,53), and ChatGPT (34,38 ± 9,75, (p < 0.001)). CONCLUSION: Chatbots have the potential to provide more detailed and accurate data than the AAO website. On the other hand, the AAO website has the advantage of providing information that is more understandable and practical. When patient preferences are not taken into account, generalised or biased information can decrease reliability.",0
Understanding patient cost-sharing thresholds for diabetes treatment attributes via a discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: The process used to prefer certain products across drug classes for diabetes is generally focused on comparative effectiveness and cost. However, payers rarely tie patient preference for treatment attributes to formulary management resulting in a misalignment of value defined by providers, payers, and patients. OBJECTIVES: To explore patients' willingness to pay (WTP) for the predetermined high-value and low-value type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatments within a health plan. METHODS: A cross-sectional discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey was used to determine patient preference for the benefit, risk, and cost attributes of T2DM treatments. A comprehensive literature review of patient preference studies in diabetes and a review of guidelines and medical literature identified study attributes. Patients and diabetes experts were interviewed and instructed to identify, prioritize, and comment on which attributes of diabetes treatments were most important to T2DM patients. The patients enrolled in a health plan were asked to respond to the survey. A multinomial logit model was developed to determine the relative importance and the patient's WTP of each attribute. The patients' relative values based on WTPs for T2DM treatments were calculated and compared with the treatments by a health plan. RESULTS: A total of 7 attributes were selected to develop a web-based DCE questionnaire survey. The responses from a total of 58 patients were analyzed. Almost half (48.3%) of the respondents took oral medications and injections for T2DM. The most prevalent side effects due to diabetes medications were gastrointestinal (43.1%), followed by weight gain (39.7%) and nausea (32.8%). Patients were willing to pay more for treatments with proven cardiovascular benefit and for the risk reduction of hospitalization from heart failure. On the other hand, they would pay less for treatments with higher gastrointestinal side effects. Patients were willing to pay the most for sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist agents and the least for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides information to better align patient, provider, and payer preferences in both benefit design and value-based formulary strategy for diabetes treatments. A preferred placement of treatments with cardiovascular benefits and lower adverse gastrointestinal side effects may lead to increased adherence to medications and improved clinical outcomes at a lower overall cost to both patients and their health plan. DISCLOSURES: This study was supported by a grant from the PhRMA Foundation.",1
Radiation Therapy Can Be Safely Incorporated into Pretransplantation Treatment Regimens for Patients with Multiple Myeloma.,"Primary treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) often involves systemic induction therapy (SIT) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Radiation therapy (RT) is sometimes used for palliation; however, many practitioners avoid RT out of concern that future peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection required for ASCT may be compromised. In this study, we retrospectively examined the possible effect of RT on PBPC collection. We reviewed the charts of 732 patients with MM treated with RT at our institution from 1999 to 2017, including patients who received RT prior to PBPC collection for planned ASCT. RT plans (both MM and non-MM RT) were reviewed to estimate the percentage of bone marrow (BM) treated using published estimates of skeletal BM distribution. Statistics were performed using Pearson correlation and the t-test. The 732 MM patients included 485 planned for ASCT; of these, 223 received RT prior to PBPC collection and were included in the final cohort. The median age at PBPC collection was 59 years (range, 33 to 80 years). For SIT, patients received combination regimens including the following agents: bortezomib (142 patients; 64%), lenalidomide (111 patients; 50%), and alkylators (46 patients; 21%). Nine patients (4%) received dexamethasone alone. The median cumulative %BM treated per patient was 6.7 (range .0 to 47.4). The median RT dose was 24 Gy (range, 10.0 to 75.6 Gy). Mobilization was performed using granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone (189 patients; 85%), G-CSF with plerixafor (15 patients; 7%), or chemotherapy (19 patients; 9%). A median of 7.8 × 10(6) CD34(+)/kg PBPCs (range, .5 to 54.8× 10(6) CD34(+)/kg) were collected in a median of 3 (range, 1 to 9) apheresis procedures. One hundred ninety-six patients (99%) collected ≥2.0 × 10(6) CD34(+)/kg PBPCs, and 166 (83%) collected >5.0 × 10(6) CD34(+)/kg PBPCs. The number of PBPCs collected was not associated with %BM treated (P = .15) or RT dose (P = .56). The number of apheresis procedures performed was not associated with %BM treated (P = .54) or RT dose (P = .85). The amount of PBPCs collected did not differ significantly between patients receiving RT to the pelvis/sacrum (P = .20) and those receiving RT to the spine (P = .13). The time to platelet engraftment was longer for patients with higher %BM treated (P = .02). Eleven patients did not undergo a confirmed ASCT, owing to patient preference (3 patients), trial therapy (1 patient), comorbidities (1 patient), election for hospice (1 patient), inadequate collection (4 patients), or inadequate follow-up (1 patient). In our study cohort, RT prior to ASCT did not impair successful ASCT. RT must be carefully planned and delivered to ensure safe incorporation into pre-ASCT treatment regimens.",0
Patient motivation and preferences in changing co-occurring health risk behaviors in general hospital patients.,"OBJECTIVES: More than 60% of general hospital patients report ≥ 2 health risk behaviors (HRBs), i.e. tobacco smoking, at-risk alcohol use, unhealthy diet, and/or insufficient physical activity. This study investigates a) the association between numbers of HRBs and motivation to change, b) patient preferences for receiving feedback on HRBs, and c) patients' expected gain in quality of life if behavior change made. METHODS: In 2020/2021, 256 18-64-year-old general hospital patients (72.1% of eligibles) reported on their motivation to change each of their HRBs. Associations between HRB number and motivation were assessed using multivariate linear regressions. Participants ranked HRBs concerning their interest in receiving feedback and concerning their expected gain in quality of life if behavior change occurred. RESULTS: Higher HRB number was negatively related to motivation among at-risk alcohol users (p = 0.034); 24.6% expected gain in their quality of life from behavior change. Participants overall appeared more favorable to feedback about vegetable/fruit intake and physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Unhealthier lifestyle may be accompanied by decreased motivation to change in at-risk alcohol users. In case of co-occurring HRBs, asking patients for expected gain in quality of life may help guiding intervention target. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Relying on patient selection only, may often leave substance-use unaddressed.",0
Preference Elicitation and Treatment Decision-Making Among Men Diagnosed With Prostate Cancer: Randomized Controlled Trial Results of Healium.,"BACKGROUND: Elicitation of patients' preferences is an integral part of shared decision-making, the recommended approach for prostate cancer decision-making. Existing decision aids for this population often do not specifically focus on patients' preferences. Healium is a brief interactive web-based decision aid that aims to elicit patients' treatment preferences and is designed for a low health literate population. OBJECTIVE: This study used a randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether Healium, designed to target preference elicitation, is as efficacious as Healing Choices, a comprehensive education and decision tool, in improving outcomes for decision-making and emotional quality of life. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who had not yet made a treatment decision were randomly assigned to the brief Healium intervention or Healing Choices, a decision aid previously developed by our group that serves as a virtual information center on prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. Assessments were completed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 3 months post baseline, and included decisional outcomes (decisional conflict, satisfaction with decision, and preparation for decision-making), and emotional quality of life (anxiety/tension and depression), along with demographics, comorbidities, and health literacy. RESULTS: A total of 327 individuals consented to participate in the study (171 were randomized to the Healium intervention arm and 156 were randomized to Healing Choices). The majority of the sample was non-Hispanic (272/282, 96%), White (239/314, 76%), married (251/320, 78.4%), and was on average 62.4 (SD 6.9) years old. Within both arms, there was a significant decrease in decisional conflict from baseline to 6 weeks postbaseline (Healium, P≤.001; Healing Choices, P≤.001), and a significant increase in satisfaction with one's decision from 6 weeks to 3 months (Healium, P=.04; Healing Choices, P=.01). Within both arms, anxiety/tension (Healium, P=.23; Healing Choices, P=.27) and depression (Healium, P=.001; Healing Choices, P≤.001) decreased from baseline to 6 weeks, but only in the case of depression was the decrease statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Healium, our brief decision aid focusing on treatment preference elicitation, is as successful in reducing decisional conflict as our previously tested comprehensive decision aid, Healing Choices, and has the added benefit of brevity, making it the ideal tool for integration into the physician consultation and electronic medical record.

Effects of Participant's Choice of Different Digital Interventions on Outcomes for Binge-Spectrum Eating Disorders: A Pilot Doubly Randomized Preference Trial.,"It is unclear whether offering individuals a choice between different digital intervention programs affects treatment outcomes. To generate initial insights, we conducted a pilot doubly randomized preference trial to test whether offering individuals with binge-spectrum eating disorder a choice between two digital interventions is causally linked with superior outcomes than random assignment to these interventions. Participants with recurrent binge eating were randomized to either a choice (n = 77) or no-choice (n = 78) group. Those in the choice group could choose one of the two digital programs, while those in the no-choice group were assigned a program at random. The two digital interventions (a broad and a focused program) took 4 weeks to complete, were based on cognitive-behavioral principles and have demonstrated comparable efficacy, but differ in scope, content, and targeted change mechanisms. Most participants (79%) allocated to the choice condition chose the broad program. While both groups experienced improvements in primary (Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire global scores and number of binge eating episodes over the past month) and secondary outcomes (dietary restraint, body image concerns, etc.), no significant between-group differences were observed. The two groups did not differ on dropout rates, nor on most indices of intervention engagement. Findings provide preliminary insights towards the role of client preferences in digital mental health interventions for eating disorders. Client preferences may not determine outcomes when digital interventions are based on similar underlying principles, although larger trials are needed to confirm this.",0
Stability of Stated Preferences: Vaccine Priority Setting before and during the First COVID-19 Lockdown.,"BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are frequently used to study preferences and quantify tradeoffs in decision making. It is important to understand how stable their results are. OBJECTIVE: To investigate to what extent an extreme change in context, the COVID-19 pandemic, affected preferences for vaccine priority setting, as observed in an earlier DCE. METHODS: We replicated a DCE in which participants had to prioritize vaccination programs for public funding. The initial DCE was executed in Flanders (Belgium) right before the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (December 2019, N = 1,636). The replicated DCE was executed 6 months later when the population was in lockdown (April 2020, N = 1,127). A total of 612 respondents participated in both waves of the DCE. We used panel mixed logit models to quantify attribute and level importance and compared utility estimates for consistency. RESULTS: The number of vaccine-preventable deaths became less important during the pandemic than before, whereas the influential attributes, the vaccine's contribution to disease eradication and certainty about vaccine effectiveness became even more important. Respondents attached equal importance to the number of patients with transient or permanent morbidity, to the disease's economic impact as well as to its equity profile. CONCLUSION: Different preferences for vaccine priority setting were observed during the first COVID-19 lockdown as compared with before, although these differences were, given the extreme nature of the changing circumstances, relatively small. HIGHLIGHTS: We replicated a discrete choice experiment (DCE) about vaccine priority setting during the first COVID-19 lockdown and compared results with those from the original setting.The major attributes, contribution to disease eradication, and scientific certainty about vaccine effectiveness became even more important than they already were, whereas avoidable mortality became less important.Respondents attached equal importance to the number of patients with transient or permanent morbidity, to the disease's economic impact as well as to its equity profile.An extreme change in directly related context to the choice assignment led to changes in stated preferences, although these changes were relatively small, given the extreme change in context.Priorities in the second DCE were even less aligned with cost-effectiveness analysis than those observed initially.",1
Materials and manufacturing techniques for occlusal splints: A literature review.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the materials and fabrications methods of occlusal splints with their advantages and shortcomings and to clarify the indications for each. BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) encompass a range of conditions affecting the masticatory system. Occlusal splints are currently recognised as a viable option for the management of TMDs when they are adopted in conjunction with additional approaches varying from conservative procedures (counselling, biofeedback, physical therapy, pharmacotherapy) to irreversible and less conservative ones (occlusal adjustments, orthodontics, arthroscopy and surgery). These splints can vary in design, function and material. The components used to fabricate the splints must withstand occlusal forces, be aesthetically pleasing, comfortable and minimally interfering with function and phonetics. Traditional methods for fabricating splints include sprinkle-on, thermoforming and lost wax techniques. However, with the advancement of CAD/CAM technology, additive (3D printing) and subtractive (milling) manufacturing methods expand the range of possibilities by introducing novel solutions for elaborating splints. METHODS: An electronic search was conducted on PubMed using the following keywords: ""occlusal splint"", ""guard and ""materials"", and ""manufacturing."" Thirteen in vitro publications were screened and they consisted of four clinical studies, nine reviews (three of them were systematic reviews), and five case reports. CONCLUSION: The choice of material is crucial for the success of splint therapy. Factors such as biocompatibility, ease of fabrication, adjustability, cost and patient preference should be considered. Newer materials and techniques are emerging because of advancements in material science and manufacturing techniques. However, it should be noted that most of the evidence is based on in vitro studies with different methodologies, limiting their validity in daily practice.",0
Perceptions of shared decision making in gastroenterology and inflammatory bowel disease: A qualitative analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Shared decision-making (SDM) is the partnership and discussion between clinicians and patients to make an appropriate decision based on scientific evidence and patient preferences. Many benefits are associated with SDM; however, little is known about its awareness or use by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) clinicians in gastroenterology departments across Israel. This study aims to identify barriers and facilitators in implementing SDM as standard practice to achieve optimal disease management and personalized care for patients with IBD. METHODS: Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with IBD clinicians across Israel to identify the barriers and facilitators for SDM use. An interview guide was developed, based on the systematic approach of the Theoretical Domain Framework (TDF). Interview transcripts were coded into theoretical domains to identify factors that may impact SDM. RESULTS: Sixteen gastroenterologists from nine different hospitals were interviewed. Common TDF domains that presented as barriers were: knowledge, skills, social/professional role and identity, environmental context and resources, and reinforcement. Most participants had never heard the precise term ""shared decision making"" and lacked formal training on SDM. CONCLUSION: This study identified key barriers and facilitators to SDM in IBD clinics across Israel. Main barriers of SDM include limited or nonexistent training; clinicians were unaware of SDM guidelines or techniques. The main facilitators of SDM were clinicians' social and professional role and identity and their beliefs about the influence of IBD and/or CD. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: These influencing factors and TDF domains identified provide a basis for developing future interventions to improve the implementation of SDM within IBD management.",0
Exercise behaviours and motivation after a first psychotic episode: A digital intervention.,"AIM: Research has demonstrated that participation in aerobic exercise can have significant beneficial effects across both physical and mental health domains for individuals who are in the early phase of schizophrenia. Despite these notable benefits of exercise, deficits in motivation and a lack of methods to increase engagement are significant barriers for exercise participation, limiting these potentially positive effects. Fortunately, digital health tools have the potential to improve adherence to an exercise program. The present study examined the role of motivation for exercise and the effects of an automated digital text messaging program on participation in an aerobic exercise program. METHODS: A total of 46 first-episode psychosis participants from an ongoing 12-month randomized clinical trial (Enhancing Cognitive Training through Exercise Following a First Schizophrenia Episode (CT&E-RCT)) were included in an analysis to examine the efficacy of motivational text messaging. Personalized motivational text message reminders were sent to participants with the aim of increasing engagement in the exercise program. RESULTS: We found that participants with higher levels of intrinsic motivation to participate in a text messaging program and in an exercise intervention completed a higher proportion of individual, at-home exercise sessions. In a between groups analysis, participants who received motivational text messages, compared to those who did not, completed a higher proportion of at-home exercise sessions. CONCLUSION: These results indicate the importance of considering a person's level of motivation for exercise and the potential utility of using individualized and interactive mobile text messaging reminders to increase engagement in aerobic exercise in the early phase of psychosis. We emphasize the need for understanding how individualized patient preferences and needs interplay between intrinsic motivation and digital health interventions for young adults.",0
DEXTENZA versus Topical Steroid or Antihistamine Therapy for Treatment of Allergic Conjunctivitis.,"PURPOSE: To compare clinical outcomes and patient preference for the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (DEX) versus topical loteprednol (LOT) or olopatadine (OLO) for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis in a real-world model of allergen exposure. METHODS: This was a prospective comparative trial. Adults with testing-confirmed bilateral allergic conjunctivitis received DEX in the more symptomatic eye and either LOT 2 times daily or OLO once daily for 30 days in the fellow eye. The primary outcome was patient preference for treatment. Clinical outcomes included ocular itching and hyperemia, lid swelling, and watering/tearing. Safety outcomes included intraocular pressure (IOP). RESULTS: Thirty patients participated and completed the study. All received DEX in the eye with worse symptoms and 15 received LOT and the other 15 received OLO in the other eye. Patients preferred DEX (10/15; 66.7%) over LOT (4/15; 26.7%), with one patient having no preference (p = 0.0103). Patients had no preference between DEX (8/15; 53.3%) and OLO (6/15; 40%), with one patient having no preference (p = 0.1044). In the DEX/LOT cohort, ocular itching and hyperemia improved more with DEX than LOT (p ≤ 0.009), while in the DEX/OLO cohort, the DEX eyes showed greater improvement in conjunctival hyperemia (p < 0.0001) but not itching (p = 0.074). No between-group differences were seen in eyelid swelling or tearing/watering in either cohort. Mean change in IOP was similar between the DEX and LOT eyes (p = 0.4921), and mean IOP rose more in the DEX eyes than the OLO eyes (by <1 mmHg; p = 0.0403). CONCLUSION: Overall, this real-world study demonstrated that the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert was as effective as a topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer and more effective than topical steroids in relieving the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. This insert should be considered as an alternative to topical therapy for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.",0
Patient preferences for key drivers and facilitators of adoption of mHealth technology to manage depression: A discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: In time, we may be able to detect the early onset of symptoms of depression and even predict relapse using behavioural data gathered through mobile technologies. However, barriers to adoption exist and understanding the importance of these factors to users is vital to ensure maximum adoption. METHOD: In a discrete choice experiment, people with a history of depression (N = 171) were asked to select their preferred technology from a series of vignettes containing four characteristics: privacy, clinical support, established benefit and device accuracy (i.e., ability to detect symptoms), with different levels. Mixed logit models were used to establish what was most likely to affect adoption. Sub-group analyses explored effects of age, gender, education, technology acceptance and familiarity, and nationality. RESULTS: Higher level of privacy, greater clinical support, increased perceived benefit and better device accuracy were important. Accuracy was the most important, with only modest compromises willing to be made to increase other factors such as privacy. Established benefit was the least valued of the attributes with participants happy with technology that had possible but unknown benefits. Preferences were moderated by technology acceptance, age, nationality, and educational background. CONCLUSION: For people with a history of depression, adoption of technology may be driven by the desire for accurate detection of symptoms. However, people with lower technology acceptance and educational attainment, those who were younger, and specific nationalities may be willing to compromise on some accuracy for more privacy and clinical support. These preferences should help shape design of mHealth tools.",1
"Validation of the Cooper-Norcross Inventory of Preferences (C-NIP) in Chinese lay clients and mental health professionals: Factor structure, measurement invariance, and scale differences.","The Cooper-Norcross Inventory of Preferences (C-NIP) is one of the most widely used measures of psychotherapy preferences. However, its psychometric properties have not been examined in non-Western samples. Research on disparities between the preferences of mental health professionals and their clients is also limited. We evaluated the C-NIP's psychometric properties and measurement invariance in Chinese lay clients and mental health professionals and evaluated the latent mean differences between clients' and professionals' scores on the C-NIP's four scales (preference for therapist vs. client directiveness, emotional intensity vs. emotional reserve, past vs. present orientation, and warm support vs. focused challenge). This cross-sectional investigation involved 301 lay clients and 856 mental health professionals who completed the Chinese version of the C-NIP. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) were used to examine the factor structure of the C-NIP. ESEM provided stronger evidence than CFA for the four-factor model in both samples. The four scales had adequate internal consistency in both the lay clients (αs = .68-.89) and the mental health professionals (αs = .70-.80). Partial scalar invariance was established across these two populations. Chinese mental health professionals preferred less therapist directiveness, past orientation, and warm support-but more emotional intensity-than Chinese lay clients (ds = 0.25-0.90). Culture-specific cutoff values (norms) to identify strong therapy preferences were established. This study supports the application of the C-NIP to non-Western populations and suggests that discrepancies between the preferences of lay clients and mental health professionals are a cross-cultural phenomenon.

"Acceptability of patient-centered, multi-disciplinary medication therapy management recommendations: results from the INCREASE randomized study.","BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy and inappropriate medications may be a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Medication therapy management (MTM) interventions may mitigate medication-induced cognitive dysfunction and delay onset of symptomatic impairment. The objective of the current study is to describe an MTM protocol for a patient-centered team intervention (pharmacist and non-pharmacist clinician) in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) directed at delaying the symptomatic onset of ADRD. METHODS: Community dwelling adults 65 + years, non-demented, using ≥ 1 potentially inappropriate medications (PIM) were enrolled in an RCT to evaluate the effect of an MTM intervention on improving medication appropriateness and cognition (NCT02849639). The MTM intervention involved a three-step process: (1) pharmacist identified potential medication-related problems (MRPs) and made initial recommendations for prescribed and over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements; (2) study team reviewed all initial recommendations together with the participants, allowing for revisions prior to the finalized recommendations; (3) participant responses to final recommendations were recorded. Here, we describe initial recommendations, changes during team engagement, and participant responses to final recommendations. RESULTS: Among the 90 participants, a mean 6.7 ± 3.6 MRPs per participant were reported. Of the 259 initial MTM recommendations made for the treatment group participants (N = 46), 40% percent underwent revisions in the second step. Participants reported willingness to adopt 46% of final recommendations and expressed need for additional primary care input in response to 38% of final recommendations. Willingness to adopt final recommendations was highest when therapeutic switches were offered and/or with anticholinergic medications. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of modifications to MTM recommendations demonstrated that pharmacists' initial MTM recommendations often changed following the participation in the multidisciplinary decision-making process that incorporated patient preferences. The team was encouraged to see a correlation between engaging patients and a positive overall response towards participant acceptance of final MTM recommendations.

Learning From Clinical Supervisor Practice Variability: Exploring Medical Resident and Fellow Experiences and Interpretations.,"PURPOSE: Clinical practice variability is characterized by 2 or more clinicians making different treatment decisions despite encountering a similar case. This study explores how medical residents and fellows experience and interpret intersupervisor clinical practice variability and how these variations influence learning. METHOD: Seventeen senior residents or fellows in internal medicine, hematology, or thrombosis medicine (postgraduate year 3 or above) participated in semistructured interviews after a clinical rotation in thrombosis medicine from December 2019 to March 2021. Data collection and analysis occurred iteratively and concurrently in a manner consistent with constructivist grounded theory. Variation theory was used to guide the development of some interview questions. A central tenet of this theory is that learning occurs by experiencing 3 sequential patterns of variation: contrast, generalization, and fusion. Participants were recruited purposively with respect to specialty until theoretical sufficiency was reached. RESULTS: Clinical practice variability was experienced by all participants. Residents and fellows attributed practice variability to intrinsic differences among supervisors; interinstitutional differences; selection and interpretation of evidence; patient preferences, priorities, and fears; and their own participation in the decision-making process. Clinical practice variability helped residents and fellows discern key features of cases that influenced decision-making (contrast), group similar cases so that the appropriate evidence could be applied (generalization), and develop attitudes consistent with providing individualized patient care (fusion). Observing practice variability was more helpful for fifth- and sixth-year residents and less helpful for third- and fourth-year residents. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical practice variability helped residents and fellows discern critical aspects, group similar patients, and practice individualized medicine. Future research should characterize how clinical practice variability influences learning across the spectrum of training, how supervisors could encourage learning from practice variability, and how curricula could be modified to allow learners greater opportunity to reflect on and consolidate the practice differences they observe.",0
Experiences of patients and next of kin on informed consent process for emergency surgery in two Urban university teaching hospitals in Uganda: a comparative cross sectional study.,"Informed consent for emergency surgery is a process in which a patient or their next of kin must make quick decisions required for surgery in a life-threatening situation or surgery that may have life-altering outcomes. The objective of the study was to describe patients and their next of kin experiences and factors influencing the informed consent process in two urban university teaching hospitals in Uganda. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey involving patients who underwent emergency surgery and their next of kin was conducted in two tertiary care hospitals; one public and one private-not-for profit institution. A questionnaire was administered to collect sociodemographic information, type of Surgery that was done, how informed consent was obtained and experiences and expectations from the informed consent process. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the variables was done. RESULTS: We collected data from 210 patients from a public hospital and 170 from a private-not-for profit hospital. Overall, most patients did not have the risks of the surgery communicated to them (79.7%), were not given alternative options (87.6%) and had no opportunity to ask questions (57.4%). Patients at the private institution had 3.35 times the odds of expecting the consent form to be explained to them than those at the public institution. Patients at the public hospital had 0.12 times the odds of preferring to have consent administered by a nurse than patients at the private institution OR 0.12 (0.05-0.29, p < 0.001). Patients in the public institution had 0.18 times the odds of preferring to have consent administered by a doctor than patients in the private institution OR 0.18 (0.08-0.45, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients in both public and private institutions are not informed about the risks of surgery, alternative options and are not given the opportunity to ask questions. Interpretation of the findings of this study on patient preferences on who administered consent though statistically significant were inconclusive due to the responses not being mutually exclusive.",0
Physician- and Patient-Elicited Barriers and Facilitators to Implementation of a Machine Learning-Based Screening Tool for Peripheral Arterial Disease: Preimplementation Study With Physician and Patient Stakeholders.,"BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is underdiagnosed, partially due to a high prevalence of atypical symptoms and a lack of physician and patient awareness. Implementing clinical decision support tools powered by machine learning algorithms may help physicians identify high-risk patients for diagnostic workup. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a novel machine learning-based screening tool for PAD among physician and patient stakeholders using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). METHODS: We performed semistructured interviews with physicians and patients from the Stanford University Department of Primary Care and Population Health, Division of Cardiology, and Division of Vascular Medicine. Participants answered questions regarding their perceptions toward machine learning and clinical decision support for PAD detection. Rapid thematic analysis was performed using templates incorporating codes from CFIR constructs. RESULTS: A total of 12 physicians (6 primary care physicians and 6 cardiovascular specialists) and 14 patients were interviewed. Barriers to implementation arose from 6 CFIR constructs: complexity, evidence strength and quality, relative priority, external policies and incentives, knowledge and beliefs about intervention, and individual identification with the organization. Facilitators arose from 5 CFIR constructs: intervention source, relative advantage, learning climate, patient needs and resources, and knowledge and beliefs about intervention. Physicians felt that a machine learning-powered diagnostic tool for PAD would improve patient care but cited limited time and authority in asking patients to undergo additional screening procedures. Patients were interested in having their physicians use this tool but raised concerns about such technologies replacing human decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Patient- and physician-reported barriers toward the implementation of a machine learning-powered PAD diagnostic tool followed four interdependent themes: (1) low familiarity or urgency in detecting PAD; (2) concerns regarding the reliability of machine learning; (3) differential perceptions of responsibility for PAD care among primary care versus specialty physicians; and (4) patient preference for physicians to remain primary interpreters of health care data. Facilitators followed two interdependent themes: (1) enthusiasm for clinical use of the predictive model and (2) willingness to incorporate machine learning into clinical care. Implementation of machine learning-powered diagnostic tools for PAD should leverage provider support while simultaneously educating stakeholders on the importance of early PAD diagnosis. High predictive validity is necessary for machine learning models but not sufficient for implementation.",0
Aversion to Mesh Use in Pelvic Floor Surgery in a Latina Population at the U.S.-Mexico Border.,"IMPORTANCE: Limited studies have examined patient aversion to mesh use in pelvic surgery, especially in Latinas. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess aversion to pelvic surgery with mesh for urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse in a sample of Latinas on the U.S.-Mexico border. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of self-identified Latinas with symptoms of pelvic floor disorders, recruited at their initial consultation visit at a single, academic urogynecology clinic. Participants completed a validated survey to assess perceptions of mesh use in pelvic surgery. Participants also completed questionnaires assessing the presence and severity of pelvic floor symptoms and level of acculturation. The primary outcome was aversion to mesh surgery, as indicated by a response of ""yes"" or ""maybe"" to the question ""Based on what you already know, would you avoid surgery using mesh?"" Descriptive analysis, univariate relative risk, and linear regression analysis were completed to identify characteristics associated with mesh avoidance. Significance was assessed and considered at P values <0.05. RESULTS: Ninety-six women were included. Only 6.3% had prior pelvic floor surgery using mesh. Sixty-six percent indicated that they would be likely to avoid pelvic surgery that uses mesh. Only 9.4% indicated that they obtained information regarding mesh directly from medical professionals. Levels of concern regarding the use of mesh varied widely (29.2% not worried, 19.1% somewhat worried, 16.9% very worried). Higher percentages of ""more acculturated"" participants indicated a desire to avoid mesh surgery (58.7% vs 27.3%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this Latina population, a majority of patients indicated an aversion to using mesh in pelvic surgery. Few patients obtained information regarding mesh directly from medical professionals, relying instead on nonmedical sources.",0
"""But I Have a Pacer…There Is No Point in Engaging in Hypothetical Scenarios"": A Non-Imminently Dying Patient's Request for Pacemaker Deactivation.","In this case report, we describe a woman with advancing dementia who still retained decisional capacity and was able to clearly articulate her request for deactivation of her implanted cardiac pacemaker-a scenario that would result in her death. In this case, the patient had the autonomy to make her decision, but clinicians at an outside hospital refused to deactivate her pacemaker even though they were in unanimous agreement that the patient had capacity to make this decision, citing personal discomfort and a belief that her decision seemed out of proportion to her suffering. We evaluated her at our hospital, found her to have decision-making capacity, and deactivated her pacer resulting in her death about 9 days later. While some clinicians may be comfortable discussing patient preferences for device deactivation in patients who are imminently dying, we can find no reports in the literature of requests for device deactivation from patients with terminal diagnoses who are not imminently dying.",0
Older adult preferences regarding benefits and harms of statin and aspirin therapy for cardiovascular primary prevention.,"OBJECTIVE: Personalizing preventive therapies for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is particularly important for older adults, as they tend to have multiple chronic conditions, increased risk for medication adverse effects, and may have heterogenous preferences when weighing health outcomes. However, little is known about outcome preferences related to ASCVD preventive therapies in older adults. METHODS: In May 2021, using an established online panel, KnowledgePanel, we surveyed older US adults aged 65-84 years without history of ASCVD on outcome preferences related to statin therapy (benefit outcomes to be reduced by the therapy: heart attack, stroke; adverse effects: diabetes, abnormal liver test, muscle pain) or aspirin therapy (benefit outcomes: heart attack, stroke; adverse effects: brain bleed, bowel bleed, stomach ulcer). We used standardized best-worst scores (range of -1 for ""least worrisome"" to +1 for ""most worrisome"") and conditional logistic regression to examine the relative importance of the outcomes. RESULTS: In this study, 607 ASCVD-free participants (median age 74, 46% male, 81% White) were included; 304 and 303 completed the statin and aspirin versions of the survey, respectively. For statin-related outcomes, stroke and heart attack were most worrisome (score 0.55; 95% CI 0.51, 0.60) and (0.53; 0.48, 0.58), followed by potential harms of diabetes (-0.07; -0.10, -0.03), abnormal liver test (-0.25; -0.29, -0.20), and muscle pain (-0.77; -0.82, -0.73). For aspirin-related outcomes, stroke and heart attack were similarly most worrisome (0.48; 0.43, 0.52) and (0.43; 0.38, 0.48), followed by brain bleed (0.30; 0.25, 0.34), bowel bleed (-0.31; -0.33, -0.28), and stomach ulcer (-0.90; -0.92, -0.87). Conditional logistic regression and subgroup analyses by age, sex, and race yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults generally consider outcomes related to benefits of ASCVD primary preventive therapies-stroke and heart attack-more important than their adverse effects. Integrating patient preferences with risk assessment is an important next step for personalizing ASCVD preventive therapies for older adults.",1
Preferences for Adjuvant Immunotherapy in Adults with Resected Stage III Melanoma-A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to quantify adult preferences for adjuvant immunotherapy for resected melanoma and the influence of varying levels of key attributes and baseline characteristics. METHODS: A D-efficient design generated 12 choice tasks for two alternative treatments, adjuvant immunotherapy or no adjuvant immunotherapy. Recruitment to the online discrete choice experiment (DCE) occurred via survey dissemination by eight Australian melanoma consumer and professional groups, targeting adults with resected stage III melanoma, considering or having received adjuvant immunotherapy. The DCE included six attributes with two to three levels each, including 3-year risk of recurrence, mild, permanent and fatal adverse events (AEs), drug regimen and annual out-of-pocket costs. A mixed multinomial logit model was used to estimate preferences and calculate marginal rates of substitution and marginal willingness to pay (mWTP). RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 116 respondents, who chose adjuvant immunotherapy over no adjuvant immunotherapy in 70% of choice tasks. Respondents preferred adjuvant immunotherapy when associated with reduced: probabilities of recurrence, permanent and fatal AEs, and out-of-pocket costs. mWTP for an absolute reduction of 1% in 3-year risk of recurrence was less for respondents with lower rather than higher incomes, AU$794 (US$527) and AU$2190 (US$1454) per year. Respondents accepted an additional 4% chance of a permanent AE to reduce their absolute risk of 3-year recurrence by 1%. Respondents were willing to accept an extra 2% chance of 3-year recurrence to lower their chance of a fatal AE by 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Almost three-quarters of respondents chose adjuvant immunotherapy over no adjuvant immunotherapy, preferring treatment that improved efficacy and safety. Findings may inform decisions about access to adjuvant immunotherapy following surgery for melanoma.",1
"Management of Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer. Part I: Intermediate-/High-risk and Locally Advanced Disease, Biochemical Relapse, and Side Effects of Hormonal Treatment: Report of the Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference 2022.","BACKGROUND: Innovations in imaging and molecular characterisation and the evolution of new therapies have improved outcomes in advanced prostate cancer. Nonetheless, we continue to lack high-level evidence on a variety of clinical topics that greatly impact daily practice. To supplement evidence-based guidelines, the 2022 Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC 2022) surveyed experts about key dilemmas in clinical management. OBJECTIVE: To present consensus voting results for select questions from APCCC 2022. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Before the conference, a panel of 117 international prostate cancer experts used a modified Delphi process to develop 198 multiple-choice consensus questions on (1) intermediate- and high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer, (2) biochemical recurrence after local treatment, (3) side effects from hormonal therapies, (4) metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, (5) nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, (6) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and (7) oligometastatic and oligoprogressive prostate cancer. Before the conference, these questions were administered via a web-based survey to the 105 physician panel members (""panellists"") who directly engage in prostate cancer treatment decision-making. Herein, we present results for the 82 questions on topics 1-3. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Consensus was defined as ≥75% agreement, with strong consensus defined as ≥90% agreement. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The voting results reveal varying degrees of consensus, as is discussed in this article and shown in the detailed results in the Supplementary material. The findings reflect the opinions of an international panel of experts and did not incorporate a formal literature review and meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These voting results by a panel of international experts in advanced prostate cancer can help physicians and patients navigate controversial areas of clinical management for which high-level evidence is scant or conflicting. The findings can also help funders and policymakers prioritise areas for future research. Diagnostic and treatment decisions should always be individualised based on patient and cancer characteristics (disease extent and location, treatment history, comorbidities, and patient preferences) and should incorporate current and emerging clinical evidence, therapeutic guidelines, and logistic and economic factors. Enrolment in clinical trials is always strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2022 once again identified important gaps (areas of nonconsensus) that merit evaluation in specifically designed trials. PATIENT SUMMARY: The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) provides a forum to discuss and debate current diagnostic and treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The conference aims to share the knowledge of international experts in prostate cancer with health care providers and patients worldwide. At each APCCC, a panel of physician experts vote in response to multiple-choice questions about their clinical opinions and approaches to managing advanced prostate cancer. This report presents voting results for the subset of questions pertaining to intermediate- and high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer, biochemical relapse after definitive treatment, advanced (next-generation) imaging, and management of side effects caused by hormonal therapies. The results provide a practical guide to help clinicians and patients discuss treatment options as part of shared multidisciplinary decision-making. The findings may be especially useful when there is little or no high-level evidence to guide treatment decisions.",0
Internet search analytics for shoulder arthroplasty: what questions are patients asking?,"BACKGROUND: Common questions about shoulder arthroplasty (SA) searched online by patients and the quality of this content are unknown. The purpose of this study is to uncover questions SA patients search online and determine types and quality of webpages encountered. METHODS: The ""People also ask"" section of Google Search was queried to return 900 questions and associated webpages for general, anatomic, and reverse SA. Questions and webpages were categorized using the Rothwell classification of questions and assessed for quality using the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria. RESULTS: According to Rothwell classification, the composition of questions was fact (54.0%), value (24.7%), and policy (21.3%). The most common webpage categories were medical practice (24.6%), academic (23.2%), and medical information sites (14.4%). Journal articles represented 8.9% of results. The average JAMA score for all webpages was 1.69. Journals had the highest average JAMA score (3.91), while medical practice sites had the lowest (0.89). The most common question was, ""How long does it take to recover from shoulder replacement?"" CONCLUSIONS: The most common questions SA patients ask online involve specific postoperative activities and the timeline of recovery. Most information is from low-quality, non-peer-reviewed websites, highlighting the need for improvement in online resources. By understanding the questions patients are asking online, surgeons can tailor preoperative education to common patient concerns and improve postoperative outcomes.",0
Patient Perspectives on Outpatient versus Inpatient Cervical Ripening for Induction of Labor.,"Objectives Our objectives were to compare patient perceived control and experience with outpatient versus inpatient cervical ripening. Study Design This is a retrospective mixed-methods analysis of a quality improvement initiative focused on the impact to patients of incorporating outpatient cervical ripening into routine practice. Postpartum inpatients who had elected for outpatient cervical ripening (outpatients) and those who met criteria for outpatient cervical ripening but opted for an inpatient setting (inpatients) were invited to participate in the study. Patients completed the Perceived Control in Childbirth Scale, and scores were compared between outpatient and inpatient groups using Mann-Whitney U test. In addition, semi-structured questions elicited feedback prior to hospital discharge, and this qualitative data was analyzed using iterative thematic analysis. Results The study population consisted of 36 outpatients and 38 inpatients. The median score on the Perceived Control in Childbirth Scale was 69 for outpatients and 67 for inpatients (p-value = 0.49), out of a maximum score of 72 (representing the highest level of perceived control). Both groups reported similarly high levels of perceived control, regardless of cervical ripening setting. In the qualitative analysis, pain was the most common theme in both groups. Inpatients reported more distress despite access to stronger pain medications. Outpatients utilized a variety of distraction techniques and expressed gratitude for their setting more than inpatients. Conclusions Outpatient cervical ripening can be a patient-centered solution to obstetric throughput challenges arising from increased numbers of inductions. Those who underwent outpatient cervical ripening had similar perceived control to those who underwent inpatient cervical ripening, suggesting that individual patient preferences are most important in determining the optimal setting for care. The patients' reported experiences identified focus areas for process improvement efforts and future research, including improving patient education regarding expectations and innovating new pain management strategies for cervical ripening.",0
"Patterns in the provision of government-subsidised hormonal postpartum contraception in Queensland, Australia between 2012 and 2018: a population-based cohort study.","BACKGROUND: Short birth intervals and unintended pregnancy are associated with poorer maternal and infant outcomes. There is a risk of pregnancy during the immediate postpartum period unless contraception is initiated. This retrospective cohort study aimed to capture the current patterns of hormonal contraceptive provision within 12 months postpartum in a high-income country. METHODS: We used a linked administrative dataset comprising all women who gave birth in Queensland, Australia between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2018 (n=339 265 pregnancies). We described our cohort by whether they were provided with government-subsidised hormonal contraception within 12 months postpartum. The associations between hormonal postpartum contraceptive provision and demographic and clinical characteristics were examined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression and presented in terms of crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: A majority of women (60.2%) were not provided with government-subsidised hormonal postpartum contraception within 12 months postpartum. Women who were younger (<25 years), were overweight or obese, smoked, were born in Australia, were non-Indigenous, gave birth in a public hospital, or were in the lowest socioeconomic status group were more likely to be provided with postpartum contraception after adjusting for other covariates, compared with their counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to increase the provision and uptake of contraception in the immediate postpartum period are needed to prevent short birth intervals and unintended pregnancy and ensure women's fertility intentions are enacted. Ongoing research is needed to examine the factors influencing women's access to contraceptive services and, further, the types of contraception provided.",0
Phase III Randomized Non-Inferiority Study of OSS Versus PEG + Electrolyte Colonoscopy Preparation in Adolescents.,"OBJECTIVES: Many protocols and preparations are used for bowel cleansing before pediatric colonoscopy but few are based on scientific evidence. We evaluated efficacy, safety, tolerability, and patient preference of oral sulfate solution (OSS) at 75% of the adult dose versus polyethylene glycol (PEG)-electrolyte solution in adolescents presenting for diagnostic colonoscopy. METHODS: Phase III, randomized, evaluator-blinded, non-inferiority study of OSS and PEG in adolescents aged 12-17 years. OSS and PEG were administered in 2 doses on the day before colonoscopy. Primary endpoint included proportion of patients with successful overall preparation (4-point scale). Secondary endpoints included overall and segmental bowel cleansing (Boston Bowel Preparation Scale; BBPS), completed colonoscopies, duration of examination, time to cecal intubation, proportion of nasogastric tubes (NGTs), adverse events (AEs) and acceptability. RESULTS: Successful cleansing was achieved in 71.4% and 79.0% of patients receiving OSS and PEG, respectively [adjusted difference -7.61 (95% confidence interval, CI, -18.45 to 3.24); P = 0.0907]. Segmental BBPS score for the left and transverse colon were similar between treatment groups, but better for the right colon with PEG than OSS [2.2 (95% CI, 2.0-2.4) and 1.9 (95% CI, 1.7-2.1), respectively; P = 0.0015]. Significantly fewer OSS patients needed NGT placement to ingest the whole solution [9/125 (7.2%)] than PEG patients [36/116 (31.0%); P < 0.0001]. Treatment acceptability was significantly higher with OSS than PEG ( P < 0.0001). Duration of examination, completed colonoscopies, and time to cecal intubation were similar between preparations. Gastrointestinal AEs including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and distension were similar in both groups but more patients receiving PEG had AEs assessed as incapacitating. CONCLUSIONS: Non-inferiority of OSS to PEG was not demonstrated, but OSS was associated with a lower requirement for NGT, better acceptability, and less frequent severe AEs than with PEG.",0
Pretrichial Brow Lift.,"Patients commonly present with chief complaints of ""droopy eyes"" or similar phrases, but ""droopy eyes"" often mean different things. In many cases, the anatomical issue in question is upper eyelid dermatochalasis. Sometimes, there may also be pseudoherniated fat in the upper eyelid or even lacrimal gland ptosis. Blepharoptosis commonly occurs with age as well, but what patients frequently overlook is the contribution of brow ptosis to the appearance of aging in the periorbital area and to upper visual field deficits. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the surgeon to evaluate the periorbital area thoroughly and to identify which patients are candidates for brow lifting, which may or may not be performed in conjunction with upper eyelid surgery, and then further to determine the optimal approach for brow lifting in the individual patient. In this article, we discuss the pretrichial brow lift approach, its benefits, and its limitations. Since the first description of surgical brow lifting by Passot in 1919, myriad techniques have evolved to improve results. The traditional coronal approach was the first of the modern approaches developed in 1926 and was followed shortly thereafter by trichophytic and pretrichial variants. Direct, midforehead, temporal, endoscopic, and transblepharoplasty approaches followed over the ensuing 70 years. As technology in facial plastic surgery has advanced and the focus has shifted towards minimally invasive procedures, endoscopic and transblepharoplasty techniques have gained popularity over open approaches. However, the coronal incision and its variants are still commonly employed in the following situations: Revision brow lifting after minimally invasive surgery that did not produce the desired result. Advancing the frontal hairline while simultaneously performing a brow lift for aging face indications. Advancing the frontal hairline while providing access for frontal cranioplasty in gender affirmation surgery for transgender females. Accessing the frontal sinus, naso-orbito-ethmoid (NOE) region, brain, or anterior skull base for post-traumatic reconstruction or oncologic resection. Accessing the frontal pericranium for the development of an osteoplastic flap. The choice of approach between coronal and pretrichial/trichophytic depends on whether any adjustment to the frontal hairline is necessary. A traditional coronal approach across the vertex of the scalp will elevate the hairline commensurately with the width of the scalp strip excised. Pretrichial/trichophytic approaches tend not to elevate the hairline and may even be used to lower it, if necessary. The choice between pretrichial and trichophytic approaches is generally based on surgeon and patient preference. The pretrichial approach places the incision directly anterior to the hairline, whereas the trichophytic approach runs a few millimeters posterior to the hairline in order to hide the scar. In some cases, such as for hairline adjustment, the incision may run partially anterior to the hairline and partially within it.",0
Exercise Therapy for Knee and Hip Osteoarthritis: Is There An Ideal Prescription?,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Exercise therapy is the first line treatment for patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) but is consistently underutilized. In this review, we aim to provide health care professionals with an overview of the latest evidence in the areas of exercise therapy for OA, which can serve as a guide for incorporating the ideal exercise therapy prescription in the overall management plan for their patients with OA. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence continues to be produced supporting the use of exercise therapy for all patients with knee or hip OA. Ample evidence exists suggesting exercise therapy is a safe form of treatment, for both joint structures and the patient overall. Several systematic reviews show that exercise therapy is likely to improve patient outcomes, regardless of disease severity or comorbidities. However, no single type of exercise therapy is superior to others. SUMMARY: Health care practitioners and patients should be encouraged to incorporate exercise therapy into treatment plans and can be assured of the safety profile and likelihood of improvement in important patient outcomes. Since no single exercise therapy program shows vastly superior benefit, patient preference and contextual factors should be central to the shared decision-making process when selecting and individualising appropriate exercise therapy prescriptions.",0
Using a discrete choice experiment to elicit patients' preferences and willingness-to-pay for knee osteoarthritis treatments in Thailand.,"Osteoarthritis is the most common type of joint disease among elderly patients around the world. In response to the need for patient-centered care, patients' and physicians' preferences for knee osteoarthritis treatments have been studied in multiple countries, but not in Thailand. The objective of this study was to investigate Thai patients' preferences and their willingness to pay (WTP) for knee osteoarthritis treatments by using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). Six knee osteoarthritis treatment attributes, including pain relief, delayed disease progression, gastrointestinal side effects, kidney side effects, cardiovascular side effects, and cost, were used to develop a paper-based, DCE questionnaire survey. Patients with knee osteoarthritis, who were at least 18 years old and who provided written informed consent, were recruited from the orthopedic department in a tertiary care hospital in Thailand via convenience sampling. The conditional logit model was used to determine patients' preferences and WTP. The Institutional Review Board at Chulalongkorn University approved this study before it started. A total of 232 patients were collected and analyzed in this study. Patients preferred treatments with a higher efficacy (pain relief and delayed disease progression), a lower probability of side effects (gastrointestinal, kidney, and cardiovascular side effects), and a lower cost. Regarding efficacy and side effects, the patients weighted the importance of a 1% change in cardiovascular side effects (- 0.08) more heavily than 1% changes in kidney (- 0.07) and gastrointestinal (- 0.02) side effects, delayed disease progression (0.02), and pain relief (0.01). Patients were willing to pay 29.56 Thai Baht (THB) and 41.84 THB per month for every 1% increase in pain relief and delayed disease progression, respectively. Conversely, patients were willing to pay 52.04 THB, 145.18 THB and 164.23 THB per month for every 1% decrease in gastrointestinal, kidney, and cardiovascular side effects, respectively. In conclusion, pain relief, delayed disease progression, gastrointestinal side effects, kidney side effects, cardiovascular side effects, and the cost of treatment were significant factors among patients undergoing knee osteoarthritis treatment. Additionally, patients had a higher WTP for delayed disease progression than pain relief and a higher WTP for a reduced probability of cardiovascular side effects than gastrointestinal and kidney side effects. These findings could be used to support treatment decisions for knee osteoarthritis patients in Thailand.",1
"Who Gets to Determine Whether Home Is ""Unsafe"" at the End of Life?","BACKGROUND: At the end of life, some patients wish to be discharged directly home from the hospital, but health care teams may consider this unsafe, raising concerns for capacity and risk. However, defining risk is subjective and impacted by values, preferences, and clinical status. Accommodating patient preferences in discharge destinations can promote autonomy, dignity, and quality of life at the end of life. OBSERVATIONS: We developed a risk assessment framework to help clinicians objectively identify risk factors and protective factors and develop a comprehensive discharge plan. We applied this framework to a veteran nearing the end of life and he was able to successfully return home from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Approaching end-of-life discharges with a framework can inform discharge planning and lessen the risk of adverse events. Importantly, this framework can help clinicians communicate better and partner with patients and their loved ones in prioritizing patient values and preferences.",0
"Keeping It ""Current"": A Review of Treatment Options for the Management of Supraventricular Tachycardia.","OBJECTIVE: To review treatment options and updates that exist for the management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). DATA SOURCES: A literature search of PubMed was performed including articles from 1974 to June 2023 using the terms: arrhythmias, adenosine, verapamil, diltiazem, esmolol, propranolol, metoprolol, beta-blockers, amiodarone, PSVT, synchronized cardioversion, methylxanthines, dipyridamole, pediatrics, heart transplant, and pregnancy. Primary literature and guidelines were reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were considered if they were available in English and conducted in humans. DATA SYNTHESIS: PSVT is a subset of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that presents as a rapid, regular tachycardia with an abrupt onset and termination. Due to frequent emergency department (ED) visits annually with symptoms of PSVT, appropriate and efficient management of these patients is vital. This review provides an overview of the pathophysiology of PSVT, while also describing the literature behind nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of PSVT. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review describes new literature regarding the improved success of the modified Valsalva maneuver as a nonpharmacologic therapy in PSVT. In addition, it describes a new technique in administration of adenosine that has improved outcomes, defines dose adjustments needed for drug interactions with adenosine, compares the utilization of nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with adenosine, and provides management recommendations for patients in special populations. CONCLUSIONS: With high annual rates of ED visits for SVT, providers should be aware of the data behind management and modifications of therapy based on patient-specific factors (ie, patient preference, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, drug interactions, and special populations).",0
Individualized Net Benefit estimation and meta-analysis using generalized pairwise comparisons in N-of-1 trials.,"BACKGROUND: The Net Benefit (Δ) is a measure of the benefit-risk balance in clinical trials, based on generalized pairwise comparisons (GPC) using several prioritized outcomes and thresholds of clinical relevance. We extended Δ to N-of-1 trials, with a focus on patient-level and population-level Δ. METHODS: We developed a Δ estimator at the individual level as an extension of the stratum-specific Δ, and at the population-level as an extension of the stratified Δ. We performed a simulation study mimicking PROFIL, a series of 38 N-of-1 trials testing sildenafil in Raynaud's phenomenon, to assess the power for such an analysis with realistic data. We then reanalyzed PROFIL using GPC. This reanalysis was finally interpreted in the context of the main analysis of PROFIL which used Bayesian individual probabilities of efficacy. RESULTS: Simulations under the null showed good size of the test for both individual and population levels. The test lacked power when being simulated from the true PROFIL data, even when increasing the number of repetitions up to 140 days per patient. PROFIL individual-level estimated Δ were well correlated with the probabilities of efficacy from the Bayesian analysis while showing similarly wide confidence intervals. Population-level estimated Δ was not significantly different from zero, consistently with the previous Bayesian analysis. CONCLUSION: GPC can be used to estimate individual Δ which can then be aggregated in a meta-analytic way in N-of-1 trials. GPC ability to easily incorporate patient preferences allow for more personalized treatment evaluation, while needing much less computing time than Bayesian modeling.",0
The Role of Web-Based Adaptive Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis Technology in Eliciting Patients' Preferences for Osteoarthritis Treatment.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of using adaptive choice-based conjoint (ACBC) analysis to elicit patients' preferences for pharmacological treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), patients' satisfaction with completing the ACBC questionnaire, and factors associated with questionnaire completion time. METHODS: Adult patients aged 18 years and older with a medical diagnosis of OA, experiencing joint pain in the past 12 months, and living in the Northeast of England participated in the study. The participants completed a web-based ACBC questionnaire about their preferences regarding pharmaceutical treatment for OA using a touchscreen laptop independently, and accordingly, the questionnaire completion time was measured. Moreover, the participants completed a pen-and-paper feedback form about their experience in completing the ACBC questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty participants aged 40 years and older, 65% females, 75% had knee OA, and suffering from OA for more than 5 years participated in the study. About 60% of participants reported completing a computerized questionnaire in the past. About 85% of participants believed that the ACBC task helped them in making decisions regarding their OA medications, and 95% agreed or strongly agreed that they would be happy to complete a similar ACBC questionnaire in the future. The average questionnaire completion time was 16 min (range 10-24 min). The main factors associated with longer questionnaire completion time were older age, never using a computer in the past, and no previous experience in completing a questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: The ACBC analysis is a feasible and efficient method to elicit patients' preferences for pharmacological treatment of OA, which could be used in clinical settings to facilitate shared decision-making and patient-centered care. The ACBC questionnaire completion consumes a significantly longer time for elderly participants, who never used a computer, and never completed any questionnaire previously. Therefore, the contribution of patients and public involvement (PPI) group in the development of the ACBC questionnaire could facilitate participants' understanding and satisfaction with the task. Future research including patients with different chronic conditions may provide more useful information about the efficiency of ACBC analysis in eliciting patients' preferences for osteoarthritis treatment.",1
The effect of virtual reality glasses on dental anxiety during scaling and root planing in patients with periodontitis: A randomized controlled clinical trial.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of virtual reality distraction (VRD) on dental anxiety during scaling and root planing (SRP) in periodontitis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled split-mouth study included 60 patients who scored 9 or above on the dental anxiety scale (DAS) and required SRP in at least two quadrants with at least five teeth and two sites with a probing depth of ≥4 mm. Randomly chosen quadrants were treated using virtual reality glasses, and other quadrants were treated without glasses at the same visit. During VRD, a video of nature scenes was projected onto the screen in front of the patient's eyes. DAS and a visual analogue scale about patient feelings were applied at the end of the procedure. RESULTS: With VRD, the scale value of pain and discomfort level (VASP) was significantly reduced (p = 0.01, d = 0.57). Starting treatment without glasses significantly decreased VASP in both control and test sides (p = 0.00, d = 0.85; p = 0.00, d = 0.80, respectively) and increased the sensation of immersion and realism (p = 0.03, d = 0.45; p = 0.02, d = 0.46, respectively). Intraoperative and postoperative DAS values were significantly lower in patients who started treatment without VRD (p = 0.04, d = 0.34; p = 0.02, d = 0.44, respectively). Of the patients, 63.3% preferred VRD in the subsequent treatment. While patient preference did not correlate with sex, it correlated with age (r = -0.48, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The VRD and initiating SRP procedure with VRD affected the pain and discomfort level in anxious periodontitis patients. In addition, the anxiety level was also affected by starting the procedure with glasses.",0
Viewpoint: Nurses educating patients about drugs.,"Educating patients about the drugs they take is essential for them to take them safely and effectively. This education is now commonly given by nurses as part of the huge expansion in the nurse specialist role. However, training for this role has not kept pace with practice. Nurses have expressed variable confidence in this role and expressed a wish for more formal training. Current practice often puts the information rather than the patient at the centre of the consultation with the nurse dominating the conversation. Cues to address the patient agenda are commonly missed. An animated patient who interrupts is probably not having their educational needs met. Education of the professionals around how to perform this task in an optimal way is necessary and should result in better efficacy and safety of the drugs. This could be achieved by incorporating features of Shared Decision Making and the Calgary-Cambridge consultation techniques into training and the consultation. Personalisation by attention to patient preferences, language and health literacy is essential.",0
A Preference-Based Value Assessment of the Fear of COVID-19 Contagion.,"PURPOSE: To assess the preference-based value of the fear of COVID-19 contagion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a web-based, cross-sectional discrete choice experiment among 544 US adults. We used a Bayesian efficient design to generate choice sets. Each choice set comprised two hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine options characterized by seven attributes: chance of COVID-19 infection, chance of having severe symptoms from COVID-19 infection, vaccine protection duration, chance of mild to moderate adverse events from vaccination, chance of serious adverse events from vaccination, chance of future exposure to COVID-19 after vaccination, and out-of-pocket cost. We used mixed logit (ML) and latent class (LC) models to analyze data. Furthermore, we calculated the willingness-to-pay for eliminating the chance of future exposure to COVID-19, shedding light on the value attributed to the fear of contagion. RESULTS: The ML model demonstrated all attributes, including the chance of future exposure to COVID-19, were statistically significant. The participants were willing to pay approximately $13,046 to eliminate the chance of future exposure to COVID-19 or their fear of contagion when COVID-19 was still pandemic. The LC model unveiled two participant classes with distinct preference weights for the chance of future exposure to COVID-19 and out-of-pocket cost attributes. Nevertheless, the chance of future exposure to COVID-19 exposure held a significant degree of importance in both classes. CONCLUSION: The chance of future exposure to COVID-19 exposure or fear of contagion was a significant element in the value assessment of COVID-19 vaccines. Further studies should be conducted to verify the value of fear of contagion and include it in the value assessment of healthcare technologies for infectious diseases.",1
Dietetic advocacy for long-term use of exclusive enteral nutrition resulted in high-risk surgical avoidance for complicated fibrotic Crohn's disease - A case report.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Surgery is often the only therapeutic option for the management of fibrotic Crohn's disease (FCD). Exclusive Enteral Nutrition (EEN), a nutritionally complete liquid formula, is an effective, safe, short-term treatment for Crohn's Disease. No cases were found internationally of adults with FCD on long-term EEN. We report on clinical outcomes and self-reported quality of life (QoL) after longer-term EEN provision in a patient with complex FCD. METHODS: ""Billie"", a 54-year-old female, was admitted with ileal FCD diagnosed in 1985. Previous treatments were unsuccessful, including multiple bowel resections. Billie was chronically bedbound with pain and depression. CDAI (Crohn's disease activity index) score was 640 (<150) with ∼3-20 liquid stools/day, and recurrent partial bowel obstructions. Radiological findings were so severe surgeons reluctantly considered surgery but ""one more resection will result in short bowel syndrome"". Billie trialled EEN given her QoL was ""non-existent"". Unable to tolerate the taste, EEN was administered via nasogastric tube. After two months, EEN was administered ongoing via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy given patient preference and dietetic advocacy. RESULTS: After eight weeks on EEN, Billie's pain predominantly resolved, with bowel motions of ∼1-2/day, and nil bowel obstructions. Twelve months after EEN commencement, Billie's CDAI was 52, with 'no indication for surgical intervention' and was self-reporting that ""life is good"". After 18 months, Billie remains asymptomatic, and in clinical remission. CONCLUSION: This unique case is a wonderful example of dietetic advocacy and showcases the positive impact long-term EEN may have on surgical avoidance, clinical outcomes and self-reported QoL.",0
Contextual community epinephrine prescribing: Is more always better?,"OBJECTIVE: Prompt administration of epinephrine is first-line management of anaphylaxis. Although severe anaphylaxis may require more than 1 epinephrine dose, multiple epinephrine device packs may not be necessary for all patients at risk for allergic reactions. DATA SOURCES: A narrative review was used to describe key considerations to contextualize community epinephrine prescribing. RESULTS: Anaphylaxis has a lifetime prevalence of 1.6% to 5.1%. Meeting diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis is not required for epinephrine treatment of a severe allergic reaction. A ""1-2-3"" approach to anaphylaxis treatment is important to clearly relay central management steps: promptly administer a first dose of intramuscular epinephrine with proper positioning, and activate emergency medical services if immediate symptom resolution does not occur; consider a second dose of intramuscular epinephrine with consideration of oxygen administration and intravenous fluid if initial epinephrine response is not adequate; and consider a third intramuscular epinephrine dose together with consideration of intravenous fluid support and oxygen for continued lack of appropriate response. Although multiple epinephrine doses may be required to treat severe anaphylaxis, 90% of anaphylaxis cases do not require more than 1 epinephrine dose. A universal requirement for multiple epinephrine devices in patients without a history of anaphylaxis is not cost-effective. Patients without a history of anaphylaxis may be managed without multiple device prescriptions within a patient-preference sensitive paradigm of care. CONCLUSION: Anaphylaxis prevention involves appropriate education to avoid allergen triggers, recognize symptoms of an allergic reaction, rapidly access and administer intramuscular epinephrine, and appropriately activate emergency medical services when needed. For patients with previous anaphylaxis, particularly those who have required more than 1 dose of epinephrine to treat an allergic reaction, possessing multiple epinephrine devices is an important part of managing community anaphylaxis risk.",0
Ordering Eyeglasses Using 3D Head Scan Technology versus Established Online and Storefront Clinic Methods.,"SIGNIFICANCE: This study investigates how a new smartphone scanning technology compares with established online and storefront vendors in providing remote measurement and adjustment of prescription eyeglasses. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate a new technology for ordering prescription eyeglasses online. METHODS: Thirty participants with 2.00 to 2.75 D of presbyopia (aged 49 to 74 years) were asked to order eyeglasses with progressive addition lenses from four vendors: one online vendor using a new head scan technology (Topology, San Francisco, CA), two established Web site-based vendors (vendors A and B), and one storefront vendor: Université de Montréal's Vision Clinic (UMVC). The resulting measurements were compared with those of opticians. Participant-reported preferences on visual and physical comfort of eyeglasses were collected after 15-minute trials of eyeglasses from each vendor. RESULTS: Pupillary half-distance measured with Topology matched optician measurements, but online vendors A and B diverged (mean difference, - 0.80 mm [ Z = -2.79; P = .005]). Topology and vendor B segment addition heights were similar to optician measurements, but vendor A diverged (mean, -1.40 mm [ Z = -2.58; P = .01]). The personalization parameter values obtained with Topology were different from optician measurements for pantoscopic angle (-5.30° [ Z = -4.12; P < .001]) and face wrap angle (+1.25° [ Z = -2.94; P = .003]). The UMVC eyeglasses scored best for adjustment (8.71/10 [ Z = -5.53; P < .001]), with Topology coming second (7.23/10). Topology scores were equivalent to UMVC scores for all eight items of patient-reported preferences (nonparametric Friedman analysis of variance, P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Basic lens centration measurements obtained with Topology compare well with those of opticians, but some aspects of the methodology for measuring personalization parameters could be improved. In comparison with two established online vendors, resulting measurements with Topology are more consistent. Initial wearer satisfaction with Topology eyeglasses was also better.",0
Effectiveness of digital care platform CMyLife for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia: results of a patient-preference trial.,"BACKGROUND: Two most important factors determining treatment success in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are adequate medication compliance and molecular monitoring albeit still being suboptimal. The CMyLife platform is an eHealth innovation, co-created with and for CML patients, aiming to improve their care, leading to an increased quality of life and the opportunity of hospital-free care. OBJECTIVE: To explore the effectiveness of CMyLife in terms of information provision, patient empowerment, medication compliance, molecular monitoring, and quality of life. METHODS: Effectiveness of CMyLife was explored using a patient-preference trial. Upon completion of the baseline questionnaire, participants actively used (intervention group) or did not actively use (questionnaire group) the CMyLife platform for at least 6 months, after which they completed the post-intervention questionnaire. Scores between the intervention group and the questionnaire group were compared with regard to the within-subject change between baseline and post-measurement using Generalized Estimating Equation models. RESULTS: At baseline, 33 patients were enrolled in the questionnaire group and 75 in the intervention group. Online health information knowledge improved significantly when actively using CMyLife and patients felt more empowered. No significant improvements were found regarding medication compliance and molecular monitoring, which were already outstanding. Self-reported effectiveness showed that patients experienced that using CMyLife improved their medication compliance and helped them to oversee their molecular monitoring. Patients using CMyLife reported more symptoms but were better able to manage these. CONCLUSIONS: Since hospital-free care has shown to be feasible in time of the COVID-19 pandemic, eHealth-based innovations such as CMyLife could be a solution to maintain the quality of care and make current oncological health care services more sustainable.

Using Discrete Choice Experiments to Quantify Patient Preferences.,"Discrete choice experiments are a robust technique for quantifying preferences. With this method, respondents are presented with a series of hypothetical comparisons described by attributes with varying levels. The aggregated choices from respondents can be used to infer the relative importance of the described attributes and acceptable trade-offs between attributes. The data generated from discrete choice experiments can aid surgeons in aligning patient values with treatment decisions and support the design of research that is responsive to patient preferences. This article summarizes the application of discrete choice experiments to orthopaedics. We share best practices for designing discrete choice experiments and options for reporting study results. Finally, we suggest opportunities for this method within our field.",1
Shifting quality chronic pain treatment measures from processes to outcomes.,"OBJECTIVE: Misapplication of the 2016 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) opioid prescribing guidelines has led to overem-phasis of morphineequivalent daily dose (MEDD) as a ""metric of success"" in chronic noncancer pain (CNCP), resulting in unintentional harms to patients. This article reviews CNCP-related guidelines and patient preferences in order to identify pragmatic, patient-centered metrics to assess treatment response and safety in opioid-treated CNCP. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical (CDC), research (Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials), and implementability-related guidelines (GuideLine Implementability Appraisal), along with relevant patient-identified treatment goals. From these, we summarize a guideline-concordant, patient-centered, implementable set of measures to aid the clinical management of opioid-treated CNCP. RESULTS: We identify metrics across three domains of care: (1) treatment response metrics, which align with the CNCP care goals (pain intensity, pain interference including function and quality of life, and global impression of change); (2) risk assessment (""safety"") metrics, eg, MEDD, benzodiazepine-opioid or naloxone-opioid coprescribing, and severity of mental health disorders, which evaluate the risk-benefit profile of opioid therapy; and (3) adherence (""process"") metrics, which assess clinician/patient adherence to the guideline-recommended opioid therapy monitoring practices, eg, the presence of completed treatment agreement or urine toxicology testing. All metrics should be informed by implementability principles, eg, be decidable, executable, and measurable. CONCLUSIONS: This article summarizes guideline-concordant, patient-centered, implementable metrics for assessing treatment response, safety, and adherence in opioid-treated CNCP. Regardless of which specific treatment guidelines are applied, this approach could help conceptualize and standardize the collection and reporting of CNCP-relevant metrics, compare them across health systems, and optimize care and treatment outcomes in opioid-treated CNCP.",0
Surgeon preference for treatment allocation in older people facing major gastrointestinal surgery: an application of the discrete choice experiment methodology.,"AIM: Variation in major gastrointestinal surgery rates in the older population suggests heterogeneity in surgical management. A higher prevalence of comorbidities, frailty and cognitive impairments in the older population may account for some variation. The aim of this study was to determine surgeon preference for major surgery versus conservative management in hypothetical patient scenarios based on key attributes. METHOD: A survey was designed according to the discrete choice methodology guided by a separate qualitative study. Questions were designed to test for associations between key attributes (age, comorbidity, urgency of presentation, pathology, functional and cognitive status) and treatment preference for major gastrointestinal surgery versus conservative management. The survey consisting of 18 hypothetical scenarios was disseminated electronically to UK gastrointestinal surgeons. Binomial logistic regression was used to identify associations between the attributes and treatment preference. RESULTS: In total, 103 responses were received after 256 visits to the questionnaire site (response rate 40.2%). Participants answered 1847 out of the 1854 scenarios (99.6%). There was a preference for major surgery in 1112/1847 (60.2%) of all scenarios. Severe comorbidities (OR 0.001, 95% CI 0.000-0.030; P = 0.000), severe cognitive impairment (OR 0.001, 95% CI 0.000-0.033; P = 0.000) and age 85 years and above (OR 0.028, 95% CI 0.005-0.168; P = 0.000) were all significant in the decision not to offer major gastrointestinal surgery. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated variation in surgical treatment preference according to key attributes in hypothetical scenarios. The development of fitness-stratified guidelines may help to reduce variation in surgical practice in the older population.",0
Vaginal dryness: a review of current understanding and management strategies.,"The issue of vaginal dryness in genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and its pervasive impact on women's quality of life is often overlooked. Extensive surveys conducted worldwide reveal limited understanding of vaginal dryness among public and health-care providers. Physician knowledge on menopause medicine varies globally, highlighting the need for standardized training. Effective communication between physicians and patients plays a crucial role in diagnosing and treating GSM symptoms. There are multiple treatment options to improve vaginal lubrication, including hormonal and non-hormonal therapies, along with lifestyle modifications. Tailoring treatments to individual patient preferences is crucial for compliance. Overall, GSM is multifaceted, from the prevalence of vaginal dryness to the nuances of treatment preferences. The urgency of widespread education and awareness of this matter must be underscored to meet the aim of enhancing the well-being and quality of life for women.",0
Interprofessional education for shared decision making in drug therapy: a scoping review.,"The current complex scenario of medication use calls for the implementation of interprofessional education (IPE) initiatives focused on shared decision making (SDM) in drug therapy. A scoping review was conducted to collate, summarize, and report the evidence available on IPE teaching and learning approaches in this context, involving pre-licensure healthcare students. Searches were conducted in seven electronic databases, with 21 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. This review examines educational strategies employed for interprofessional SDM as well as characteristics of students, teachers, and tutors involved in IPE interventions. The reviewed studies lack detailed description of the students' decision-making process, and none addresses aspects related to patient preferences as a part of learning outcomes. We identified shortcomings in how IPE interventions are assessed and reported. Only a few of the studies explicitly describe the use of competency-based frameworks proposed by national and international organizations, and less than 60% describe learning outcomes. The absence of experiences focused on interprofessional SDM in drug therapy suggests a gap that needs to be addressed with future studies evaluated in a robust way. We argue that such experiences enable students, as a team, to learn to share decisions with the patient as an effective team member.",0
Effect of standardised surgical assessment and shared decision-making on morbidity and patient satisfaction after breast conserving therapy: A cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: The role of oncoplastic breast conserving therapy (OPBCT) on physical function, morbidity and patient satisfaction has yet to be defined. Additionally, technique selection should be individualised and incorporate patient preference. The study aim was to investigate differences between ""standard"" (sBCT) and oncoplastic breast conservation (OPBCT) in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) when patients have been assessed in a standardised manner and technique selection has been reached through shared decision-making (SDM). METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study of 215 women treated at a tertiary referral centre. Standardised surgical assessment included breast and lesion volumetry, definition of resection ratio, patient-related risk factors and patient preference. Postoperative morbidity and patient satisfaction were assessed by validated PROs tools (Diseases of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand-DASH and Breast-Q). Patient experience was assessed by semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: There was no difference of the median values between OPBCT and sBCT in postoperative morbidity of the upper extremity (DASH 3.3 vs 5, p = 0.656) or the function of the chest wall (Breast-Q 82 vs 82, p = 0.758). Postoperative satisfaction with breasts did not differ either (Breast-Q 65 vs 61, p = 0.702). On the individual level, women that opted for OPBCT after SDM had improved satisfaction when compared to baseline (+3 vs -1, p = 0.001). Shared decision-making changed patient attitude in 69.8% of patients, leading most often to de-escalation from mastectomy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support that a combination of standardised surgical assessment and SDM allows for tailored treatment and de-escalation of oncoplastic surgery without negatively affecting patient satisfaction and morbidity.",0
Telehealth adoption in cancer clinical trials: An Australian perspective.,"INTRODUCTION: Cancer clinical trials have traditionally occurred in-person. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced adaptions of all aspects of cancer care (including clinical trials) so they can be delivered remotely. We aimed to quantify and qualify current use of telehealth and how it can be further improved and routinely integrated into cancer clinical trials in Australia. METHODS: We used a mixed-method study design, involving surveys of 14 multi-site Collaborative Cancer Clinical Trial Groups members across Australia (n = 98) and qualitative interviews with trial administrators and clinicians (n = 21). RESULTS: The results of our study indicated a strong willingness to use telehealth for certain transactions of clinical trials because it was perceived as a way of increasing efficiency and reach of services. Hybrid models (including telehealth and in-person methods), which considered transaction, cancer type, and patient preferences were most favorable. Additionally, telehealth allowed for greater equity to access and reduced trial burden but interestingly had little effect on increased diversity and recruitment. Factors influencing telehealth service implementation and uptake included communication among trial stakeholders, training, and learning from the experience of others in the clinical trials community. CONCLUSION: Many but not all aspects of clinical trial care are appropriate to be delivered via telehealth. A hybrid approach provides flexibility to trial delivery and may support greater equity of access to trials in the future. Our findings and actionable recommendations support the need for greater planning, training, and guidelines to enable telehealth to be better integrated into clinical trials. Opportunities exist to expand the use of remote patient monitoring to enable more objective data collection from trial participants in the future.",0
Artificial Intelligence in Health Care-Understanding Patient Information Needs and Designing Comprehensible Transparency: Qualitative Study.,"BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) is as a branch of computer science that uses advanced computational methods such as machine learning (ML), to calculate and/or predict health outcomes and address patient and provider health needs. While these technologies show great promise for improving healthcare, especially in diabetes management, there are usability and safety concerns for both patients and providers about the use of AI/ML in healthcare management. OBJECTIVES: To support and ensure safe use of AI/ML technologies in healthcare, the team worked to better understand: 1) patient information and training needs, 2) the factors that influence patients' perceived value and trust in AI/ML healthcare applications; and 3) on how best to support safe and appropriate use of AI/ML enabled devices and applications among people living with diabetes. METHODS: To understand general patient perspectives and information needs related to the use of AI/ML in healthcare, we conducted a series of focus groups (n=9) and interviews (n=3) with patients (n=40) and interviews with providers (n=6) in Alaska, Idaho, and Virginia. Grounded Theory guided data gathering, synthesis, and analysis. Thematic content and constant comparison analysis were used to identify relevant themes and sub-themes. Inductive approaches were used to link data to key concepts including preferred patient-provider-interactions, patient perceptions of trust, accuracy, value, assurances, and information transparency. RESULTS: Key summary themes and recommendations focused on: 1) patient preferences for AI/ML enabled device and/or application information; 2) patient and provider AI/ML-related device and/or application training needs; 3) factors contributing to patient and provider trust in AI/ML enabled devices and/or application; and 4) AI/ML-related device and/or application functionality and safety considerations. A number of participant (patients and providers) recommendations to improve device functionality to guide information and labeling mandates (e.g., links to online video resources, and access to 24/7 live in-person or virtual emergency support). Other patient recommendations include: 1) access to practice devices; 2) connection to local supports and reputable community resources; 3) simplified display and alert limits. CONCLUSION: Recommendations from both patients and providers could be used by Federal Oversight Agencies to improve utilization of AI/ML monitoring of technology use in diabetes, improving device safety and efficacy.",0
"Effectiveness and Safety of Bu Shen Kai Qiao Fang in the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: Study Protocol for a Multicenter, Prospective, Real-World Clinical Trial.","BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common degenerative disease of the nervous system with serious impact on quality of life of patients and their families. With an aging population, AD has become a major public health problem in China and worldwide. However, the physiological and pathological mechanisms of AD have not been fully elucidated, and there is a lack of effective prevention and clinical treatment methods. Many studies have found that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a good therapeutic effect on cognitive function in AD patients. Bu Shen Kai Qiao Fang (BSKQF) is one such Chinese herbal preparation used in the treatment of AD. We designed a protocol for a real-world clinical study of BSKQF combined with Donepezil hydrochloride (DH) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this approach in the treatment of AD patients. METHODS: This is a protocol for a real-world, multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study. The study will recruit 860 AD patients from four hospitals across China. Equal numbers of patients will be treated with BSKQF and DH or with DH only. The criteria for grouping are based primarily on patient preference. Outcome measures include scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MOCA) and will be recorded at baseline, and at one, two and three months after enrollment. The plasma Aβ42 and plasma Tau levels of participating patients will also be measured by ELISA at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. Safety metrics and adverse events (AEs) of participating patients will be monitored and recorded. DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of BSKQF in the treatment of AD. The results will provide reliable evidence for the clinical application of BSKQF in the treatment of AD. STUDY REGISTRATION: Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, NO.

Personalizing prevention: Advances in pharmacotherapy for HIV prevention.,"The HIV epidemic continues to pose a significant burden on the healthcare system. Although the incidence of annual new infections is decreasing, health disparities persist and most new infections remain concentrated into different racial, ethnic, and minority groups. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which involves those at high risk of acquiring HIV to take chronic medications to prevent acquisition of the virus, is key to preventing new HIV infections. The purpose of this article is to review medication therapies for PrEP and examine their role in personalizing PrEP in different patient populations. Additionally, new medications currently under development for PrEP are reviewed, as well as treatment as prevention (TasP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). There are currently four medications available for PrEP: the oral options of co-formulated emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) or emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF); injectable long-acting cabotegravir (CAB-LA); and the vaginal ring dapivirine (DPV-VR). FTC/TAF is not currently indicated for persons at risk for HIV through vaginal sex due to lack of studies, but trials are currently ongoing. DPV-VR is available in Zimbabwe and South Africa and has been endorsed by the World Health Organization but is not currently available in the United States. Several agents are also in development for use in PrEP: the novel long-acting injectable lenacapavir, a first-in-class capsid inhibitor, which has no cross-resistance to any existing HIV drug class; the subdermal implant islatravir, a first-in-class translocation inhibitor; and VRC01, a broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) which has been evaluated in proof-of-concept studies that may lead to the development of more potent bnAbs. Overall, PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV infection in high-risk populations. Identifying optimal PrEP regimens in different patient populations is complex and must consider patient-specific factors and medication cost and access considerations. Lastly, providers should consider individual patient preferences with regard to prevention to improve access, retention in care, and adherence.",0
Current Health State Affected Patient Preferences More Than Disease Status: A Discrete Choice Experiment in Multiple Myeloma.,"OBJECTIVES: To examine how disease status and current health state influence treatment preferences of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). METHODS: Participants with MM from France, Germany, and the United Kingdom completed a web-based survey that included a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and EQ-5D assessment. The DCE elicited preferences for 8 attributes: increased life expectancy, increased time to relapse, pain, fatigue, risk of infection, administration (route and duration), frequency of administration, and monitoring. Multinomial logit models were used to analyze DCE preference data and to calculate life expectancy trade-offs. RESULTS: Three hundred participants with MM (newly diagnosed, transplant eligible, n = 108; newly diagnosed, transplant ineligible, n = 105; relapsed-refractory, n = 87) completed the survey. The most valued attributes were pain, fatigue, and increased life expectancy. Participants would want an additional 2.7 years of life expectancy (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4-3.1 years) to tolerate extreme pain and an additional 2.0 years of life expectancy (95% CI 1.6-2.3 years) to tolerate constant fatigue. Participants in a better health state (third EQ-5D score quartile [0.897]) required less additional life expectancy than participants with a worse health state (first EQ-5D score quartile [0.662]) to tolerate extreme pain (2.3 years [95% CI 1.9-2.6 years] vs 3.0 years [95% CI 2.6-3.4 years]; P = .007). There was little difference in treatment preferences between newly diagnosed and relapsed-refractory patients for pain, fatigue, and increased life expectancy. CONCLUSIONS: Current health state influenced treatment preferences of patients with MM more than disease status and should be considered when making treatment decisions.",1
Subcutaneous immunoglobulin for patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: a real-world single centre experience.,"OBJECTIVES: Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) are heterogeneous diseases characterized by skeletal muscle inflammation associated with cutaneous, pulmonary, and/or other visceral organ involvement. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been recommended as an adjunct therapy for IIM patients refractory to conventional therapy. However, IVIG has high resource needs and increased risk of adverse reactions. Subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) therapy has been used as an alternative to IVIG in primary immunodeficiencies and neuroinflammatory disorders. We assessed the satisfaction, patient preference and effectiveness in IIM patients transitioned from IVIG to SCIG. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive 20 patients with IIM who were transitioned from IVIG to SCIG therapy for >12 months. Patient preference between IVIG vs SCIG was surveyed using a questionnaire previously used in studies with neuroinflammatory conditions. In addition, disease flares, changes in immunosuppression, cumulative prednisone doses and global disease activity were evaluated using the Myositis Intention to Treat Index (MITAX) 12-months prior to- and post-SCIG initiation. RESULTS: Most patients (78.9%) preferred SCIG over IVIG and preferred home-based therapies to hospital-based therapies. There was no significant difference in global disease activity (MITAX 3.31 vs 3.02) nor in cumulative steroid doses 12-months prior to- or post-SCIG initiation. Three patients experienced disease flares, 5 escalated in immunosuppression, while 4 patients deescalated in immunosuppressive medications. CONCLUSIONS: SCIG is preferred by most patients over IVIG without a substantial increased disease activity or need for additional corticosteroids. Future cost effectiveness studies may provide an additional rationale for utilizing SCIG over IVIG for maintenance therapy for IIM.",0
Quantifying preferences for urea cycle disorder treatments using a discrete choice experiment.,"AIMS: Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) can cause ammonia accumulation and central nervous system toxicity. Nitrogen-binding medications can be efficacious, but certain attributes may negatively impact adherence. This study sought to quantify the administration-related attributes influencing overall prescription selection and patient adherence. METHODS: A web-based, quantitative survey including discrete choice experiment (DCE) methodology captured responses from health care providers for patients with UCDs. A series of hypothetical treatment profile sets with attributes such as route of administration, taste/odor, preparation instructions, packaging, dose measurement, and weight use restrictions were presented. From 16 sets of 3 hypothetical product profiles, respondents evaluated attributes most preferred for prescription selection or patient adherence. Attributes assumed a higher overall preference if relative importance (RI) scores were >16.67% (the value if all attributes were of equal importance). Preference weight scores were assessed. A nine-point Likert scale assessed respondent attitudes, such as satisfaction. RESULTS: A total of 51 respondents completed the survey. Respondents reported dissatisfaction with current treatments (mean [SD] = 5.4 [1.7]). For prescription selection, four attributes achieved RI >16.67%: taste/odor (24%), weight restrictions (21%), preparation instructions (18%), and route of administration (17%). For adherence, three attributes related to administration achieved RI >16.67%: taste/odor (28%), preparation instructions (21%), and route of administration (17%). Preference weights for ""taste/odor masked"" were higher than ""not taste/odor masked"" for prescription selection (mean [SD]; 1.52 [1.10] vs -1.52 [1.10]) and treatment adherence (73.8 [55.2] vs -73.8 [55.2]). LIMITATIONS: This study contained a relatively small sample size. Survey respondent selection, the use of hypothetical product profiles, and exclusion of non-pharmacologic treatment options could have contributed to potential biases. CONCLUSIONS: Among attributes tested, taste/odor was the most important attribute influencing overall preference for both prescribing and patient adherence, with taste/odor masking preferred. Optimizing nitrogen-binding medications through masking taste/odor may support improved patient adherence and outcomes in UCDs.",1
"A care substitution service in the Netherlands: impact on referral, cost, and patient satisfaction.","BACKGROUND: In care substitution services, medical specialists offer brief consultations to provide general practitioners (GPs) with advice on diagnosis, treatment, or hospital referral. When GPs serve as gatekeepers to secondary care, these regional services could reduce pressures on healthcare systems. The aim is to determine the impact of implementing a care substitution service for dermatology, orthopaedics, and cardiology on the hospital referral rate, health care costs, and patient satisfaction. METHODS: A before-after study was used to evaluate hospital referral rates and health care costs during a follow-up period of 1 year. The study population comprised patients with eligible International Classification of Primary Care codes for referral to the care substitution service (only dermatology, orthopaedic, cardiology indications), as pre-defined by GPs and medical specialists. We compared referral rates before and after implementation by χ(2) tests and evaluated patient preference by qualitative analysis. RESULTS: In total, 4,930 patients were included, 2,408 before and 2,522 after implementation. The care substitution service decreased hospital referrals during the follow-up period from 15 to 11%. The referral rate decreased most for dermatology (from 15 to 9%), resulting in a cost reduction of €10.59 per patient, while the other two specialisms experienced smaller reductions in referral rates. Patients reported being satisfied, mainly because of the null cost, improved organisation, improved care, and positive experience of the consultation. CONCLUSIONS: The care substitution service showed promise for specialisms that require fewer hospital facilities, as exemplified by dermatology.",0
Validation of the Korean Version of Patient-Centered Care Tool: For Outpatients.,"AIM: The objective of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of the Korean version of the patient-centered care (K-PCC) instrument for outpatients. The study was conducted due to the absence of a measurement tool specifically designed to evaluate patient-centered care for outpatients. DESIGN: This study is a methodological study to verify the validity and reliability of the Korean version of Patient-Centered Care (K-PCC) to measure patient-centeredness for outpatients. METHODS: As a first step for the evaluation of the tool, the content validity was verified by expert panel. Then, a total of 400 outpatients were recruited, and construct validity was verified through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) as the second step for the evaluation of the tool. The convergent and discriminant validity of the tool was verified by calculating the standardized factor loads, construct reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE), and calculating the correlation square between the factors as the third and fourth steps for the evaluation of the tool. And as a fifth step for the evaluation of the tool, criterion validity was evaluated by comparing the correlation with the patient-centeredness measurement tool for inpatients (PEx-inpatient). In estimating reliability, internal consistency reliability coefficients were calculated. RESULTS: The confirmatory factor analysis supported good fit for the Korean patient-centered care instrument (K-PCC), and the eight-factor structure was validated. The scale comprises 21 items across eight factors: patient preferences (4 items), physical comfort (2 items), coordination of care (2 items), continuity and transition (3 items), emotional support (2 items), access to medical care (3 items), information and education (2 items), and family and friends (3 items). The Cronbach's alphas ranging between 0.73 and 0.88. CONCLUSION: The Korean patient-centered primary care instrument is a valid and reliable scale to measure patient-centered care for outpatients in the Korean medical environment.",0
