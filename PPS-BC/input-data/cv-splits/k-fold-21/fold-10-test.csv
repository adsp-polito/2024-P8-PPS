Advance Care Planning in South Korea.,"South Korea is an Asian country with a very low birth rate and a large elderly population. Nearly half of deaths are in the elderly over the age of 80, and cancer is the leading cause of all deaths. As the aging population increases, interest in end-of-life (EOL) care and quality of death is growing, but South Korea is one of the Asian countries that traditionally feels burdened by discussing death openly. In particular, even when a person is suffering from an incurable disease and is about to die, it is customary for the family members to make decisions without directly informing the patient of the disease status or discussing life-sustaining treatment (LST). However, due to a series of social events, the importance of individual autonomy, good death, discontinuation of LSTs, and advance care planning (ACP) gradually spread, and eventually the Life-Sustaining Treatment Decisions Act was implemented in 2018. With the enactment of this law, patients' autonomy was enhanced in a short period of time, and a legal basis was established to discontinue LST at the EOL. However, there are still many areas to be improved, and it is fundamentally necessary to spread the concept of 'ACP' within society.",0
Stakeholders' preferences for the design and delivery of virtual care services: A systematic review of discrete choice experiments.,"This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence from discrete choice experiments (DCEs) eliciting preferences for virtual models of care, as well as to assess the quality of those DCEs and compare the relative preferences for different stakeholder groups. Articles were included if published between January 2010 and December 2022. Data were synthesised narratively, and attributes were assessed for frequency, significance, and relative importance using a semi-quantitative approach. Overall, 21 studies were included encompassing a wide range of virtual care modalities, with the most common setting being virtual consultations for outpatient management of chronic conditions. A total of 135 attributes were identified and thematically classified into six categories: service delivery, service quality, technical aspects, monetary aspects, health provider characteristics and health consumer characteristics. Attributes related to service delivery were most frequently reported but less highly ranked. Service costs were consistently significant across all studies where they appeared, indicating their importance to the respondents. All studies examining health providers' preferences reported either system performance or professional endorsement attributes to be the most important. Substantial heterogeneity in attribute selection and preference outcomes were observed across studies reporting on health consumers' preferences, suggesting that the consideration of local context is important in the design and delivery of person-centred virtual care services. In general, the experimental design and analysis methods of included studies were clearly reported and justified. An improvement was observed in the quality of DCE design and analysis in recent years, particularly in the attribute development process. Given the continued growth in the use of DCEs within healthcare settings, further research is needed to develop a standardised approach for quantitatively synthesising DCE findings. There is also a need for further research on preferences for virtual care in post-pandemic contexts, where emerging evidence suggests that preferences may differ to those observed in pre-pandemic times.",1
Interdisciplinary care of pediatric oncology patients: A survey of clinicians in Central America and the Caribbean.,"BACKGROUND: Quality cancer care depends on interdisciplinary communication. This study explored the communication practices of interdisciplinary clinicians, the types of healthcare services for which they engage in interdisciplinary collaboration, and the association between interdisciplinary care and perceived quality of care, as well as job satisfaction. METHODS: We conducted a survey of interdisciplinary clinicians from cancer centers in Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, El Salvador, and Haiti. The survey included 68 items including previously validated tools and novel questions. RESULTS: Total 174 interdisciplinary clinicians completed the survey: nurses (n = 60), medical subspecialists (n = 35), oncologists (n = 22), psychosocial providers (n = 20), surgeons (n = 12), pathologists (n = 9), radiologists (n = 9), and radiation oncologists (n = 5). Oncologists reported daily communication with nurses (95%) and other oncologists (91%). While 90% of nurses reported daily communication with other nurses, only 66% reported daily communication with oncologists, and more than 50% of nurses reported never talking to pathologists, radiologists, radiation oncologists, or surgeons. Most clinicians described interdisciplinary establishment of cancer treatment goals and prognosis (84%), patient preferences (81%), and determination of first treatment modality (80%). Clinicians who described more interdisciplinary collaboration had higher job satisfaction (p = .04) and perceived a higher level of overall quality of care (p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians in these limited resource settings describe strong interdisciplinary collaboration contributing to higher job satisfaction and perceived quality of care. However, nurses in these settings reported more limited interdisciplinary communication and care. Additional studies are necessary to further define clinical roles on interdisciplinary care teams and their associations with patient outcomes.",0
A meta-analysis on the role older adults with cancer favour in treatment decision making.,"INTRODUCTION: In the complex setting of oncological treatment decision making, balancing professional guidance while respecting patient involvement can be a challenge. We set out to assess the role adults with cancer favour in treatment decision making (TDM), including differences across age groups and change over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE and Embase, for studies on role preference of (older) adults with cancer in oncological treatment decision making. A meta-analysis was conducted based on Control Preference Scale (CPS) data, a questionnaire on patient role preference in TDM. RESULTS: This meta-analysis includes 33 studies reporting CPS data comprising 17,197 adults with cancer. Mean age was 60.6 years old for studies that specified age (24 studies, 6155 patients). During the last decade, patients' role preference shifted towards significantly more active involvement in TDM (p = 0.006). No age-dependent subgroup differences have been identified; both younger and older adults, defined as, respectively, below and above 65 years old, favour active involvement in treatment decision making. DISCUSSION: Over time, adults with cancer have shifted towards more active role preference in treatment decision making. In current cancer care, a large majority prefers taking an active role, irrespective of age.",0
Timing of the Initial Postoperative Care After Cataract Surgery: A Patient's Perspective.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate patient preferences in regards to the timing of the initial postoperative examination after undergoing cataract surgery. METHODS: A retrospective, consecutive case series analysis from a single private practice institution was performed using a standardized phone survey on patients who underwent cataract surgery. Subjects were classified into one of two possible study groups according to the timing of their initial postoperative cataract surgery examination: Group A received the initial postoperative cataract surgery examination on the same day as the surgery, whereas Group B received the initial postoperative cataract surgery examination on the day following the operation. RESULTS: There were 80 subjects contacted for the phone survey of which 70 (35 in each study group) completed the survey and therefore were included in the analysis. Group A subjects responded favorably in regards to preference and realizing reduced time and cost savings compared to Group B (p < 0.0001 for both). There were no subjects in Group A who would have preferred next-day initial postoperative care, whereas 31.4% of subjects in Group B would have preferred same-day care if given the opportunity. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing cataract surgery both prefer and report time and cost savings with same-day initial postoperative care compared to next-day initial postoperative care. Patient preferences regarding their postoperative care should be one of the many factors that a surgeon ought to take into consideration when providing follow-up care after cataract surgery.",0
The cost of saying no: general practitioners' gatekeeping role in sickness absence certification.,"BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) have an important gatekeeping role in the Norwegian sickness insurance system. This role includes limiting access to paid sick leave when this is not justified according to sick leave criteria. 85% of GPs in Norway operate within a fee-for-service system that incentivises short consultations and high service provision. In this qualitative study, we explore how GPs practise the gatekeeping role in sickness absence certification. METHODS: Qualitative data was collected through six focus group interviews with 33 GPs, working in practices with a minimum of four practising GPs, in different geographical regions across Norway, including both urban and rural areas. Data was analysed using Braune and Clarke's thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Our results indicate that GPs' sick-listing decisions are largely driven by patient demand and preferences for sick leave. GPs reported that they rarely overrule patient requests for sickness absence, including in cases where such requests conflict with the GPs' opinion of whether sick leave is justified or benefits the patient. The degree of effort made to limit unjustified or non-beneficial sick leave seems to depend on the GPs' available time and perceived risk of conflict with the patient. GPs generally expressed dissatisfaction with their role as certifiers of sickness absence. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that GPs' decisions about sickness certification is largely driven by patient preferences. The GPs' gatekeeping function is limited to negotiations about grade and duration of absence spells.",0
Qualitative study of guideline panelists: innovative surveys provided valuable insights regarding patient values and preferences.,"OBJECTIVES: To explore guideline panelists' understanding of panel surveys for eliciting panels' inferences regarding patient values and preferences, and the influence of the surveys on making recommendations. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We performed sampling and data collection from all four guideline panels that had conducted the surveys through October 2020. We collected the records of all panel meetings and interviewed some panelists in different roles. We applied inductive thematic analysis for analyzing and interpreting data. RESULTS: We enrolled four guideline panels with 99 panelists in total and interviewed 25 of them. Most panelists found the survey was easy to follow and facilitated the incorporation of patient values and preferences in the tradeoffs between benefits and harms or burdens. The variation of patient preferences and uncertainty regarding patient values and preferences reflected in the surveys helped the panels ponder the strength of recommendations. In doing so, the survey results enhanced a rationale for panels' decision on the recommendations. CONCLUSION: The panel surveys have proved to help guideline panels explicitly consider and incorporate patient values and preferences in making recommendations. Guideline panels would benefit from widespread use of the panel surveys, particularly when primary evidence regarding patient values and preferences is scarce.",0
Development of a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure to assess patient perceptions of simplicity and complexity of treatment for type 2 diabetes.,"INTRODUCTION: Treatments for type 2 diabetes vary widely in their complexity. The simplicity or complexity of a treatment regimen may have an impact on patient preference, treatment adherence, and health outcomes. The purpose of this qualitative study was to develop two draft patient-reported outcome instruments focusing on patients' experience with simplicity and complexity of treatment for type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The instruments were developed in a series of steps: gather information to support development of a concept elicitation interview guide (literature review and expert interviews), concept elicitation interviews with patients (N = 30), cognitive interviews with patients (N = 20), and a translatability assessment. RESULTS: In concept elicitation interviews, patients with type 2 diabetes reported a range of treatment attributes that influence their perceptions of treatment simplicity and complexity, such as injection devices, medication preparation, dose timing, dose frequency, ease of taking the correct dose, flexibility of dose schedule, remembering to take medication, and food requirements. Two draft questionnaires were developed based on the literature review, expert interviews, and concept elicitation interviews with patients. Revisions were made to these draft instruments based on qualitative interviews with patients and translatability assessment. DISCUSSION: The qualitative research conducted in this study supports the content validity of two newly developed instruments, the Simplicity of Diabetes Treatment Questionnaire (Sim-Q) and the Simplicity of Diabetes Treatment Questionnaire-Comparison (Sim-Q-Comp), designed to assess the simplicity and complexity of diabetes treatment from the patient's perspective.",0
Research trends in contemporary health economics: a scientometric analysis on collective content of specialty journals.,"INTRODUCTION: Health economics is a thriving sub-discipline of economics. Applied health economics research is considered essential in the health care sector and is used extensively by public policy makers. For scholars, it is important to understand the history and status of health economics-when it emerged, the rate of research output, trending topics, and its temporal evolution-to ensure clarity and direction when formulating research questions. METHODS: Nearly 13,000 articles were analysed, which were found in the collective publications of the ten most specialised health economic journals. We explored this literature using patterns of term co-occurrence and document co-citation. RESULTS: The research output in this field is growing exponentially. Five main research divisions were identified: (i) macroeconomic evaluation, (ii) microeconomic evaluation, (iii) measurement and valuation of outcomes, (iv) monitoring mechanisms (evaluation), and (v) guidance and appraisal. Document co-citation analysis revealed eighteen major research streams and identified variation in the magnitude of activities in each of the streams. A recent emergence of research activities in health economics was seen in the Medicaid Expansion stream. Established research streams that continue to show high levels of activity include Child Health, Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and Cost-effectiveness. Conversely, Patient Preference, Health Care Expenditure and Economic Evaluation are now past their peak of activity in specialised health economic journals. Analysis also identified several streams that emerged in the past but are no longer active. CONCLUSIONS: Health economics is a growing field, yet there is minimal evidence of creation of new research trends. Over the past 10 years, the average rate of annual increase in internationally collaborated publications is almost double that of domestic collaborations (8.4% vs 4.9%), but most of the top scholarly collaborations remain between six countries only.",0
A Discrete Choice Experiment to Assess Patient Preferences for Asthma Rescue Therapy and Disease Management.,"BACKGROUND: With the expanding treatment landscape for asthma, the process of identifying best-fit, individualized management options is becoming increasingly complicated. Understanding patients' preferences can inform shared decision-making between clinicians and patients. OBJECTIVES: To examine preferences of adults with asthma for therapeutic and management attributes and determine how these preferences vary among patients. METHODS: We conducted an online discrete choice experiment survey in US adults with asthma. Patient preferences were analyzed using logit models. Factors affecting patients' preferences were identified by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,184 patients completed the survey (60% female; mean [SD] age, 49.2 [15.0] years). Patients most valued fewer asthma attacks requiring urgent health care professional visits, fewer exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids, and a reduced risk for oral thrush. Higher value was placed on reducing the risk of short-term (oral thrush) versus long-term side effects (diabetes). Patients were willing to increase rescue medication use in exchange for decreasing exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and attacks requiring urgent health care professional visits. Patients preferred a single inhaler for rescue and maintenance and least valued asthma action plans. Demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors affected patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: Patients sought convenient management options that focused mainly on decreasing the short-term morbidity associated with asthma exacerbations and therapies. Preferences varied by demographics, clinical factors, and socioeconomics. It is important for shared decision-making discussions to include conversations about morbidity and how available therapeutic options align with individual patient preferences.",1
Changing patient preferences toward better trial recruitment: an ethical analysis.,"While randomized controlled trials are essential to health research, many of these trials fail to recruit enough participants. Approaching recruitment through the lens of behavioral science can help trialists to understand influences on the decision to participate and use them to increase recruitment. Although this approach is promising, the use of behavioral influences during recruitment is in tension with the ethical principle of respect for persons, as at least some of these influences could be used to manipulate potential participants. In this paper, we examine this tension by discussing two types of behavioral influences: one example involves physician recommendations, and the other involves framing of information to exploit cognitive biases. We argue that despite the apparent tension with ethical principles, influencing trial participants through behavior change strategies can be ethically acceptable. However, we argue that trialists have a positive obligation to analyze their recruitment strategies for behavioral influences and disclose these upfront to the research ethics committee. But we also acknowledge that since neither trialists nor ethics committees are presently well equipped to perform these analyses, additional resources and guidance are needed. We close by outlining a path toward the development of such guidance.",0
"Effectiveness and Tolerability of Ectoin(®) Mouth and Throat Spray Althaea Honey (ERS09) for Sore Throat due to Acute Pharyngitis and Dry Cough: A Multicentre, Actively Controlled, Open Label Study in Germany.","Acute pharyngitis can cause sore throat. This multicentre, active-controlled, randomised, open-label, and parallel-group study, conducted according to the German Medical Devices Act, compared the effectiveness and tolerability of ERS09 mouth and throat spray with a well-established device for the treatment of sore throat caused by acute pharyngitis and dry cough. Patients were randomised 1:1 into ERS09/comparator groups (EMSER(®) Sore Throat Spray) for 7 ± 2 days. Patients and investigators reported effectiveness (change in total symptom score [TSS]) and safety endpoints (incidence of adverse events [AEs]; adverse device effects [ADEs]). A total of 186 patients were included (ERS09: n = 92; comparator: n = 94). The baseline-adjusted mean TSS over 7 days was -90.14 and -74.91 in the ERS09 and comparator groups, respectively (p < 0.05). The majority of patients reached a 50% reduction in symptoms by day 6 (ERS09 = 78.85; comparator = 75.8%). Most patients reported a soothing effect within five minutes (ERS09 = 82%; comparator = 71%). Improvements in individual symptoms were similar with no significant differences between groups; more patients in the ERS09 group reported an improvement in pharyngeal redness/swelling. Three AEs unrelated to medication, one ADE following ERS09, and no serious AE/ADE were reported. ERS09 was as well tolerated and effective as the established device, showing greater improvement in the management of some symptoms and greater patient preference.",0
Patients' preferences for secondary prevention following a coronary event.,"OBJECTIVE: Despite clear evidence on the effectiveness of secondary prevention, patients with coronary artery disease frequently fail to reach guideline-based risk factor targets. Integrating patients' preferences into treatment decisions has been recommended to reduce this gap. However, this requires knowledge about patient treatment preferences. Therefore, through a survey study, we aimed to explore which risk factors patients self-perceived, prioritised for improvement, and needed support with after a recent hospitalisation for coronary heart disease. METHODS: A digital questionnaire was presented to patients > 18 years recently discharged (≤3 months) from an acute coronary care unit in the Netherlands (Europe). Patients could select from eight cardiovascular risk factors that they (1) self-perceived, (2) prioritised for improvement, and (3) needed support to improve. Patients' perceived risk factors were compared to those documented in the medical records. RESULTS: Respondents (N = 254, 26 % women), mean age 64 (SD 10) years, identified 'physical inactivity' more frequently than their medical records (140 patients vs. 91 records, p < 0.001), while three other risk factors were reported with equal and four with lower frequency. 'Physical inactivity', 'overweight' and 'stress' were most frequently prioritised for improvement (82 %, 88 % and 78 %) and professional support (64 %, 50 % and 58 %), with 87 % preferring lifestyle optimisation if this would reduce drug use. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a recent coronary event show significant disparities in identifying risk factors compared to their medical records. They tend to prefer improving lifestyle- over drug-modifiable risk factors, particularly physical inactivity, overweight and stress, and indicate the need for support in improving these factors.",0
Nursing Home Resident Preferences for Daily Care and Activities: A Latent Class Analysis of National Data.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Uncovering subgroups of nursing home residents sharing similar preference patterns is useful for developing systematic approaches to person-centered care. This study aimed to (i) identify preference patterns among long-stay residents, and (ii) examine the associations of preference patterns with resident and facility characteristics. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a national cross-sectional analysis of Minimum Data Set assessments in 2016. Using resident-rated importance for 16 preference items in the Preference Assessment Tool as indicators, we conducted latent class analysis to identify preference patterns and examined their associations with resident and facility characteristics. RESULTS: We identified 4 preference patterns. The high salience group (43.5% of the sample) was the most likely to rate all preferences as important, whereas the low salience group (8.7%) was the least likely. The socially engaged (27.2%) and the socially independent groups (20.6%) featured high importance ratings on social/recreational activities and maintaining privacy/autonomy, respectively. The high salience group reported more favorable physical and sensory function than the other 3 groups and lived in facilities with higher staffing of activity staff. The low salience and socially independent groups reported a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms, whereas the low salience or socially engaged groups reported a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment. Preference patterns also varied by race/ethnicity and gender. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our study advanced the understanding of within-individual variations in preferences, and the role of individual and environmental factors in shaping preferences. The findings provided implications for providing person-centered care in NHs.",0
Flexor Injury Rehabilitation Splint Trial (FIRST): protocol for a pragmatic randomised controlled trial comparing three splints for finger flexor tendon repairs.,"BACKGROUND: Without surgical repair, flexor tendon injuries do not heal and patients' ability to bend fingers and grip objects is impaired. However, flexor tendon repair surgery also requires optimal rehabilitation. There are currently three custom-made splints used in the rehabilitation of zone I/II flexor tendon repairs, each with different assumed harm/benefit profiles: the dorsal forearm and hand-based splint (long), the Manchester short splint (short), and the relative motion flexion splint (mini). There is, however, no robust evidence as to which splint, if any, is most clinical or cost effective. The Flexor Injury Rehabilitation Splint Trial (FIRST) was designed to address this evidence gap. METHODS: FIRST is a parallel group, superiority, analyst-blind, multi-centre, individual participant-randomised controlled trial. Participants will be assigned 1:1:1 to receive either the long, short, or mini splint. We aim to recruit 429 participants undergoing rehabilitation following zone I/II flexor tendon repair surgery. Potential participants will initially be identified prior to surgery, in NHS hand clinics across the UK, and consented and randomised at their splint fitting appointment post-surgery. The primary outcome will be the mean post-randomisation score on the patient-reported wrist and hand evaluation measure (PRWHE), assessed at 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks post randomisation. Secondary outcome measures include blinded grip strength and active range of movement (AROM) assessments, adverse events, adherence to the splinting protocol (measured via temperature sensors inserted into the splints), quality of life assessment, and further patient-reported outcomes. An economic evaluation will assess the cost-effectiveness of each splint, and a qualitative sub-study will evaluate participants' preferences for, and experiences of wearing, the splints. Furthermore, a mediation analysis will determine the relationship between patient preferences, splint adherence, and splint effectiveness. DISCUSSION: FIRST will compare the three splints with respect to clinical efficacy, complications, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. FIRST is a pragmatic trial which will recruit from 26 NHS sites to allow findings to be generalisable to current clinical practice in the UK. It will also provide significant insights into patient experiences of splint wear and how adherence to splinting may impact outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN: 10236011.",0
Adequate menstrual suppression in adolescents with inherited bleeding disorders often requires multiple treatment changes: Retrospective cohort study of a multidisciplinary clinic.,"Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is often the presenting symptom for females with inherited bleeding disorders (IBD). Multidisciplinary clinics leverage the expertise of hematologists and women's health specialists. This study characterizes the complexity of HMB management for adolescents with IBDs from a large multidisciplinary clinic. Adolescents often required multiple different menstrual suppression treatments, with only about 20% achieving acceptable suppression with their first treatment. Adolescents switched therapy most often for uncontrolled bleeding, followed by adverse effects, and patient preference. Given the difficulty in achieving adequate menstrual suppression, multidisciplinary clinics offer necessary expertise in accomplishing bleeding control with minimal adverse effects.",0
Uptake of BRCA1/BRCA2 predictive genetic testing in an Irish population is low: a missed opportunity.,"INTRODUCTION: Predictive testing for BRCA1 or BRCA2 allows at-risk individuals to engage with appropriate screening and treatment services if a pathogenic mutation is identified. Previous studies have shown uptake of predictive testing to most commonly range between 20% and 40% (Table 2). This represents a missed cancer prevention opportunity. Possible explanations for this low uptake include lack of disclosure of at-risk status to relatives, lack of awareness of cancer genetics services, or patient preference. The goal of the current study was to investigate the uptake of BRCA1 or BRCA2 predictive testing in an Irish population. METHODS: We performed a multicentre, retrospective analysis of 63 pedigrees from two Irish tertiary referral hospitals over a five-year period (2012-2017). Family pedigrees were reviewed to identify at-risk family members eligible for predictive BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation testing as per international guidelines, and testing rates were determined. RESULTS: A total of 1048 eligible individuals were identified, 318 (30.4%) proceeded to BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline testing including [215 (37.5%) females and 99 males (21.5%)]. Women were significantly more likely to test than men (T = 3.7, p < .0002). Uptake of testing was significant higher amongst first-degree relatives 45% (150/323) compared to 20% (50/258) amongst second degree relatives, and 10 % (33/317) amongst more distant relatives (F = 25.32, p < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Uptake of BRCA1 OR BRCA2 mutation testing in Ireland is suboptimal, particularly amongst Irish males and distant relatives. Further research is needed to identify strategies which may improve uptake within current legal and ethical frameworks.",0
Gastric Electrical Stimulation for Refractory Gastroparesis: A Promising Treatment Modality for Symptom Control and Gastric Emptying.,"Gastroparesis is a disorder with few available treatments and delayed stomach emptying. Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) has shown promise in treating the signs and symptoms of gastroparesis as well as gastric emptying by stimulating the stomach with high-frequency electrical impulses. In this case, a 43-year-old lady with refractory gastroparesis had a GES device laparoscopically implanted. Even though GES seems promising, more study is necessary to improve patient choice, technique, and long-term results. Patients with refractory gastroparesis who have not responded to traditional therapy should be considered for GES, with treatment decisions being made individually depending on clinical presentation and patient preferences.",0
Similar outcomes of arteriovenous fistulae created under general or regional anesthesia.,"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that type of anesthesia can significantly change vascular access surgery outcomes. Still, there is limited evidence on the impact of regional anesthesia (RA) on patency and failure rates compared to general anesthesia (GA). The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of RA and GA in patients who underwent vascular access creation at our center. METHODS: Data collected in our prospectively maintained database of patients with chronic renal dysfunction requiring hemodialysis were analyzed, 464 patients were included. Outcome parameters such as maturation, primary failure, postoperative flow measurements, patency rates, and survival outcomes were compared between RA and GA groups. RESULTS: In this study 489 vascular access procedures were performed in 464 patients, 318 included in the RA group and 171 in the GA group. Median follow-up time was 29.9 (IQR 37.3) months in the RA group versus 33.0 (IQR 40.7) in the GA group (p = 0.252). Anesthesia type did not significantly affect patient survival (HR, 1.01; CI, 0.70-1.45; p = 0.976). No significant differences were found in vascular access flow volume, primary failure, or time to cannulation between the RA and GA groups for both radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae and brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae. Anesthesia type did not significantly change patency outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, both RA and GA demonstrate similar results regarding patient survival, maturation, failure, or patency after vascular access creation. Still, patient-specific factors for each type of anesthesia as well as patient preference should be considered.",0
Accentuating patient values in shared decision-making: A mixed methods development of an online value clarification tool and communication training in the context of early phase clinical cancer trials.,"OBJECTIVE: In the shared decision-making (SDM) process for potential early phase clinical cancer trial participation, value clarification is highly recommended. However, exploration and discussion of patient values between patients and oncologists remains limited. This study aims to develop an SDM-supportive intervention, consisting of a preparatory online value clarification tool (OnVaCT) and a communication training. METHODS: The OnVaCT intervention was developed and pilot-tested by combining theoretical notions on value clarification, with interview studies with patients and oncologists, focus groups with patient representatives and oncologists, and think aloud sessions with patients, following the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for complex interventions. These human-centered methodologies enabled a user-centered approach at every step of the development process of the intervention. RESULTS: This study shows relevant patient values and oncologists' perspectives on value exploration and discussion in daily practice. This has been combined with theoretical considerations into the creation of characters based on real-life experiences of patients in the OnVaCT, and how the tool is combined with a communication training for oncologists to improve SDM.",0
Patient preferences for heart valve disease intervention.,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine how patients trade-off the benefits and risks of two different types of procedures used to treat heart valve disease (HVD). It also aimed to determine patients' preferences for HVD treatments (predicted uptake) and the relative importance of each treatment attribute. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in Australia and Japan with patients who required a heart valve procedure. Patients were stratified into three categories: no prior procedure experience, minimally invasive procedure experience and invasive procedure experience. DCE attributes included risk of mortality; risk of stroke; needing dialysis; needing a new pacemaker; valve durability; independence 1 month after surgery; and out-of-pocket expenses. Participants chose between two hypothetical labelled approaches to therapy ('invasive procedure' and 'minimally invasive procedure'), with a separate opt-out included. A mixed multinomial logit model was used to analyse preferences. RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 143 Australian and 206 Japanese patients. Both populations demonstrated an overall preference for the minimally invasive procedure over the invasive procedure. All attributes tested significantly predicted choice and were important to patient decision-making. However, patients' choices were most influenced by the durability of the valve and the likelihood of independence postprocedure, irrespective of their prior procedure experience. Differences in preference were observed between Australian and Japanese patients; valve durability was the most important attribute among Australian patients, while Japanese patients emphasised regaining independence postsurgery. Risk of mortality was less important relative to other key attributes in Japan; however, it remained significant to the model. CONCLUSIONS: HVD patients prefer a minimally invasive procedure over an invasive procedure, irrespective of prior treatment experience. Key attributes contributing to treatment preferences are valve durability and faster recovery. These results can be used to help inform healthcare decision-makers about what features of heart valve procedures patients value most. PATIENT AND PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: People with lived experience of HVD were included in multiple stages of the design phase of this research. First, patients and doctors were consulted by taking part in qualitative interviews. The qualitative interviews helped inform which treatment attributes to include in the DCE based on what was important to those with lived experience and those who help make treatment decisions on behalf of patients. Qualitative interview participants also assisted with the framing of questions in the online survey to ensure the terminology was patient-friendly and relevant to those with lived experience. Following qualitative interviews, the DCE attribute list was agreed on in expert consultation with a steering committee, which included patient representatives and treating physicians (interventional cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons). The survey was also pilot tested with a small sample of patients and minor adjustments were made to the wording to ensure it was appropriate and meaningful to those with lived experience of HVD.",1
Breast filler granuloma mistaken for implant rupture: A case report.,"RATIONALE: Breast augmentation is usually performed by inserting implants into the breasts. However, injectable fillers are sometimes used for the convenience of both patients and surgeons. If foreign substances, such as biomaterials, are injected into the body, complications such as inflammation, granuloma, and tissue necrosis can occur owing to foreign body reactions. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 39-year-old female patient visited our hospital complaining of tenderness, redness, and swelling in both breasts. The patient had undergone bilateral breast augmentation using implants 4 years prior to current consult. DIAGNOSES: On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cystic lesions and fluid collections were observed, with findings suggesting implant rupture; hence, surgery was planned to remove both implants. INTERVENTIONS: Intraoperatively, the implant was malpositioned in the upper lateral portion without rupture. Capsular contracture findings were also not prominent. A large amount of inflammatory granuloma was observed and removed in the prepectoral plane, and the implants were immediately inserted into a new subpectoral plane. OUTCOMES: The volume of the new implant was 175 mL, which was smaller than the previous one, as per the patient preference. Cytology of the fluid from the previous implant pocket showed no evidence of malignancy, and the granuloma was identified as inflammatory tissue caused by a foreign body reaction on biopsy. The excessive protrusion of both breasts was corrected after surgery, and the patient was satisfied with the aesthetic outcomes without any complications up to 3 months after surgery. LESSONS: The use of injectable fillers for breast augmentation carries the risk of misdiagnosis, and, therefore, surgeons should always exercise caution.",0
Valued Outcomes in the Cancer Experience (VOICE)™: Development and validation of a multidimensional measure of perceived control.,"OBJECTIVE: Enhancing cancer patients' sense of control can positively impact psychological well-being. We developed and assessed the psychometric properties of Valued Outcomes in the Cancer Experience (VOICE)(TM), a measure of patients' perceived control over key personal priorities within their cancer experience. METHODS: VOICE construction and testing were completed in three phases with separate participant samples: (1) item generation and initial item pool testing (N = 459), (2) scale refinement (N = 623), and (3) confirmatory validation (N = 515). RESULTS: A 21-item measure was developed that captures cancer patients' sense of control in seven key domains: (1) Purpose and Meaning, (2) Functional Capacity, (3) Longevity, (4) Quality Care, (5) Illness Knowledge, (6) Social Support, and (7) Financial Capability. VOICE demonstrated adequate internal consistency (full-scale α = 0.93; factor α = 0.67-0.89) and adequate to strong convergent and discriminatory validity. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: VOICE measures cancer patients' perceived control across a diverse range of personal priorities, creating a platform for elevating patient perspectives and identifying pathways to enhance patient well-being. VOICE is positioned to guide understanding of the patient experience and aid the development and evaluation of supportive care interventions to enhance well-being.",0
Estimation of Intangible Costs for Factors Associated with Oral Antiviral Drugs for COVID-19 Treatment: A Conjoint Analysis in Japan.,"INTRODUCTION: During the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, preferences for factors associated with vaccines have been evaluated. Three oral antiviral drugs have been approved in Japan for patients with mild-to-moderate I COVID-19 symptoms. Although preferences for the drugs may also depend on various factors, these have not been fully evaluated. METHODS: A conjoint analysis was performed based on an online survey in August 2022 to estimate the intangible costs of factors associated with oral antiviral drugs for COVID-19. Respondents were individuals aged 20-69 across Japan. The attributes included the company (Japanese/foreign) that developed the drug, formulation and size of the drug, frequency of administration per day, number of tablets/capsules per dose, number of days until no longer infectious to others, and out-of-pocket expenses. A logistic regression model was applied to estimate the utility of each level for each attribute. The intangible costs were calculated by comparing the utility to the out-of-pocket attribute. RESULTS: Responses were collected from 11,303 participants. The difference between levels was the largest for companies that developed a drug; the intangible costs were JPY 5390 higher for the foreign company than for the Japanese company. The next largest difference was in the number of days until one is no longer infectious. For the same formulation, the intangible cost was lower for small sizes than large sizes. For similar-sized tablets and capsules, the intangible cost was lower for tablets than capsules. These tendencies were similar regardless of COVID-19 infection history and the presence of risk factors for severe COVID-19 in the respondents. CONCLUSION: Intangible costs for factors associated with oral antiviral drugs among the Japanese population were estimated. The results may change as the number of people with a history of COVID-19 infection increases and significant progress is made regarding treatments.",1
Guidelines on the prevention of foot ulcers in persons with diabetes (IWGDF 2023 update).,"AIMS: This is the 2023 International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot guideline on the prevention of foot ulcers in persons with diabetes, which updates the 2019 guideline. This guideline is targeted at clinicians and other healthcare professionals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology to devise clinical questions and critically important outcomes in the PICO format, to conduct a systematic review of the medical-scientific literature including, where appropriate, meta-analyses, and to write recommendations and their rationale. The recommendations are based on the quality of evidence found in the systematic review, expert opinion where (sufficient) evidence was not available, and a weighing of the desirable and undesirable effects of an intervention, as well as patient preferences, costs, equity, feasibility and applicability. RESULTS: We recommend screening a person with diabetes at very low risk of foot ulceration annually for the loss of protective sensation and peripheral artery disease, and screening persons at higher risk at higher frequencies for additional risk factors. For preventing a foot ulcer, educate persons at-risk about appropriate foot self-care, educate not to walk without suitable foot protection, and treat any pre-ulcerative lesion on the foot. Educate moderate-to-high risk people with diabetes to wear properly fitting, accommodative, therapeutic footwear, and consider coaching them to monitor foot skin temperature. Prescribe therapeutic footwear that has a demonstrated plantar pressure relieving effect during walking, to help prevent plantar foot ulcer recurrence. Consider advising people at low-to-moderate risk to undertake a, preferably supervised, foot-ankle exercise programme to reduce ulcer risk factors, and consider communicating that a total increase in weight-bearing activity of 1000 steps/day is likely safe with regards to risk of ulceration. In people with non-rigid hammertoe with pre-ulcerative lesion, consider flexor tendon tenotomy. We suggest not to use a nerve decompression procedure to help prevent foot ulcers. Provide integrated foot care for moderate-to-high-risk people with diabetes to help prevent (recurrence of) ulceration. CONCLUSIONS: These recommendations should help healthcare professionals to provide better care for persons with diabetes at risk of foot ulceration, to increase the number of ulcer-free days and reduce the patient and healthcare burden of diabetes-related foot disease.",0
A Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Patients With Acute Spinal Cord Injury: Recommendations on Hemodynamic Management.,"STUDY DESIGN: Clinical practice guideline development following the GRADE process. OBJECTIVES: Hemodynamic management is one of the only available treatment options that likely improves neurologic outcomes in patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Augmenting mean arterial pressure (MAP) aims to improve blood perfusion and oxygen delivery to the injured spinal cord in order to minimize secondary ischemic damage to neural tissue. The objective of this guideline was to update the 2013 AANS/CNS recommendations on the hemodynamic management of patients with acute traumatic SCI, acknowledging that much has been published in this area since its publication. Specifically, we sought to make recommendations on 1. The range of mean arterial pressure (MAP) to be maintained by identifying an upper and lower MAP limit; 2. The duration of such MAP augmentation; and 3. The choice of vasopressor. Additionally, we sought to make a recommendation on spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP) targets. METHODS: A multidisciplinary guideline development group (GDG) was formed that included health care professionals from a wide range of clinical specialities, patient advocates, and individuals living with SCI. The GDG reviewed the 2013 AANS/CNS guidelines and voted on whether each recommendation should be endorsed or updated. A systematic review of the literature, following PRISMA standards and registered in PROSPERO, was conducted to inform the guideline development process and address the following key questions: (i) what are the effects of goal-directed interventions to optimize spinal cord perfusion on extent of neurological recovery and rates of adverse events at any time point of follow-up? and (ii) what are the effects of particular monitoring techniques, perfusion ranges, pharmacological agents, and durations of treatment on extent of neurological recovery and rates of adverse events at any time point of follow-up? The GDG combined the information from this systematic review with their clinical expertise in order to develop recommendations on a MAP target range (specifically an upper and lower limit to target), the optimal duration for MAP augmentation, and the use of vasopressors or inotropes. Using methods outlined by the GRADE working group, recommendations were formulated that considered the balance of benefits and harms, financial impact, acceptability, feasibility and patient preferences. RESULTS: The GDG suggested that MAP should be augmented to at least 75-80 mmHg as the ""lower limit,"" but not actively augmented beyond an ""upper limit"" of 90-95 mmHg in order to optimize spinal cord perfusion in acute traumatic SCI. The quality of the evidence around the ""target MAP"" was very low, and thus the strength of this recommendation is weak. For duration of hemodynamic management, the GDG ""suggested"" that MAP be augmented for a duration of 3-7 days. Again, the quality of the evidence around the duration of MAP support was very low, and thus the strength of this recommendation is also weak. The GDG felt that a recommendation on the choice of vasopressor or the use of SCPP targets was not warranted, given the dearth of available evidence. CONCLUSION: We provide new recommendations for blood pressure management after acute SCI that acknowledge the limitations of the current evidence on the relationship between MAP and neurologic recovery. It was felt that the low quality of existing evidence and uncertainty around the relationship between MAP and neurologic recovery justified a greater range of MAP to target, and for a broader range of days post-injury than recommended in previous guidelines. While important knowledge gaps still remain regarding hemodynamic management, these recommendations represent current perspectives on the role of MAP augmentation for acute SCI.",0
Patient evaluation of gynaecological information provision and preferences.,"AIM: To evaluate gynaecological patients' preferences and satisfaction regarding information provision, exploring enablers and barriers to information access. DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional survey design was used. METHODS: A total of 293 women accessing gynaecological services responded to the survey. Quantitative analysis included descriptive and inferential statistics. Content analysis was conducted on qualitative data. RESULTS: Health professionals were the most common and preferred sources of gynaecological health information. Enablers to information provision included positive communication strategies by health professionals, participants having prior knowledge and doing their own research. Despite its widespread availability, only 24.2% of women preferred the internet as an information source. Poor communication and inadequate information provision were identified as barriers to information access. Statistically significant associations were identified between location of residence, education level, year of birth, diagnostic group and health information preferences. Recommendations from women included improved communication strategies, system changes and provision of individualized information. CONCLUSION: Health professionals are central to women accessing information about gynaecological diagnoses. Areas for improvement include communication strategies, facilitating access to internet-based resources for information and consideration of women's preferences when providing health information. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND PATIENT CARE: Consumer co-design of gynaecological health information and communication training for health professionals is recommended. Improved communication and facilitated use of internet-based resources may improve women's understanding of information. IMPACT: This study explored gynaecological patients' preferences and satisfaction regarding information provision, exploring enablers and barriers to information access. It was found that gynaecological patients preferred individualized information provided to them directly by health professionals and despite its widespread availability, the internet is an underutilized health information resource. These findings are applicable to health professionals and patients utilizing tertiary gynaecological health services in Australia but may be generalized if demographic data aligns with other jurisdictions. REPORTING METHOD: The STROBE reporting method was used in the preparation of the manuscript. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No patient or public contribution.",0

Qualitative assessment of healthy volunteer experience receiving subcutaneous infusions of high-dose benzathine penicillin G (SCIP) provides insights into design of late phase clinical studies.,"INTRODUCTION: Secondary prophylaxis to prevent rheumatic heart disease (RHD) progression, in the form of four-weekly intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin G (BPG) injections, has remained unchanged since 1955. Qualitative investigations into patient preference have highlighted the need for long-acting penicillins to be delivered less frequently, ideally with reduced pain. We describe the experience of healthy volunteers participating in a phase-I safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic trial of subcutaneous infusions of high-dose benzathine penicillin G (BPG)-the SCIP study (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12622000916741). METHODS: Participants (n = 24) received between 6.9 mL to 20.7 mL (3-9 times the standard dose) of BPG as a single infusion into the abdominal subcutaneous tissues via a spring-driven syringe pump over approximately 20 minutes. Semi-structured interviews at four time points were recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. Tolerability and specific descriptors of the experience were explored, alongside thoughts on how the intervention could be improved for future trials in children and young adults receiving monthly BPG intramuscular injections for RHD. RESULTS: Participants tolerated the infusion well and were able describe their experiences throughout. Most reported minimal pain, substantiated via quantitative pain scores. Abdominal bruising at the infusion site did not concern participants nor impair normal activities. Insight into how SCIP could be improved for children included the use of topical analgesia, distractions via television or personal devices, a drawn-out infusion time with reduced delivery speed, and alternative infusion sites. Trust in the trial team was high. CONCLUSION: Qualitative research is an important adjunct for early-phase clinical trials, particularly when adherence to the planned intervention is a key driver of success. These results will inform later-phase SCIP trials in people living with RHD and other indications.",0
Patient Preferences for Pharmaceutical and Device-Based Treatments for Uncontrolled Hypertension: Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiment is a survey method used to understand how individuals make decisions and to quantify the relative importance of features. Using discrete choice experiment methods, we quantified patient benefit-risk preferences for hypertension treatments, including pharmaceutical and interventional treatments, like renal denervation. METHODS: Respondents from the United States with physician-confirmed uncontrolled hypertension selected between treatments involving a procedure or pills, using a structured survey. Treatment features included interventional, noninterventional, or no hypertension treatment; number of daily blood pressure (BP) pills; expected reduction in office systolic BP; duration of effect; and risks of drug side effects, access site pain, or vascular injury. The results of a random-parameters logit model were used to estimate the importance of each treatment attribute. RESULTS: Among 400 patients completing the survey between 2020 and 2021, demographics included: 52% women, mean age 59.2±13.0 years, systolic BP 155.1±12.3 mm Hg, and 1.8±0.9 prescribed antihypertensive medications. Reduction in office systolic BP was the most important treatment attribute. The remaining attributes, in decreasing order, were duration of effect, whether treatment was interventional, number of daily pills, risk of vascular injury, and risk of drug side effects. Risk of access site pain did not influence choice. In general, respondents preferred noninterventional over interventional treatments, yet only a 2.3 mm Hg reduction in office systolic BP was required to offset this preference. Small reductions in office systolic BP would offset risks of vascular injury or drug side effects. At least a 20% risk of vascular injury or drug side effects would be tolerated in exchange for improved BP. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in systolic BP was identified as the most important driver of patient treatment preference, while treatment-related risks had less influence. The results indicate that respondents would accept interventional treatments in exchange for modest reductions in systolic BP compared with those observed in renal denervation trials.",1
Comparing quality of recovery and satisfaction between spinal anesthesia and nerve block in orthopedic below-knee surgery: A prospective controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative quality of recovery (QoR) and patient satisfaction have gained increasing significance in medical services. This study aimed to compare these 2 parameters between 2 types of regional anesthetics (spinal anesthesia and combined sciatic-femoral nerve block) in orthopedic lower knee surgery. METHODS: A total of 101 patients were classified into 2 groups (combined sciatic-femoral nerve block, group N; spinal anesthesia, group S) according to patient preference. In group N, sciatic and femoral nerve blocks were performed on the popliteal and groin regions, respectively, under ultrasound guidance. Spinal anesthesia was performed in group S. The primary outcomes were QoR and patient satisfaction. QoR was measured using the Korean translation of the QoR-15K. Patient satisfaction was assessed using an 11-point Likert scale (0-10) and a dichotomous question addressing anesthesia preferences for future surgeries. RESULTS: The physical independence of the postoperative QoR-15K was significantly higher in group N than in group S (14.2 vs 12.0, P = .04). On the 11-point Likert scale, group N scored 8.8, and group S scored 7.8 (P = .001). In the dichotomous question, 93.8% of the group N and 52.8% of the group S answered that they would like to choose the same anesthesia method for the next surgery (P < .001). In addition, fewer participants in group N complained of backache than those in group S, and the time to first urination after anesthesia was shorter in group N than in group S (P = .004, <.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Combined sciatic-femoral nerve block may provide better physical independence and satisfaction than spinal anesthesia in orthopedic below-knee surgeries.",0
What Features of Fertility Treatment do Patients Value? Price Elasticity and Willingness-to-Pay Values from a Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Infertility is a medical condition affecting an estimated 186 million people worldwide. Medically assisted fertility treatments allow many of these individuals to have a baby. Insights about preferences of patients who have experienced fertility treatment should be used to inform funding policies and treatment configurations that best reflect the patients' voice and the value of fertility treatment to patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore the preferences for fertility treatment attributes of infertile women who had previously undergone or were undergoing fertility treatments-ex post perspective. METHODS: We used data from a stated-preference discrete choice experiment (DCE) among 376 Australian women who had undergone or were undergoing fertility treatment. Respondents chose their preferred treatment choices in 12 hypothetical treatment choice scenarios described by seven attributes (success rates, side effects, counselling/peer support, treatment journey, continuity of care, availability of experimental treatment and out-of-pocket cost). We estimated random parameter logit (RPL) and latent class (LC) models that accounted for preference heterogeneity. The results were used to derive price elasticities of demand and marginal willingness-to-pay (WTP) values for the treatment attributes explored within the DCE survey. RESULTS: Income level did not have a significant effect on marginal WTP for fertility treatment attributes. The demand for fertility treatment from an ex post perspective was found to be highly inelastic (treatment cost changes had almost no impact on demand). Success rates and out-of-pocket costs were significant and important predictors of individuals' treatment choices conditional on the attributes and levels included in the study. These were followed by counselling/peer support, side effects, treatment journey, continuity of care, and availability of experimental treatment, in that order. Respondents were willing to pay $383-$524 per one percentage point increase in the treatment success rate and over $2000 and over $3500 to avoid moderate and significant side effects, respectively (values are reported in AU$). Latent class models revealed that the majority of respondents (51%) were risk-averse success-rate seekers. CONCLUSION: Infertile women who had previously undergone or were undergoing fertility treatment valued fertility treatment highly as reflected by highly price-inelastic demand. Success rate of treatment and out-of-pocket costs were the most important attributes and largely determined patients' WTP for fertility treatment relative to the attributes and levels used in the study. While further research should investigate the price sensitivity of women who have not experienced fertility treatment, these results might explain why women continue fertility treatment once they have commenced despite their financial capacity to pay. Future research should also determine patients' price elasticities for a fertility treatment program with multiple treatment cycles.",1
Use of expectant management based on prostate cancer risk and health status: How far are we from a risk-adapted approach?,"OBJECTIVES: While active surveillance, a form of expectant management (EM), is preferred for patients with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa), some favor a more risk-adapted approach that recognizes patient preferences and condition-specific factors. However, previous research has shown non-patient-related factors often drive PCa treatment. In this context, we characterized trends in AS with respect to disease risk and health status. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using SEER-Medicare data, we identified men 66 years and older diagnosed with localized low- and intermediate-risk PCa from 2008 to 2017 and examined receipt of EM, defined as the absence of treatment (i.e., surgery, cryotherapy, radiation, chemotherapy, and androgen deprivation therapies) within 1 year of diagnosis. We performed bivariable analysis to compare trends in use for EM vs. treatment, stratified by disease risk (i.e., Gleason 3+3, 3+4, 4+3; PSA<10, 10-20) and health status (i.e., NCI Comorbidity Index (NCI), frailty, life expectancy). We then ran a multivariable logistic regression model to examine determinants of EM. RESULTS: Within this cohort, 26,364 (38%) were categorized as low-risk (i.e., Gleason 3+3 and PSA<10) and 43,520 (62%) as intermediate-risk (i.e., all others). Over the study period, use of EM significantly increased across all risk groups, except for Gleason 4+3 (P = 0.662), as well across all health status groups. However, linear trends did not differ significantly between frail vs. nonfrail patients for both those categorized as low-risk (P = 0.446) and intermediate-risk (P = 0.208). Trends also did not differ between NCI 0 vs. 1 vs. >1 for low-risk PCa (P = 0.395). In the multivariable models, EM was associated with increasing age and being frail for men with both low- and intermediate risk disease. Conversely, EM selection was negatively associated with higher comorbidity score. CONCLUSIONS: EM increased significantly over time for patients with low- and favorable intermediate-risk disease, with the most notable differences based on age and Gleason score. In contrast, trends in uptake of EM did not differ substantively by health status, suggesting that physicians may not be effectively incorporating patient health into PCa treatment decisions. Additional work is needed to develop interventions that recognize health status as an essential component of a risk-adapted approach.",0
A role for immune modulation in achieving functional cure for chronic hepatitis B among current changes in the landscape of new treatments.,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is rarely cured using available treatments. Barriers to cure are: 1) persistence of reservoirs of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and antigen production (HBV DNA); 2) high burden of viral antigens that promote T cell exhaustion with T cell dysfunction; 3) CHB-induced impairment of immune responses. AREAS COVERED: We discuss options for new therapies that could address one or more of the barriers to functional cure, with particular emphasis on the potential role of immunotherapy. EXPERT OPINION/COMMENTARY: Ideally, a sterilizing cure for CHB would translate into finite therapies that result in loss of HBV surface antigen and eradication of HBV DNA. Restoration of a functional adaptive immune response, a key facet of successful CHB treatment, remains elusive. Numerous strategies targeting the high viral DNA and antigen burden and aiming to restore the host immune responses will enter clinical development in coming years. Most patients are likely to require combinations of several drugs, personalized according to virologic and disease characteristics, patient preference, accessibility, and affordability. The management of CHB is a global health priority. Expedited drug development requires collaborations between regulatory agencies, scientists, clinicians, and within the industry to facilitate testing of the best drug combinations.",0
Choosing Systemic Agents for Psoriasis.,"Treatment options for moderate-to-severe psoriasis depend on drug efficacy and safety, patient preferences, comorbidities, and cost-no drug dominates across all dimensions. Interleukin (IL)-17 inhibitors may be preferred for fast-acting treatment, while the 3-month schedule of risankizumab, ustekinumab, or tildrakizumab may be attractive for patients who prioritize fewer injections. Phototherapy is suitable for patients who wish to avoid systemic agents or when cost is a concern. For patients with poor adherence, infliximab or tildrakizumab may be well suited as they require in-office administration. Dermatologists can educate patients on available therapies to find a regimen best suited to their needs.",0
Evaluating Patient and Provider Preferences for a Once-Weekly Basal Insulin in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes.,"PURPOSE: The global burden of disease of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is significant, and insulin currently plays a central role in T2D management. This study sought to assess the preferences of patients with T2D and healthcare providers (HCPs) involved in T2D care regarding a hypothetical once-weekly basal insulin in comparison to current basal insulin options. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a survey-based study in the United States that included a discrete choice experiment (DCE), patients with T2D (insulin naïve and current insulin users) and providers who treat individuals with T2D were asked to evaluate current basal insulins and identify attributes of importance regarding a hypothetical once-weekly basal insulin. A regression analysis was conducted to identify drivers of preference by relevant demographics, attitudes, and behaviors. RESULTS: Most respondents (91% of patients with T2D and 89% of HCPs in the base case scenario) would choose a once-weekly basal insulin product over another type of basal insulin. Both patients with T2D and HCPs rated insulin type and delivery method to be attributes of highest importance in the discrete choice exercise. Current basal insulin users (""insulin experienced"") reported higher levels of confidence that a once-weekly insulin would help them to achieve their desired blood sugar levels compared to their current basal insulin (5.7 vs 5.2 on a 7-point Likert scale). Most insulin-experienced respondents (88%) were likely to inquire about once-weekly basal insulin, and most HCPs (85%) indicated willingness to educate patients on management of their T2D using a once-weekly basal insulin. CONCLUSION: Discussing preferences for T2D medication management is important for patients and HCPs to ensure treatments are offered for patients based on their preferences. This study showed that patient and provider preferences are similar towards a once-weekly basal insulin over current basal insulin preparations.",1
Patient Preferences and Perceptions of Provider Diversity in Orthopaedic Surgery.,"BACKGROUND: Orthopaedic surgery in the U.S. historically has been among the least demographically diverse specialties in medicine. Currently, limited data exist on how patients perceive diversity within the field and what patients look for when choosing an orthopaedic surgeon. The purpose of this study was to identify specific patient preferences for surgeon demographics and understand patient perceptions of racial and gender diversity in orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: Nonconsecutive patients from orthopaedic clinics affiliated with a U.S. academic health system voluntarily completed a 39-item questionnaire that surveyed basic demographic information, perception of diversity, racial and gender preferences during surgeon selection, and perception of health-care inequalities. Bivariate analyses were used to test the association between patient-surgeon demographic variables and ratings of diversity. Multiple regression models were used to identify independent predictors of overall perceived diversity ratings. RESULTS: A total of 349 patients (80.6% White, 17.9% Black, and 1.5% other) were analyzed. Black patients were more likely to experience difficulty relating to their surgeon than White patients (11.48% versus 2.29%; odds ratio [OR], 5.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55 to 21.1; p = 0.004). Moreover, Black patients were more likely to perceive racial bias from their surgeon than White patients (5.17% versus 0.37%; OR, 14.44; 95% CI, 1.14 to 766.29; p = 0.02). While the level of racial diversity perceived by White patients (2.57 of 10) was significantly higher than that perceived by Black patients (2.10 of 10) (p = 0.001), the absolute difference between these 2 figures was small, suggesting that both groups perceived racial diversity in orthopaedics to be low. White and Black patients differed in their importance ranking of a surgeon's race (p < 0.0001): Black patients ranked a surgeon's race with higher importance (mean, 3.49 of 10) when selecting a surgeon compared with White patients (1.45 of 10). Both male and female patients gave relatively low importance rankings for a surgeon's gender (mean, 1.58 of 10 and 2.15 of 10, respectively, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients in this study did not perceive orthopaedic surgery as a diverse field (overall diversity rating, <3 of 10). There were significant racial and gender differences in patients' preferences for specific physician characteristics when choosing an orthopaedic surgeon, which may help explain some instances of perceived racial bias and difficulty relating to their orthopaedic surgeon.",0
Management reasoning and patient-clinician interactions: Insights from shared decision-making and simulated outpatient encounters.,"PURPOSE: To expand understanding of patient-clinician interactions in management reasoning. METHODS: We reviewed 10 videos of simulated patient-clinician encounters to identify instances of problematic and successful communication, then reviewed the videos again through the lens of two models of shared decision-making (SDM): an 'involvement-focused' model and a 'problem-focused' model. Using constant comparative qualitative analysis we explored the connections between these patient-clinician interactions and management reasoning. RESULTS: Problems in patient-clinician interactions included failures to: encourage patient autonomy; invite the patient's involvement in decision-making; convey the health impact of the problem; explore and address concerns and questions; explore the context of decision-making (including patient preferences); meet the patient where they are; integrate situational preferences and priorities; offer >1 viable option; work with the patient to solve a problem of mutual concern; explicitly agree to a final care plan; and build the patient-clinician relationship. Clinicians' 'management scripts' varied along a continuum of prioritizing clinician vs patient needs. Patients also have their own cognitive scripts that guide their interactions with clinicians. The involvement-focused and problem-focused SDM models illuminated distinct, complementary issues. CONCLUSIONS: Management reasoning is a deliberative interaction occurring in the space between individuals. Juxtaposing management reasoning alongside SDM generated numerous insights.",0
Intra-gastric balloon with lifestyle modification: a promising therapeutic option for overweight and obese patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"BACKGROUND: Data on effects of intra-gastric balloon (IGB) on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) are scarce, in part with contradictory results, and mainly obtained in tertiary care patients with diabetes and other comorbidities. We here explore effects of IGB in patients with MASLD referred to a first-line obesity clinic. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, patients with at least significant fibrosis (≥ F2) and/or severe steatosis (S3) according to screening transient elastography (FibroScan®) were offered a second FibroScan® after 6 months lifestyle modification with or without IGB (based on patient preference). RESULTS: 50 of 100 consecutively screened patients (generally non-diabetic) qualified for repeated evaluation and 29 (58%) of those had a second FibroScan®. At baseline, at least significant fibrosis was present in 28% and severe steatosis in 91%. IGB was placed in 19 patients (59%), whereas 10 patients (41%) preferred only lifestyle modification (no differences in baseline characteristics between both groups). After 6 months, liver stiffness decreased markedly in the IGB group (median: from 6.0 to 4.9 kPa, p = 0.005), but not in the lifestyle modification only group (median: from 5.5 to 6.9 kPa, p = 0.477). Steatosis improved in both groups, (controlled attenuation parameter values; IGB, mean ± SD: from 328 ± 34 to 272 ± 62 dB/m, p = 0.006: lifestyle modification only, mean ± SD: from 344 ± 33 to 305 ± 43 dB/m: p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Both steatosis and fibrosis improve markedly in overweight/obese patients with MASLD after 6 months IGB combined with lifestyle modification. Our results warrant further research into long-term effect of IGB in these patients.",0
"Effectiveness of telehealth-based exercise interventions on pain, physical function and quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis: A meta-analysis.","OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of telehealth-based exercise intervention on pain, physical function and quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Six databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PEDro and Web of Science Core Collection) were searched for relevant randomised controlled trials published from database inception to 3 June 2021. Reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted data and used the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool for quality assessment. A meta-analysis and subgroup analyses, stratified by control condition, intervention duration and delivery type, were conducted by Revman 5.4. The study was reported in compliance with PRISMA statement. RESULTS: A total of 9 independent RCTs with 861 participants were included. The meta-analysis showed that the telehealth-based exercise interventions significantly reduced pain in KOA patients (SMD = -0.28, 95% CI [-0.49, -0.08], p < .01) and produced similar effects to controls in terms of physical function and quality of life. Subgroup analysis revealed that telehealth-based exercise interventions were superior to the use of exercise booklet and usual care in terms of pain and physical function and were similar to face-to-face exercise treatment; a long-term (>3 months) intervention and the use of web and smartphone APPs to deliver exercise interventions were associated with better pain relief and physical function. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth-based exercise intervention is an effective strategy for KOA management during the COVID-19 epidemic, and it is significantly better than usual care in reducing knee pain and improving physical function and was able to achieve the effects of traditional face-to-face exercise treatment. Although the duration and type of delivery associated with the effect of the intervention have been identified, patient preference and acceptability need to be considered in practice.",0
Hybrid Cardiac Rehabilitation Program in a Low-Resource Setting: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"IMPORTANCE: While effective, cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR) as traditionally delivered is not well implemented in lower-resource settings. OBJECTIVE: To test the noninferiority of hybrid CR compared with traditional CR in terms of cardiovascular events. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pragmatic, multicenter, parallel arm, open-label randomized clinical trial (the Hybrid Cardiac Rehabilitation Trial [HYCARET]) with blinded outcome assessment was conducted at 6 referral centers in Chile. Adults aged 18 years or older who had a cardiovascular event or procedure, no contraindications to exercise, and access to a mobile telephone were eligible and recruited between April 1, 2019, and March 15, 2020, with follow-up until July 29, 2021. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 1:1 in permuted blocks to the experimental arm, which received 10 center-based supervised exercise sessions plus counseling in 4 to 6 weeks and then were supported at home via telephone calls and text messages through weeks 8 to 12, or the control arm, which received the standard CR of 18 to 22 sessions with exercises and education in 8 to 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was cardiovascular events or mortality. Secondary outcomes were quality of life, return to work, and lifestyle behaviors measured with validated questionnaires; muscle strength and functional capacity, measured through physical tests; and program adherence and exercise-related adverse events, assessed using checklists. RESULTS: A total of 191 participants were included (mean [SD] age, 58.74 [9.80] years; 145 [75.92%] male); 93 were assigned to hybrid CR and 98 to standard CR. At 1 year, events had occurred in 5 unique participants in the hybrid CR group (5.38%) and 9 in the standard CR group (9.18%). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the hybrid CR group had 3.80% (95% CI, -11.13% to 3.52%) fewer cardiovascular events than the standard CR group, and relative risk was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.20-1.68) for the primary outcome. In the per-protocol analysis at different levels of adherence to the intervention, all 95% CIs crossed the noninferiority boundary (eg, 20% adherence: absolute risk difference, -0.35% [95% CI, -7.56% to 6.85%]; 80% adherence: absolute risk difference, 3.30% [95% CI, -3.70% to 10.31%]). No between-group differences were found for secondary outcomes except adherence to supervised CR sessions (79.14% [736 of 930 supervised sessions] in the hybrid CR group vs 61.46% [1201 of 1954 sessions] in the standard CR group). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results suggest that a hybrid CR program is noninferior to standard center-based CR in a low-resource setting, primarily in terms of recurrent cardiovascular events and potentially in terms of intermediate outcomes. Hybrid CR may induce superior adherence to supervised exercise. Clinical factors and patient preferences should inform CR model allocation.

Quantifying Benefit-Risk Trade-Offs Toward Prophylactic Treatment Among Adult Patients With Hemophilia A in China: Discrete Choice Experiment Study.,"BACKGROUND: Hemophilia A is a chronic condition that requires meticulous treatment and management. Patient preferences for prophylactic treatment can substantially influence adherence, outcomes, and quality of life, yet these preferences remain underexplored, particularly in China. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the preferences for prophylactic treatment among Chinese adult patients with hemophilia A without inhibitors, considering clinical effectiveness, side effects, dosing mode, and dosing frequency. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was used to elicit patient preferences for prophylactic treatment of hemophilia. The study was conducted across 7 provinces in China with socioeconomic and geographical diversity. Subgroup analysis was performed according to education level, geographic location, and treatment type, alongside the exploration of benefit-risk trade-offs. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients completed the discrete choice experiment questionnaire, and we included 102 responses for analysis based on predetermined exclusion criteria. The study found that patients prioritized reducing annual bleeding times and avoiding the risk of developing inhibitors over treatment process attributes. Subgroup analysis revealed that lower-educated patients and those from rural areas attached more importance to the dosing mode, likely due to barriers to self-administration. Patients demonstrated a clear understanding of benefit-risk trade-offs, exhibiting a willingness to accept an increased risk of developing inhibitors for improved clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides valuable insights into the preferences of patients with hemophilia A for prophylactic treatment in China. Understanding these preferences can enhance shared decision-making between patients and clinicians, fostering personalized prophylactic treatment plans that may optimize adherence and improve clinical outcomes.",1
Shared decision making in patients with kidney failure.,"'Elderly' is most commonly defined as an individual aged 65 years or older. However, this definition fails to account for the differences in genetics, lifestyle and overall health that contribute to significant heterogeneity among the elderly beyond chronological age. As the world population continues to age, the prevalence of chronic diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), is increasing and CKD frequently progresses to kidney failure. Moreover, frailty represents a multidimensional clinical entity highly prevalent in this population, which needs to be adequately assessed to inform and support medical decisions. Selecting the optimal treatment pathway for the elderly and frail kidney failure population, be it hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or conservative kidney management is complex, because of the presence of comorbidities associated with low survival rates and impaired quality of life. Management of these patients should involve a multidisciplinary approach including doctors from various specialties, nurses, psychologists, dieticians, and physiotherapists. Studies are mostly retrospective and observational, lacking adjustment for confounders or address selection and indication biases, making it difficult to use these data to guide treatment decisions. Throughout this review we discuss the difficulty of making a one-size-fits-all recommendation for the clinical needs of older patients with kidney failure. We advocate that a research agenda for optimization of the critical issues we present in this review be implemented. We recommend prospective studies that address these issues, and systematic reviews incorporating the complementary evidence of both observational and interventional studies. Furthermore, we strongly support a shared decision making process matching evidence with patient preferences to ensure that individualized choices are made regarding dialysis vs. conservative kidney management, dialysis modality, and optimal vascular access.",0
Implementing telemedicine in urogynecology: A feasibility study.,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Telemedicine has been recommended for the management of urogynecological conditions during the coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of telemedicine for urogynecology at a Brazilian public hospital. METHODS: A descriptive observational study was performed at a urogynecology outpatient clinic. The primary outcome was the desire to continue with telemedicine. Secondary outcomes were appointment resolvability, technical aspects of the appointment, and patient satisfaction. The participants had in-person appointments that were canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected data on sociodemographic characteristics and clinical and technical aspects of the appointments. The participants responded to satisfaction questionnaires 7-15 days post-procedure. The categorical variables were evaluated based on absolute and relative frequency. The continuous variables were described as the mean and standard deviation. A chi-square test was performed to determine the association between variables. RESULTS: In total, 225 patients had appointments canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, of which 171 were eligible for the study. Telemedicine appointments were agreed upon by 48% of the participants and 85.5% responded to the satisfaction survey. We found that 57.7% of the participants desired to continue with telemedicine. The appointment resolvability rate was 76.1%, 63.4% of the appointments met the technical criteria, and the satisfaction rate was 93%. The only variable associated with the desire to continue telemedicine was overall patient satisfaction (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine in urogynecology is feasible and can be implemented in the studied population. However, actions are essential to adequately support patient preference and improve the acceptance of telemedicine.",0
"Proportion of medical admissions that may be hospitalised at home and their service utilisation patterns: a single-centre, descriptive retrospective cohort study in Singapore.","OBJECTIVES: For eligible patient groups, hospital-at-home (HaH) programmes have been shown to deliver equivalent patient outcomes with cost reduction compared with standard care. This study aims to establish a benchmark of inpatient admissions that could potentially be substituted by HaH services. DESIGN: Descriptive retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Academic tertiary hospital in Singapore. PARTICIPANTS: 124 253 medical admissions over 20 months (January 2016 to August 2017). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure was the proportion of hospitalised patients who may be eligible for HaH, based on eligibility criteria adapted for the Singapore context. The secondary measures were the utilisation patterns and outcomes of these patients. RESULTS: Applying generalised eligibility criteria to the retrospective dataset showed that 53.0% of 124 253 medical admissions fitted the eligibility criteria for HaH based on administrative data. 46.8% of such patients had a length of stay <48 hours ('short-stay') and 53.1% had a length of stay ≥48 hours ('medium-stay'). The mortality rate and the 30-day readmission rate were lower in the 'short-stay' cohort (0.6%, 12.8%) compared with the 'medium-stay' cohort (0.7%, 20.3%). The key services used by both groups were: parenteral drug administration, blood investigations, imaging procedures and consultations with allied health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 53.0% of medical admissions receive care elements that HaH programmes could provide. Applying estimates of functional limitations and patient preferences, we propose a target of ~18% of inpatient medical admissions to be substituted by HaH services. The methodology adopted in this paper is a reproducible approach to characterise potential patients and service utilisation requirements when developing such programmes.",0
Understanding Treatment Preferences Among People Living with HIV in Australia: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"PURPOSE: To better understand what is most important to people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) when choosing their treatment. We assessed how PLWH trade off the potential risks and benefits of oral and long acting injectable (LAI) treatments. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Firstly, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 PLWH to develop a holistic understanding of experiences and determine attributes that contribute to treatment decision-making. Secondly, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) was used to understand the treatment preferences for PLWH with n = 99 PLWH aged 18 years or over with a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and who were currently using anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Study participants were presented with 12 scenarios and asked to select their preferred treatment among two hypothetical injectable treatment alternatives, ""injection 1"" and ""injection 2"" and their current oral ART treatment. The DCE data were modelled using a latent class model (LCM). RESULTS: The model revealed significant heterogeneity in preferences for treatment attributes among study participants. Two segments/classes of PLWH were identified. The first segment expressed a strong preference for their current oral treatment; the second segment showed strong preference for the injection treatment and for it to be administered in a GP clinic. Overall, out-of-pocket cost was the most important attribute for participants. One-third of PLWH were willing to switch to an LAI. CONCLUSION: Not all PLWH valued the same treatment attributes equally. Overall, out-of-pocket costs for treatments were considered by respondents as the most determining factor in making treatment choices. Results have important implications for healthcare policy and will serve to better inform patients and stakeholders involved in the treatment decision-making process about the treatment preferences of PLWH. Clinicians are encouraged to consider shared decision-making to establish the treatment course that best aligns with PLWH's treatment goals.",1
Forensic Medical Examination After Sexual Violence: Implications Based on Victims' Perceptions.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The objective of this study was to assess the perception of the forensic medical examination (FME) by victims of sexual violence. Based on patient-related outcomes gained in terms of personnel, chronological and spatial parameters, an additional aim was to derive improved examination procedures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 49 sexually assaulted women were enrolled in this study. After standardized FME by a forensic doctor followed by a gynecologist, women were asked to complete a questionnaire addressing general perception, preferences regarding attending staff's sex, sequence and time frame of the examinations performed. The attending gynecologist also completed a questionnaire addressing demographic and medical parameters of the patient as well as assault-related information. RESULTS: The examination setting in general was evaluated positively. Nevertheless, 52% of examined victims perceived the FME as an additional psychological burden. Overall, 85% of the affected women preferred a female forensic physician and 76% a female gynecologist to perform the examination. When women said they experienced a violation of their privacy during the gynecological examination, a male was more often present (60% vs. 35%, p=0.0866). Regarding the sequence of the examination components, 65% of the victims preferred to start with their medical history followed by the forensic and then the gynecological examination. CONCLUSION: Forensic medical and gynecological examination after sexual assault is an essential procedure, yet it is a potentially further traumatizing experience for the victim. The identified patient preferences should be taken into account in order to diminish further trauma.",0
Comparative study between mitomycin C versus Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) in high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the efficacy and adverse events of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) versus Mitomycin C (MMC) in high-risk Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) patients. METHODS: This randomized controlled study was conducted over 24 months in four hospitals in Egypt. A sample of 90 patients was randomly assigned to either treatment group, with procedures including baseline examinations, a single postoperative instillation of chemotherapy, a 6-week induction cycle of the assigned drug, and regular follow-up cystoscopies and upper urinary tract imaging. Treatment results and side effects were monitored, with data analyzed via Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in mean age or tumor characteristics (p > 0.05). However, adverse reactions were significantly higher in the BCG group, including cystitis (40% vs. 17.78%, p = 0.020), hematuria (24.44% vs. 4.44%, p = 0.007), overall local reactions (75.56% vs. 26.67%, p < 0.001), fever (13.33% vs. 2.22%, p = 0.049), and fatigue (17.78% vs. 2.22%, p = 0.014). The MMC group had a slightly higher recurrence rate (28.89% vs. 17.78%, hazard ratio 1.89, 95% CI: 0.78-4.55, p = 0.15) with a shorter median time to recurrence (six vs. 12 months). Progression rates were similar (8.89% MMC vs. 4.44% BCG, p = 0.398). CONCLUSION: Although BCG and MMC have comparable efficacy in managing high-risk NMIBC, BCG demonstrated a higher rate of adverse reactions. Decision-making should consider this balance, patient preferences, and health status. Further research is needed for the validation and exploration of these findings.",0
U.S. patient preferences for long-acting HIV treatment: a discrete choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Recent advances in long-acting antiretroviral therapy (LA-ART) could provide new options for HIV treatment and reduce adherence barriers, if regimens are acceptable to patients. We elicited preferences for key attributes of potential LA-ART regimens among people with HIV (PWH) in the United States, focusing on four treatment modes (oral tablets, subcutaneous injections, intramuscular injections, and implants), product characteristics and location of administration. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was conducted among PWH aged ≥18 years recruited from HIV clinics in Washington State and Atlanta, Georgia from March 2021 to June 2022. Participants responded to 17 choice scenarios, each with three options: two systematically generated hypothetical LA-ART regimens and a constant opt-out (their current daily oral treatment). LA-ART regimen descriptions included treatment mode, pain, dosing frequency, location, pre-treatment time with undetectable viral load, pre-treatment negative reaction testing and ""late-dose leeway"" (i.e. flexibility or forgiveness in timing the next dose). We used conditional logistic regression, with an interaction between treatment mode and pain, to estimate preference weights for all attribute levels. RESULTS: Seven hundred participants (350 at each site) enrolled, with median age 51 years (range 18-73); 70% identified as cisgender male, 24% as cisgender female and 6% as non-binary or transgender. LA oral tablets were the only mode preferred over current daily oral treatment, with annual implants and injections the next most preferred LA-ART option. Longer time between doses was preferred, and administration at home was preferred to clinics, which were preferred to pharmacies. Attributes with less impact on preferences included oral lead-in treatment to achieve viral suppression or test for negative reactions and late-dose leeway around the prescribed dosing interval. Participants in Atlanta were more likely to prefer their current daily oral ART than participants from Seattle. CONCLUSIONS: PWH in the United States may soon have several options for LA-ART. Our results suggest that LA oral tablets will be preferred by many patients over their current daily oral treatment, while implants and injections with longer duration may be acceptable to some. Future research should investigate sources of preference heterogeneity and actual uptake of and adherence to LA-ART products, when available.",1
The preferences of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis on riluzole treatment in Europe.,"The Patient Preference Survey aims to understand unmet needs related to riluzole management in people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and to identify which characteristics of a new formulation could better match their preferences. The survey involved 117 people with ALS (PALS) treated with riluzole in four European countries. The dysphagic PALS were least satisfied with the riluzole tablet and oral suspension and with ease in self-administration; up to 68% of respondents postponed or missed the treatment due to swallowing difficulties and need of caregiver assistance. Overall, 51% of tablet and 53% of oral suspension users regularly crushed or mixed riluzole with beverages, respectively; PALS who always manipulated riluzole showed low satisfaction with the formulation and considered the risk of choking and pneumonia the most worrisome event. The survey evaluated the driving factors in choosing/switching the therapy: 67% of PALS declared a low risk of choking. The research finally evaluated which attributes of a new formulation would be preferred: the most relevant were ease of use (4.3/5), convenient/portable packaging (4.0/5) and oral-dissolving properties without tongue motility (3.9/5). The Patient Preference Survey suggests that patients have several unmet needs and preferences that could be addressed by a different formulation, e.g. using oral film technologies.",0
"Increased versus conventional adalimumab dose interval for patients with Crohn's disease in stable remission (LADI): a pragmatic, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Despite its effectiveness in treating Crohn's disease, adalimumab is associated with an increased risk of infections and high health-care costs. We aimed to assess clinical outcomes of increased adalimumab dose intervals versus conventional dosing in patients with Crohn's disease in stable remission. METHODS: The LADI study was a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority, parallel, randomised controlled trial, done in six academic hospitals and 14 general hospitals in the Netherlands. Adults (aged ≥18 years) diagnosed with luminal Crohn's disease (with or without concomitant perianal disease) were eligible when in steroid-free clinical and biochemical remission (defined as Harvey-Bradshaw Index [HBI] score <5, faecal calprotectin <150 μg/g, and C-reactive protein <10 mg/L) for at least 9 months on a stable dose of 40 mg subcutaneous adalimumab every 2 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to the intervention group or control group by the coordinating investigator using a secure web-based system with variable block randomisation (block sizes of 6, 9, and 12). Randomisation was stratified on concomitant use of thiopurines and methotrexate. Patients and health-care providers were not masked to group assignment. Patients allocated to the intervention group increased adalimumab dose intervals to 40 mg every 3 weeks at baseline and further to every 4 weeks if they remained in clinical and biochemical remission at week 24. Patients in the control group continued their 2-weekly dose interval. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of persistent flares at week 48 defined as the presence of at least two of the following criteria: HBI score of 5 or more, C-reactive protein 10 mg/L or more, and faecal calprotectin more than 250 μg/g for more than 8 weeks and a concurrent decrease in the adalimumab dose interval or start of escape medication. The non-inferiority margin was 15% on a risk difference scale. All analyses were done in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03172377, and is not recruiting. FINDINGS: Between May 3, 2017, and July 6, 2020, 174 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n=113) or the control group (n=61). Four patients from the intervention group and one patient from the control group were excluded from the analysis for not meeting inclusion criteria. 85 (50%) of 169 participants were female and 84 (50%) were male. At week 48, the cumulative incidence of persistent flares in the intervention group (three [3%] of 109) was non-inferior compared with the control group (zero; pooled adjusted risk difference 1·86% [90% CI -0·35 to 4·07). Seven serious adverse events occurred, all in the intervention group, of which two (both patients with intestinal obstruction) were possibly related to the intervention. Per 100 person-years, 168·35 total adverse events, 59·99 infection-related adverse events, and 42·57 gastrointestinal adverse events occurred in the intervention group versus 134·67, 75·03, and 5·77 in the control group, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The individual benefit of increasing adalimumab dose intervals versus the risk of disease recurrence is a trade-off that should take patient preferences regarding medication and the risk of a flare into account.

Food Allergy Management Practices Utilizing Individual Patient Thresholds: A Work Group Report of the AAAAI Adverse Reactions to Foods Committee.,"The paradigm for food allergy management has been strict avoidance of the food allergen. There is literature supporting a ""high-threshold"" phenotype, those who tolerate a small-to-modest amount of allergen but react to larger amounts. There is no consensus for best practice for these ""high-threshold"" individuals. We sought to understand management practices of ""high-threshold"" reactors using a survey that was distributed to a random sample of fellows and members of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. There were 89 respondents from the United States and Canada (11% response rate), with 64 (72%) answering all questions. Participants worked in private (52%) and academic practice (38%) and saw a median of 30 food allergic patients monthly. Eighty-one percent of respondents reported management strategies other than strict avoidance. When threshold was known, strategies ranged from allowing ingestion up to a specified amount (57%), proactively advising ingestion to a certain amount (56%), or oral immunotherapy (47%). Participants were more likely to choose a permissive approach for a mild reaction in a high-threshold milk-allergic patient compared with a peanut-allergic patient (83% vs 71%, p=.01). Important factors that influenced the approach included severity of reaction (52%), comfort with family/patient using emergency medications (42%), and family/patient preferences (41%). These survey results suggest that food allergy management recommendations are no longer binary in nature, with clinicians solely recommending avoidance for those who are allergic and ingestion for those who may not be.",0
Clinician communication strategies to navigate differences of opinion with patients.,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated communication strategies clinicians reported using to navigate differences of opinion with patients regarding medical decisions. METHODS: Twenty physicians of various specialties participated in semi-structured interviews regarding their strategies for maintaining mutual respect when disagreeing with a patient. Reflexive thematic analysis was applied. Enrollment concluded upon theme saturation. RESULTS: In an attempt to limit disagreements, physicians learned to gauge patient values, often deferring to clinicians being the expert on medicine and patients being the expert on themselves. Physicians noticed that disagreements were reinforced by prioritizing educational approaches. Strengthening the relationship by validating patient emotions was seen as a more effective strategy. Clinicians found it difficult to weigh relative potential for benefit to the relationship and feelings of moral distress in capitulating to patient preferences they disagreed with. CONCLUSION: Physicians recognized the value of moving from educational to relationship building strategies to help limit and navigate disagreements. Key strategies include prioritizing gauging the patient's values and validating their emotions. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Anticipating disagreement, training clinicians to limit teaching, and instead prioritize a strong relationship to maintain trust and collaboration has the potential to improve patient health, with more limited resource use, and better experiences of care.",0
Preferences and decisional considerations relating to opioid agonist therapy among Ukrainian people who use drugs: A conjoint analysis survey.,"Scaling up opioid agonist therapies (OAT) is the most effective strategy to control combined HIV and opioid epidemics, especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA), where HIV incidence and mortality continue to increase. Patient concerns about OAT, however, have undermined scale-up. The objective of this study is to understand Ukrainian opioid use disorder patient preferences about OAT to guide the development of an evidence-informed decision aid for clinical decision-making. We conducted a conjoint-based choice (CBC) survey. Participants were asked to about their preferences relating to 7 attributes of OAT (cost, dosing frequency, concerns about withdrawal symptoms, adverse side effects, improvements in quality of life, precipitation of withdrawal and legislative requirements to be registered as a drug dependent person) and 20 attribute levels for receiving OAT under differing potential treatment constraints. Data were analyzed using Hierarchical Bayesian models. Using respondent-driven sampling and random sampling, we recruited 2,028 people who inject drugs with opioid use disorder. Relative importance (RIS) and partial-worth utility scores (PWUS) were used to assess preferences for attributes and thresholds within each attribute. Cost and dosing frequency were the most important attributes (RIS = 39.2% and RIS = 25.2%, respectively) to potential patients, followed by concerns about withdrawal symptoms (RIS = 10.8%), adverse side effects (RIS = 9.0%), quality-of-life improvement (RIS = 7.5%), precipitation of euphoria (5.2%) and requirement to be registered as a drug- dependent person (RIS = 3.1%). The monthly cost-threshold for willingness-to-pay was 1,900 UAH ($70 USD). In Ukraine, where both governmental and private OAT clinics have emerged and provide markedly different delivery strategies, preferences are mostly driven by out-of-pocket expenses, despite many patients being willing to pay for OAT. Programmatic demands (flexibility and ease of acquiring medications) remain an important consideration while for a minority, clinical concerns about withdrawal symptoms, adverse side effects and OAT impact on life play a smaller role.",1
Needle Arthroscopy for Osteochondral Lesions of the First Metatarsophalangeal Joint: A Standardized Approach.,"Cartilage and osteochondral lesions of the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP-1) joint are characterized by pain during weight bearing and walking. The lesions often require surgical intervention(s). Arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation may be considered the preferred operative intervention for small lesions. Technological advances, patient preferences, and economic considerations combine to foster the development of minimally invasive needle arthroscopic procedures. This technical note presents and highlights our minimally invasive surgical technique for needle arthroscopic treatment through bone marrow stimulation for osteochondral lesions of the MTP-1 joint.",0
Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: What do the current USPSTF guidelines say?,"The 2022 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation notes that the decision to initiate daily aspirin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) should be made on a case-by-case basis for adults ages 40 to 59 with a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk. The recommendation applies to those without signs or symptoms of clinically evident CVD who are not at an increased risk of bleeding. Clinicians are encouraged to use their judgment in weighing the risks and benefits of aspirin therapy, while taking patient preference into account for patients ages 40 to 60.",0
Termination counseling among US perinatal genetic counselors in the setting of second trimester fetal anomalies.,"Many pregnant people learn of fetal anomalies in the second trimester and subsequently present to prenatal genetic counselors (PGCs) for counseling, including but not limited to a nuanced discussion about whether to continue or terminate pregnancy. In those who choose to terminate, the decision between dilation and evacuation (D&E) or induction is often one of patient preference and as such, is heavily influenced by the quality of counseling received. PGCs are expertly trained to provide values-based counseling, yet little is known about their termination counseling practices, referral practice patterns, and perceived responsibilities in caring for this group of pregnant people. To gain this knowledge, we surveyed a national sample of PGCs in early 2022 and received 70 completed responses. The survey contained open- and closed-ended questions. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and free response data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Eighty percent (n = 56) of respondents reported that <50% of their patients had previously received termination options counseling. Most strikingly, 15% of respondents provided termination counseling that was beyond their self-identified comfort level. Scenario-based questions assessed respondents' counseling practice patterns in seven real-world situations, presented in order of decreasing severity for the fetus. Respondents were 50% less likely to provide termination options counseling to patients between the most lethal to the least lethal proposed fetal anomaly. The scenario-based analysis revealed two distinct termination counseling approaches: (1) all options counseling with an explicit discussion of options to continue or terminate and (2) discretionary options counseling focused on identifying patient preferences to guide counseling and not explicitly stating all available options. This study highlights the need to ensure PGCs feel well-trained to discuss the general features of second trimester pregnancy termination and, if unable to do so, to practice in systems with timely referral to providers well-versed in the counseling about all methods of termination.",0
"POLST recall, concordance, and decision quality outcomes among nursing home residents and surrogate decision-makers.","BACKGROUND: POLST orders are actionable in an emergency, so it is important that the decisions be of high quality and concordant with current preferences. The goal of this study is to determine the relationship between concordance and decision quality outcomes, including decision satisfaction and decisional conflict, among nursing facility residents and surrogates who recall POLST. METHODS: We completed structured interviews in 29 nursing facilities with 275 participants who had previously signed a POLST form. This included residents who were still making their own medical decisions (n = 123) and surrogate decision-makers for residents without decisional capacity (n = 152). POLST recall was defined as remembering talking about and/or completing the POLST form previously signed by the participant. Concordance was determined by comparing preferences elicited during a standardized interview with the POLST form on file. Decisional conflict, decision satisfaction, and conversation quality were assessed with standardized tools. RESULTS: Half of participants (50%) remembered talking about or completing the POLST form, but recall was not associated with the length of time since POLST completion or concordance with existing preferences. In multivariable analyses, there was no association between POLST recall, concordance, and decision quality outcomes, though satisfaction was associated with conversation quality. CONCLUSIONS: Half of the residents and surrogates in this study recalled the POLST they previously signed. Neither the age of the form nor the ability to recall the POLST conversation should be considered indicators of whether existing POLST orders match current preferences. Findings confirm a relationship between POLST conversation quality and satisfaction, underscoring the importance of POLST completion as a communication process.",0
