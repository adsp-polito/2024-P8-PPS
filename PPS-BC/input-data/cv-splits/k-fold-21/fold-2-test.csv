Whether preferences of gastric cancer patients after surgery for follow-up change over time? Analysis based on discrete choice experiment.,"PURPOSES: The purposes of this discrete choice experiment are as follows: (1) quantify the relevant characteristics that may affect the follow-up selection of gastric cancer patients after surgery and (2) explore the differences in follow-up preferences of gastric cancer patients at different stages and reveal the change trend of preferences over time, thereby providing references for the formulation and optimization of follow-up strategies. METHODS: A survey instrument that was developed using the design principle of a discrete choice experiment investigated gastric cancer patients on the day of discharge, and at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after discharge. In Stata 15.0, a mixed logit model was used to explore the preferences of gastric cancer patients after surgery at different stages, the willingness to pay was calculated, and the NLCOM command was used to simulate the follow-up uptake rates of different attribute levels at different stages. RESULTS: On the day of discharge, and 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after discharge, the most important attribute levels of gastric cancer patients after surgery were ""thoroughness-very thorough,"" ""method-face-to-face,"" ""thoroughness-very thorough,"" and ""provider-specialist nurse,"" respectively, and patients were willing to pay more for these services. Patients' preference for the attribute level ""very thorough"" decreased over time, while their preferences for ""specialist doctors"" as follow-up providers remained relatively stable. Furthermore, the attribute levels with the greatest effect on receiving the baseline follow-up program varied across stages. CONCLUSION: The gastric cancer patients' preferences for follow-up change over time, and the time factor should be considered when developing follow-up strategies.",1
"Patient experience in community health services and first choice for medical attention: A cross-sectional study in Wuhan, China.","OBJECTIVES: In China, it is up to the patients to choose between hospitals and primary care facilities to initiate their medical care. This study aimed to determine the association between patient experience with community health centres (CHCs, a predominant provider of community-based primary care) and patient preference of taking community-based primary care facilities as a first choice for medical attention. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted on 1919 patients who sought medical care in 55 CHCs in Wuhan, China. Respondents were asked to identify their preferred first choice for medical attention and rate their satisfaction with eight aspects of CHCs (basic facility, medical equipment, medical services, nursing services, treatment process, courtesy and responsiveness, time spent with medical doctor, pharmacy services). Multivariate logistic regression models were established to determine the association between the CHC experience and the first choice of providers after adjustment for variations in sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Over 90% of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with the eight aspects of CHCs; but only 75% preferred to take community-based primary care facilities as their first choice for medical attention. Those who were older and had a lower income were more likely to choose community-based primary care facilities. Geographic proximity and higher levels of satisfaction with the basic facility, courtesy and responsiveness, and pharmacy services in the CHCs were associated with a higher likelihood of taking community-based primary care facilities as a first choice for medical attention. CONCLUSION: The consumers of CHCs are generally satisfied with the services they received. However, one quarter of the CHC patients are yet to be convinced to accept community-based primary care facilities as a preferred first provider for medical care. Geographic proximity and patient experience with CHCs are associated with the patient choice.",0
Coping with COVID: Performance of China's hierarchical medical system during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the health system worldwide. This study aimed to assess how China's hierarchical medical system (HMS) coped with COVID-19 in the short-and medium-term. We mainly measured the number and distribution of hospital visits and healthcare expenditure between primary and high-level hospitals during Beijing's 2020-2021 pandemic relative to the 2017-2019 pre-COVID-19 benchmark period. METHODS: Hospital operational data were extracted from Municipal Health Statistics Information Platform. The COVID-19 period in Beijing was divided into five phases, corresponding to different characteristics, from January 2020 to October 2021. The main outcome measures in this study include the percentage change in inpatient and outpatient emergency visits, and surgeries, and changing distribution of patients between different hospital levels across Beijing's HMS. In addition, the corresponding health expenditure in each of the 5 phases of COVID-19 was also included. RESULTS: In the outbreak phase of the pandemic, the total visits of Beijing hospitals declined dramatically, where outpatient visits fell 44.6%, inpatients visits fell 47.9%; emergency visits fell 35.6%, and surgery inpatients fell 44.5%. Correspondingly, health expenditures declined 30.5% for outpatients and 43.0% for inpatients. The primary hospitals absorbed a 9.51% higher proportion of outpatients than the pre-COVID-19 level in phase 1. In phase 4, the number of patients, including non-local outpatients reached pre-pandemic 2017-2019 benchmark levels. The proportion of outpatients in primary hospitals was only 1.74% above pre-COVID-19 levels in phases 4 and 5. Health expenditure for both outpatients and inpatients reached the baseline level in phase 3 and increased nearly 10% above pre-COVID-19 levels in phases 4 and 5. CONCLUSION: The HMS in Beijing coped with the COVID-19 pandemic in a relatively short time, the early stage of the pandemic reflected an enhanced role for primary hospitals in the HMS, but did not permanently change patient preferences for high-level hospitals. Relative to the pre-COVID-19 benchmark, the elevated hospital expenditure in phase 4 and phase 5 pointed to hospital over-treatment or patient excess treatment demand. We suggest improving the service capacity of primary hospitals and changing the preferences of patients through health education in the post-COVID-19 world.",0
Physical therapist clinical reasoning in home care for walking assistive device prescription: A description of practice.,"BACKGROUND: Home care in the United States (US) provides rehabilitative care to people who are homebound after acute hospitalization. Patients with stroke and brain injury (BI) are commonly seen by physical therapists (PTs/PTAs), who often address the loss of walking independence. Clinical reasoning (CR) is required for walking assistive device (WAD) prescription within the home. There has never been a description of the home care PT CR process, which could inform entry-level training and health policy. PURPOSE: To describe the homecare CR process by identifying factors used for prescription of WADs in patients with stroke and BI. Secondly, to describe any practice issues associated with WADs. METHODS: Directors of 7 agencies affiliated with Nazareth College DPT program were recruited to identify PTs/PTAs to complete an online survey between March - July 2017. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected, and analyzed for frequencies or for common themes. RESULTS: A total of 334 PTs/PTAs were enrolled from all agencies and 72 responses were analyzed. The CR process did not differ between stroke and BI. Safety was the primary factor, which was assessed by patient query, observation skills, and objective measures. PTs/PTAs also measured balance, strength, function, cognition, and patient preferences within the context of the home. WADs obtained prior to initiation of home care often weren't used. CONCLUSION: A complex CR process has been described for WAD prescription in home care for patients with stroke and BI. Entry-level training and health policy implications are described.",0
Physiotherapists should apply health coaching techniques and incorporate accountability to foster adherence to a walking program for low back pain: aÂ qualitative study.,"QUESTIONS: What motivates individuals to start a walking program for the prevention of low back pain? What strategies optimise short-term and long-term adherence to a walking program? What strategies can physiotherapists incorporate into clinical practice to facilitate commencement of and adherence to a walking program? DESIGN: Qualitative study. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two adults recently recovered from an episode of non-specific low back pain who participated in a 6-month, progressive and individualised walking program that was prescribed by a physiotherapist trained in health coaching. METHODS: Semi-structured focus groups conducted online following completion of the walking program. Interview questions explored: primary motivations for starting a walking program, identification of which elements were useful in optimising adherence to the program, and identification of the barriers to and facilitators of engagement with the program. Audio recordings were transcribed and thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified. Theme one identified that strong motivators to start a walking program were anticipated improvements in low back pain management and the added general health benefits of a more active lifestyle. Theme two identified that fear of high-impact exercises led to avoidance; however, walking was considered a safe exercise option. Theme three identified accountability, enjoyment of exercise and health benefits were critical to adherence. CONCLUSION: Participants recently recovered from low back pain reflected positively on a physiotherapist-prescribed walking program. Participants described what elements of the program were crucial to starting exercise and optimising adherence. These findings have informed a list of practical recommendations for physiotherapists to improve patient commencement and adherence to exercise.",0
Intimate Partner Violence.,"IPV is a widespread and destructive public health problem that impacts women across the world and the lifespan. IPV encompasses a wide range of negative behaviors towards a person's romantic partner which include physical aggression, sexual violence, stalking, psychological torment, and coercive behaviors. Persons who experience IPV face a wide range of debilitating physical, mental health, and financial outcomes compared to those who have never experienced violence. Physicians play an important role in caring for patients who have experienced violence; knowledge of IPV's impact, consequences, treatment, and patient preferences around IPV discussions can lead to improved patient satisfaction and outcomes.",0
Clinical Inertia Among Outpatients WithÂ HeartÂ Failure: Application of Treatment Nonintensification Taxonomy toÂ EPIC-HF Trial.,"BACKGROUND: The contribution of clinical inertia to suboptimal guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study examined reasons for GDMT nonintensification and characterized clinical inertia. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of EPIC-HF (Electronically Delivered, Patient-Activation Tool for Intensification of Medications for Chronic HeartÂ Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction), a randomized clinical trial evaluating a patient-activation tool on GDMT utilization, we performed a sequential, explanatory mixed-methods study. Reasons for nonintensification among 4 medication classes were assigned according to an expanded published taxonomy using structured chart reviews. Audio transcripts of clinic encounters were analyzed to further characterize nonintensification reasons. Integration occurred during the interpretation phase. RESULTS: Among 292 HFrEF patients who completed a cardiology visit, 185 (63.4%) experienced no treatment intensification, of whom 90 (48.6%) had at least 1 opportunity for intensification of a medication class with no documented contraindication or barriers (ie, clinical inertia). Nonintensification reasons varied by medication class, and included heightened risk of adverse effects (range 18.2%-31.6%), patient nonadherence (range 0.8%-1.1%), patient preferences and beliefs (range 0.6%-0.9%), comanagement with other providers (range 4.6%-5.6%), prioritization of other issues (range 15.6%-31.8%), multiple categories (range 16.5%-22.7%), and clinical inertia (range 22.7%-31.6%). A qualitative analysis of 32 clinic audio recordings demonstrated common characteristics ofÂ clinical inertia: 1) clinician review of medication regimens without education or intensification discussions; 2)Â patientÂ stability as justification for nonintensification; and 3) shorter encounters for nonintensification vs intensification. CONCLUSIONS: In this comprehensive study exploring HFrEF prescribing, clinical inertia is a main contributor to nonintensification within an updated taxonomy classification for suboptimal GDMT prescribing. This approach should help target strategies overcoming GDMT underuse.",0
Reproductive Planning: Contraceptive Counseling and Nonhormonal Methods.,"More than 65% of US women ages 15 to 49 years use contraception every year, many of whom seek care with family medicine. Family physicians are well equipped to provide comprehensive contraceptive counseling to patients in the primary care setting. When discussing options and providing education to patients, clinicians should consider patient preferences, patient autonomy, and adverse effect concerns, and should use a patient-centered approach that upholds the principles of reproductive justice. Nonhormonal methods of contraception include barrier methods and spermicides, fertility awareness-based methods, and (in postpartum individuals) lactational amenorrhea. With barrier methods, spermicides, and fertility awareness-based methods, 13 to 29 out of 100 women may become pregnant. Permanent forms of contraception include female and male sterilization procedures, which are some of the most effective (more than 99% effective) and most commonly used methods in the United States.",0
Preferences for risks and benefits of treatment outcomes for chronic low back pain: Choice-based conjoint measure development and discrete choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Understanding individual patient preferences for chronic low back pain (cLBP) outcomes is essential for targeting available therapeutic options; yet tools to elicit patient outcome preferences are limited. OBJECTIVE: To develop and test a choice-based conjoint (CBC) measure, commonly used in behavioral economics research, to elicit what outcomes patients with cLBP want to achieve and avoid. DESIGN: We developed a survey-based CBC measure to allow patients to make risk/benefit trade-off choices between possible treatment outcomes. After extensive literature, clinician, and patient input, our measure included seven attributes: fatigue, anxiety/depression, difficulty thinking/making decisions, pain intensity, physical abilities, change in pain, and ability to enjoy life despite pain. Random-parameters logit models were used to estimate strength of preferences, and latent class analysis was used to identify patient characteristics associated with distinct preference. SETTING: Online study using the Sawtooth web-based platform. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eleven individuals with cLBP recruited from online advertising as well as at clinical sites across multiple academic and private institutions. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. RESULTS: The most valued outcome was the highest level of physical activity (Î²â=â1.6-1.98; pâ<â.001), followed by avoiding cognitive difficulties (Î²â=â-1.48; pâ<â.001). Avoidance of severe pain was comparable to avoiding constant fatigue and near-constant depression/anxiety (Î²â=â-0.99, -1.02); pâ<â.001). There was an association between preferences and current pain/disability status; patients with higher pain had a stronger preference to avoid severe pain, whereas those with higher disability have stronger preferences for achieving physical activity. The latent class analysis identified two distinct groups: (1) more risk-seeking and willing to accept worse outcomes (56%); and (2) more risk-averse with a stronger preference for achieving maximum benefits (44%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study illuminated cLBP patient preferences for treatment outcomes and heterogeneity in these preferences. Patients stressed the importance of reaching high physical activity and avoiding cognitive declines, even over a desire to avoid pain. More work is needed to understand patient preferences to aid informed, shared decisions.",1
Parent's preferences for unscheduled paediatric healthcare: A discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Unscheduled healthcare is a key component of healthcare delivery and makes up a significant proportion of healthcare access, with children being particularly high users of unscheduled healthcare. Understanding the relative importance of factors that influence this behaviour and decision-making is fundamental to ensuring the system is best designed to meet the needs of users and foster appropriate cost-effective usage of health system resources. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify the parent's preferences for unscheduled healthcare for a common mild childhood illness. DESIGN: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was developed to identify the preferences of parents accessing unscheduled healthcare for their children. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from parents in Ireland (Nâ=â458) to elicit preferences across five attributes: timeliness, appointment type, healthcare professional attended, telephone guidance before attending and cost. RESULTS: Using a random parameters logit model, all attributes were statistically significant, cost (Î²â=â-5.064, 95% confidence interval, CI [-5.60, -4.53]), same-day (Î²â=â1.386, 95% CI [1.19, 1.58]) or next-day access (Î²â=â0.857, 95% CI [0.73, 0.98]), coupled with care by their own general practitioner (Î²â=â0.748, 95% CI [0.61, 0.89]), identified as the strongest preferences of parents accessing unscheduled healthcare for their children. DISCUSSION: The results have implications for policy development and implementation initiatives that seek to improve unscheduled health services as understanding how parents use these services can maximise their effectiveness. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The development of the DCE included a qualitative research component to ensure that the content accurately reflected parents experiences when seeking healthcare. Before data collection, a pilot test was carried out with the target population to gather their views on the survey.",1
Use of LetibotulinumtoxinA for Aesthetic Treatment of Asians: A Consensus.,"Treatment of wrinkles and dynamic lines with botulinum toxin has been a routine practice for years in aesthetic clinical settings. The effective treatment of wrinkles requires a comprehensive understanding of facial expression muscles and their interactions, the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin, and individual patient preferences. The dose adjustment practice and injection technique of physicians are affected by cultural differences; most Asian patients prefer natural-looking results. This article aims to present an expert consensus on the injection sites, doses, and levels of botulinum toxin for various indications in Asians, with the hope of providing guidance to some clinicians. This consensus paper reviews LetibotulinumtoxinA for patient evaluation, dosage, and delivery techniques in Asians from the time LetibotulinumtoxinA was approved up to December 2022. Panelists proposed individualized treatment plans for botulinum toxin type A (BTxA) treatments in 3 areas-wrinkle removal, contour adjustment, and face lifting-for Asians based on their extensive experience and knowledge of facial anatomy. When using a different BTxA, clinicians should start with a conservative dose and carefully individualize the treatment for each patient, and adjust it according to feedback to obtain a higher satisfaction level.",0
Patient's Perspective on Psychiatric Drugs: A Multicenter Survey-Based Study.,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the expectations and preferences for medication and medical decision-making in patients with major psychiatric disorders. METHODS: A survey was conducted among patients with major psychiatric disorders who visited psychiatric outpatient clinics at 15 hospitals between 2016 and 2018 in Korea. The survey consisted of 12 questions about demographic variables and opinions on their expectations for medication, important medical decision-makers, and preferred drug type. The most preferred value in each category in the total population was identified, and differences in the preference ratio of each item among the disease groups were compared. RESULTS: A total of 707 participants were surveyed. In the total population, patients reported high efficacy (44.01%Â±21.44%) as the main wish for medication, themselves (37.39%Â±22.57%) and a doctor (35.27%Â±22.88%) as the main decision makers, and tablet/capsule (36.16%Â±30.69%) as the preferred type of drug. In the depressive disorders group, the preference ratio of high efficacy was significantly lower, and the preference ratio of a small amount was significantly higher than that of the psychotic disorder and bipolar disorder groups. The preference ratio of a doctor as an important decision maker in the bipolar disorder group was higher compared to the other groups. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the preference for medications and showed differences among patients with psychiatric disorders. Providing personalized medicine that considers a patient's preference for the drug may contribute to the improvement of drug compliance and outcomes.",0
Effectiveness of patient decision aid supported shared decision-making intervention in in-person and virtual hybrid pulmonary rehabilitation in older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A pilot randomized controlled trial.,"INTRODUCTION: Tele-pulmonary rehabilitation is increasingly advocated but cannot completely substitute for in-person services for chronic conditions. Adherence to Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) remains low in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Shared decision-making (SDM) promotes patients' participation in PR decisions and helps patients and healthcare providers to jointly make decisions that patients are informed and aligned with patient preferences and values, which are critical for patient adherence to PR. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a hybrid in-person and virtual model of home-based PR services for older COPD patients and study the effectiveness of the patient decision aid (PDA)-supported recurring SDM intervention on patient adherence to PR, rehabilitation outcomes, and decision-related outcomes, as well as to explore the mechanisms of the intervention on PR adherence. METHODS: A total of 78 older COPD patients were randomly assigned to the PR group (nâ=â39) or PDA-PR group (nâ=â39). Both groups were conducted hybrid in-person and virtual PR intervention for 3 months. The primary outcomes were patients' quality of life and PR adherence. The secondary outcomes were dyspnea symptoms, exercise self-efficacy, knowledge, and decision-related outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 72 participants completed the 3-month PR program. There were statistically significant differences in PR adherence (pâ=â0.033), COPD assessment test (CAT) scores (pâ=â0.016), PR knowledge (pâ<â0.001), decision self-efficacy (pâ<â0.001), decision conflict (pâ<â0.001), and decision regret scores (pâ=â0.027) between the two groups. The modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea scale (mMRC) score was significantly decreased only in PDA-PR group (pâ=â0.011). No statistically significant differences were observed in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score (pâ=â0.078), Exercise Self-Regulatory Efficacy Scale (Ex-SRES) score (pâ=â0.29) and COPD knowledge (pâ=â0.086) between the two groups. PR value score had a significant effect on adherence to PR (pâ=â0.007) and CAT score (pâ=â0.028). CONCLUSIONS: PDA supported recurring SDM intervention was helpful in maintaining older COPD patients' PR adherence and had advantages in improving quality of life, enhancing PR knowledge, decision self-efficacy, and reducing decision conflict and decision regret, but did not improve SGRQ and Ex-SRES. PR value score influenced patients' rehabilitation adherence and quality of life.

Experiences of people with multiple sclerosis and clinicians in using cognitive behavioural therapies for hidden symptoms: a systematic review and meta-aggregation.,"PURPOSE: Cognitive behavioural therapies (CBTs) are a standard of care for treatment of many 'hidden symptoms' in people with MS (PwMS), such as stress, depression, and fatigue. However, these interventions can vary widely in formatting and may not be tailored for PwMS. To optimize CBTs for MS, understanding the experiences of PwMS and clinicians is essential. This systematic review and meta-aggregation synthesizes existing qualitative data on stakeholder perspectives of CBTs for PwMS. METHODS: Systematic searches across five major electronic databases were conducted. Studies reporting qualitative data were identified. Two reviewers performed screening, quality assessment, data extraction, and certainty of evidence assessments. Meta-aggregation was performed as per the Joanna Briggs Institute approach, entailing qualitative data extraction, developing categories, and synthesizing overall findings. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included in this review, comprising data from 653 PwMS and 47 clinicians. In the meta-aggregation, 122 qualitative results were extracted and grouped into nine categories. Categories were then combined into six synthesized findings: (1) setting the context-life with MS, (2) reasons for participating in CBTs, (3) acceptability of and experiences with participating in CBTs, (4) perceived benefits of CBTs, (5) perceived challenges with CBTs, and (6) suggestions to improve CBTs for PwMS. CONCLUSIONS: A range of benefits including psychological, social, and lifestyle improvements were reported, but varied based on the design of the CBT intervention. Future CBT interventions should be tailored to participant needs, delivered in group settings, offer online options, and be delivered by a trained facilitator familiar with MS. Further exploration of the ideal CBT design for PwMS, as well as engagement with caregivers and clinicians treating MS, is warranted.",0
Preferences of patients with chronic low back pain about nonsurgical treatments: Results of a discrete choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to assess patients' preferences of nonsurgical treatments for chronic low back pain (CLBP). METHOD: We conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) in Quebec, Canada, in 2018. Seven attributes were included: treatment modality, pain reduction, the onset of treatment efficacy, duration effectiveness, difficulties with daily activities, sleep problems,Â and knowledge of the patient'sÂ body and pain location. Treatment modalities were corticosteroid injections, supervised body-mind physical activities, supervised sports physical activities, physical manipulations, self-management courses,Â and psychotherapy. Utility levels were estimated using a logit model, a latent class modelÂ and a Bayesian hierarchical model. RESULTS: Analyses were conducted on 424 individuals. According to the Bayesian hierarchical model, the conditional relative importance weights of attributes were as follows: (1)Â treatment modality (34.79%), (2) pain reduction (18.73%), (3) difficulties with daily activities (11.71%), (4) duration effectiveness (10.06%), (5) sleep problems (10.05%), (6) onset of treatment efficacy (8.60%)Â and (7) knowledge of the patient's body and pain location (6.06%). According to the latent class model that found six classes of respondents with different behaviours (using Akaike and Bayesian criteria), the treatment modality was the most important attribute for all classes, except for class 4 for which pain reduction was the most important. In addition, classes 2 and 5 refused corticosteroid injections, while psychotherapy was preferred only in class 3. CONCLUSION: Given the preference heterogeneity found in the analysis, it is important that patient preferences are discussed and considered by the physicians. This will help to improve the patient care pathway in a context of a patient-centred model for a disease with growing prevalence. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: A small group of patients was involved in the conception, designÂ and interpretation of data. Participants in the DCEÂ were all CLBP patients.",1
"From a Patient Choice Perspective: Nearly 20 Years on, Has Patient Choice Improved or Was I Just Lucky?","With Watch & Wait becoming a more recognised approach to the treatment of early-stage lower rectal cancers I wanted to look at what has changed in nearly 20 years from a patient's perspective. In 2003 I was diagnosed with a T3a tumour and offer radical surgery but found Papillon and was lucky that it worked and I'm still here. Since then, things have improved but I still have patients contacting me saying they are being given no options - so I pose the question: From a Patient Choice Perspective: Nearly 20 Years on, Has Patient Choice Improved or Was I Just Lucky?",0
Pancreatitis sepsis: Evolution and principles in the management of necrotizing pancreatitis.,"Outcomes from some recent clinical trials have helped to improve the management of necrotizing pancreatitis over the last 2 decades. The location of the retroperitoneal collection, previous gastric surgery, patient preference, and medical expertise dictates a minimally invasive surgical step-up versus endoscopic approach. Endoscopic drainage is facilitated by either a plastic or metallic stent. Direct endoscopic necrosectomy is performed for lack of improvement after endoscopic drainage. The surgical approach is accomplished by minimally invasive surgery with either video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement or laparoscopic drainage. A multidisciplinary team with appropriate expertise should care for patients with necrotizing pancreatitis. This brief review summarizes the landmark clinical trials, compares the benefits and roles of endoscopic, surgical, and percutaneous interventions, and discusses treatment algorithms for necrotizing pancreatitis in the modern era.",0
Is Nonoperative Management of Rectal Cancer Feasible?,"During the past decade, the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) has become more complex. Total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT) has increased the rates of both clinical and pathologic complete response, resulting in improved long-term oncological outcomes. The feasibility to implement nonoperative management (NOM) depends on solving current challenges such as how to correctly identify the best candidates for a NOM without compromising oncologic safety. NOM should be part of the treatment discussion of LARC, considering increasing rates of clinical complete response, potential quality of life gains, avoidance of surgical morbidity, and patient preferences.",0
Anticoagulant treatment of cancer-associated thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent and potentially fatal complication in patients with cancer. During the initial period after the thromboembolic event, a patient receiving anticoagulant treatment is exposed both to a risk of VTE recurrence and also to an elevated bleeding risk conferred by the treatment. For this reason, the choice of anticoagulant is critical. The choice should take into account patient-related factors (such as functional status, age, body mass index, platelet count and renal function), VTE-related factors (such as severity or site), cancer-related factors (such as activity and progression) and treatment-related factors (such as drug-drug interactions), which all potentially influence bleeding risk, and patient preference. These should be evaluated carefully for each patient during a multidisciplinary team meeting. For most patients, apixaban or a low molecular-weight heparin is the most appropriate initial choice for anticoagulant treatment. Such treatment should be offered to all patients with active cancer for at least six months. The patient and treatment should be re-evaluated regularly and anticoagulant treatment changed when necessary. Continued anticoagulant treatment beyond six months is justified if the cancer remains active or if the patient experienced recurrence of VTE in the first six months. In other cases, the interest of continued anticoagulant treatment may be considered on an individual patient basis in collaboration with oncologists.",0
Intentional replantation and dental autotransplantation of mandibular posterior teeth: Two case reports.,"BACKGROUND: Intentional replantation and dental autotransplantation are 2 similar techniques both involving atraumatic tooth extraction, visualization of the root, and replantation. They are considered as the last resort for unsalvageable teeth. The author aims to describe 2 mandibular posterior teeth with serious periapical lesions which are resolved by intentional replantation and dental autotransplantation, respectively. CASE SUMMARY: In case 1, a 45-year-old male patient received root canal treatment because of a cracked mandible right first molar with periapical lesions. An endodontic file was separated in the apical third of the mesiolingual root canal. After conventional canal filling of the other root canals, the molar was atraumatically extracted. The separated instrument was removed, the mesiolingual root received a retrograde filling and the molar was replanted. At the 3-month follow up, the patient was asymptomatic and the X-ray picture showed no detectable root resorption and ankylosis. In case 2, a 29-year-old woman reported discomfort during occlusal loading after a root canal treatment and a coronal restoration of the mandibular right first molar. Radiographs showed a low-density shadow in the mesial apical and in the root furcation area of the mandibular first molar so the patient was diagnosed as chronic periapical periodontitis. After the removal of the affected tooth, the extraction socket was thoroughly debrided and irrigated. The intact mandibular right third molar with similar dimensions was extracted by minimally invasive procedure and transplanted. The donor tooth was fixed by a fiber-splint for 1 month and a root canal treatment was performed 2 weeks after surgery. After 1 year, clinical and radiographical examination revealed functional and periodontal healing. CONCLUSIONS: These 2 reports present the successful management of intentional replantation and dental autotransplantation. Both procedures are recommended after nonsurgical endodontic treatment, especially when apical microsurgery is not an option, for example because of difficult accessibility or patient preference.",0
"Localization Techniques for Non-Palpable Breast Lesions: Current Status, Knowledge Gaps, and Rationale for the MELODY Study (EUBREAST-4/iBRA-NET, NCT 05559411).","BACKGROUND: Surgical excision of a non-palpable breast lesion requires a localization step. Among available techniques, wire-guided localization (WGL) is most commonly used. Other techniques (radioactive, magnetic, radar or radiofrequency-based, and intraoperative ultrasound) have been developed in the last two decades with the aim of improving outcomes and logistics. METHODS: We performed a systematic review on localization techniques for non-palpable breast cancer. RESULTS: For most techniques, oncological outcomes such as lesion identification and clear margin rate seem either comparable with or better than for WGL, but evidence is limited to small cohort studies for some of the devices. Intraoperative ultrasound is associated with significantly higher negative margin rates in meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Radioactive techniques were studied in several RCTs and are non-inferior to WGL. Smaller studies show higher patient preference towards wire-free localization, but little is known about surgeons' and radiologists' attitudes towards these techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Large studies with an additional focus on patient, surgeon, and radiologist preference are necessary. This review aims to present the rationale for the MELODY (NCT05559411) study and to enable standardization of outcome measures for future studies.",0
Racial/Ethnic Minority Identifying Family Physicians Are More Likely to Work in Solo Practices.,"While the overall proportion of family physicians who work in solo practices has been steadily declining, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian family physicians are more likely to work in these settings. Given their association with high levels of continuity and improved health outcomes, and given patient preference for racial concordance with their physicians, policy makers and payors should consider how to support family physicians in solo practice in the interest of promoting access to and quality of care for ethnic/racial minorities.",0
Patient-oriented educational Sports Medicine YouTube videos in Arabic have higher view counts in the Middle East and North Africa than their English versions.,"PURPOSE: The present study aims to assess the impact of the local language on the view count of patient-oriented educational Sports Medicine videos in an Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital in the Middle East and North Africa. METHODS: An observational study on English and Arabic versions of Aspetar's YouTube channel patient-oriented educational video series was conducted in February 2023, comparing the view count and viewer characteristics. Included videos were posted either simultaneously or in English version first, in both languages, and shared on the same media platforms. Collected data of interest included video title, view count in each language, age and sex of the viewers, location, and traffic source. RESULTS: Eleven videos of the patient-oriented educational video series were included in the present study. Except for one, the view count was significantly higher in the Arabic version of all 11 videos (minimum sevenfold, P = 0.03). Viewers were predominantly males (73.9%) and between 18 and 44 years old (81.1%). Eleven out of 19 countries of the Middle East and North Africa region [11] were among the viewers' top 20 countries. Traffic sources included YouTube search (45.9%), YouTube suggested videos (17%), external sources (14.4%), YouTube browse features (8.5%), and YouTube advertising (6%). CONCLUSION: Patient-oriented educational Sports Medicine videos in Arabic yield higher view counts than their English version in young adult viewers from 11 countries in the Middle East and Africa among the top 20. Content creation on languages with limited online representation could effectively reach the targeted population by breaking language barriers.",0
Patient Priorities Concerning Treatment Decisions for Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors Identified by Discrete Choice Experiments.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) have multiple treatment options. Ideally, treatment decisions are shared between physician and patient; however, previous studies suggest that oncologists and patients place different value on treatment attributes such as adverse event (AE) rates. High-quality information on NET patient treatment preferences may facilitate patient-centered decision making by helping clinicians understand patient priorities. METHODS: This study used 2 discrete choice experiments (DCE) to elicit preferences of NET patients regarding advanced midgut and pancreatic NET (pNET) treatments. The DCEs used the ""potentially all pairwise rankings of all possible alternatives"" (PAPRIKA) method. The primary objective was to determine relative utility rankings for treatment attributes, including progression-free survival (PFS), treatment modality, and AE rates. Ranking of attribute profiles matching specific treatments was also determined. Levels for treatment attributes were obtained from randomized clinical trial data of NET treatments. RESULTS: One hundred and 10 participants completed the midgut NET DCE, and 132 completed the pNET DCE. Longer PFS was the highest ranked treatment attribute in 64.5% of participants in the midgut NET DCE, and in 59% in the pNET DCE. Approximately, 40% of participants in both scenarios prioritized lower AE rates or less invasive treatment modalities over PFS. Ranking of treatment profiles in the midgut NET scenario identified 60.9% of participants favoring peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), and 30.0% somatostatin analogue dose escalation. CONCLUSION: NET patients have heterogeneous priorities when choosing between treatment options based on the results of 2 independent DCEs. These results highlight the importance of shared decision making for NET patients.",1
Emerging space for non-polyethene-glycol bowel preparations in inflammatory bowel disease-related colonoscopy: Veering toward better adherence and palatability.,"Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) require repeated endoscopic evaluations over time by colonoscopy to weigh disease activity but also for different and additional indications (e.g., evaluation of postoperative recurrence, colorectal cancer surveillance). Colonoscopy, however, requires adequate bowel preparation to be of quality. The latter is achieved as long as the patient takes a certain amount of product to have a number of bowel movements suitable to clean the colon and allow optimal visualization of the mucosa during endoscopy. However, significant guidelines recommend preparations for patients with IBD not excelling in palatability. This recommendation originates from the fact that most of the studies conducted on bowel preparations in patients with IBD have been done with isosmolar preparations based on polyethylene glycol (PEG), for which, therefore, more safety data exist. As a result, the low-volume non-PEG preparations (e.g., magnesium citrate plus picosulphate, oral sulphate solutions) have been set aside for the whole range of warnings to be heeded because of their hyperosmolarity. New studies, however, are emerging, leaning in overall for a paradigm shift in this matter. Indeed, such non-PEG preparations seem to show a particularly encouraging and engaging safety profile when considering their broad potential for tolerability and patient preference. Indeed, such evidence is insufficient to indicate such preparations in all patients with IBD but may pave the way for those with remission or well-controlled disease. This article summarizes the central studies conducted in IBD settings using non-PEG preparations by discussing their results.",0
[Vestibular Schwannoma: Factors in Therapy Decision-Making].,"The treatment of vestibular schwannomas (VS) has always posed a challenge for physicians. Three essential treatment principles are available: wait-and-scan, surgery, and stereotactic radiotherapy. In addition to the type of treatment, decisions must be made regarding the optimal timing of therapy, the combination of different treatment modalities, the potential surgical approach, and the type and intensity of radiation. Factors influencing the therapy decision include tumor location and size or stage, patient age, comorbidities, symptoms, postoperative hearing rehabilitation options, patient preferences, and, not least, the experience of the surgeons and the personnel and technical capabilities of the clinical site. This article begins with a brief overview of vestibular schwannomas, then outlines the fundamental interdisciplinary treatment options, and finally discusses the ENT (ear, nose, and throat)-relevant factors in the therapy decision.",0
Analysis of Barriers to Public and Private Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs in Patients with Low and High Adherence.,"INTRODUCTION: Participants in cardiac rehabilitation programs have low adherence to their sessions, which makes extremely important to recognize the barriers that cause non-adherence, identifying whether the type of service and level of adherence influence these barriers. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study, in which 220 individuals (66.80Â±11.59 years) of both genders who are members of public and private exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs participated. The volunteers were divided according to the level of adherence, considering patients with low adherence (PLA) those with < 70% of attendance and high adherence (PHA) those with > 70%. Then, initial evaluation, Cardiac Rehabilitation Barriers Scale, analysis of socioeconomic level, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Mini-Mental State Examination were applied. RESULTS: Higher total barriers were found in PLA in the public service compared to PHA in the private service (P=0.023). In the subscale ""perceived need"", PHA in the public service showed higher values than PLA and PHA in the private service (Pâ¤0.001). The ""access"" barrier was higher for PHA in the public service when compared to PHA in the private service (P=0.024). PHA in the public service exhibited a higher barrier regarding questions about distance, transportation problems, cost, and time constraints. CONCLUSION: The public program presents higher barriers in the questions and categories compared to the private program, mainly the PHA. Furthermore, there are differences in the profile of the participants regarding socioeconomic and anxiety levels, treatment time, ethnicity, and city where they live.",0
Multidisciplinary consensus document on the current treatment of bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder tumor.,"Radical cystectomy is the current treatment of choice for patients with BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder tumor (NMIBC). However, the high comorbidity of this surgery and its effects on the quality of life of patients require the investigation and implementation of bladder-sparing treatment options. These must be evaluated individually by the uro-oncology committee based on the characteristics of the BCG failure, type of tumor, patient preferences and treatment options available in each center. Based on FDA-required oncologic outcomes (6-month complete response rate for CIS: 50%; duration of response in responders for CIS and papillary: 30% at 12 months and 25% at 18 months), there is not currently a strong preference for one treatment over another, although the intravesical route seems to offer less toxicity. This work summarizes the evidence on the management of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC based on current scientific evidence and provides consensus recommendations on the most appropriate treatment.",0
"Birth plans: definitions, content, effects, and best practices.","The first written guide for birth plans was introduced in 1980 as a means for birthing people to document their choices in the child birthing experience. The birth plan offers an opportunity for the patient and the provider to discuss the birthing process and determine how to safely accommodate patient preferences. Patient satisfaction with birthing plans is variable and may depend on how many requests they have, how many of their plans are accomplished, route of delivery, and whether complications arise during or after delivery. Unmet expectations may lead to posttraumatic stress disorder, but following a birth plan may also be protective against it. Birthing people who use a birth plan may be less likely to use epidural anesthesia, have early amniotomy, or use oxytocin. The first stage of labor may be longer when a birth plan is used; however, there does not seem to be a decrease in the length of the second stage of labor among patients with a birth plan. Some providers believe that a disadvantage of birth plans is disappointment when birth plans are not able to be followed, and others consider that birth plans interfere with professional autonomy.",0
Preferences for Enhanced Primary Care Services Among Older Individuals and Primary Care Physicians.,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the factors that are most important for community-dwelling older individuals (i.e., users) and primary care (PC) providers to enhance PC services. METHODS: Discrete choice experiment surveys were administered to 747 individuals aged â¥ 60 years and 242 PC physicians in Singapore between December 2020 and August 2021. Participants were asked to choose between two hypothetical PC clinics and their current clinic. Latent class models were used to estimate the relative attribute importance (RAI) and to calculate the predicted uptake for enhanced PC services. RESULTS: Based on the attributes and levels used in this study, the out-of-pocket cost (RAI: 47%) and types of services offered (RAI: 25%) were the most important attributes for users while working hours (RAI: 28%) and patient load (RAI: 25%) were the most important for providers. For out-of-pocket visit costs ranging from Singapore dollars (S)$100 to S$5, users' predicted uptake for enhanced PC services ranged from 46 to 84%. For daily patient loads ranging from 60 to 20 patients, providers' predicted uptake ranged from 64 to 91%, assuming their income remains unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides timely insights for the development of strategies to support the government's new health care initiative (HealthierSG), which places PC at the center of Singapore's healthcare system. The ability to choose their preferred clinic, low out-of-pocket costs and types of services offered (for users), and reasonable working conditions (for providers) were the key factors for users and providers to participate in enhanced PC services.",1
Unilateral Hyperpigmented Facial Lesion Since Birth.,"Facial hyperpigmented lesions that are unilateral are a rare and challenging dermatological anomaly since birth which can be genetic and non-genetic. This paper seeks to provide an exhaustive overview of the etiology, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and management strategies for these congenital lesions. Unilateral facial hyperpigmented lesions can be caused by a number of conditions, such as congenital melanocytic nevi, Becker's nevus, nevus of Ota, linear epidermal nevi, and cafÃ©-au-lait macules. Accurate diagnosis requires meticulous examination, dermoscopy, and histopathological evaluation. Observation, topical therapies, surgical excision, and laser therapy are among the available treatment options. Treatment decisions should be influenced by factors such as lesion characteristics, aesthetic concerns, and patient preferences. Long-term supervision and psychosocial support are indispensable elements of comprehensive management. We present a case of a 12-year-old patient with a progressively growing hyperpigmented lesion on the right side of the face, present since birth with an intermittent area of normal skin in between. Dermoscopy unveiled an irregular, dark brown pigment network, and histopathological evaluation showed an increased number of melanocytes in the dermis. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of such lesions and underscores the significance of a multidisciplinary approach for accurate evaluation and management. This paper aims to cover existing knowledge gaps regarding unilateral facial hyperpigmented lesions since birth and direct future research efforts for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.",0
Evaluating Patient Preferences and Clinical Outcomes in Stress Urinary Incontinence Treatment: A Short-Term Follow-Up Study of the Transobturator Tape Procedure and Pubourethral Ligament Plication (a Minimally Invasive Technique).,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide an in-depth analysis of patient preferences and clinical outcomes associated with two surgical techniques for treating stress urinary incontinence (SUI): the transobturator suburethral sling (TOT) procedure and the pubourethral ligament plication (PUL) procedure. We evaluated the rates of postoperative complications, the duration of each procedure, hemoglobin loss, and days of hospitalization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 80 patients who underwent surgery for SUI: 40 patients for the TOT procedure and 40 patients for the PUL procedure. Clinical data on patient characteristics, treatment efficacy, and post-surgical outcomes were analyzed to assess patient preferences and real-world clinical effectiveness. RESULTS: Regarding patient preferences, those who underwent TOT surgery were more likely to be older, had a higher average number of pregnancies, and were more often postmenopausal, in contrast to those who underwent PUL surgery (p < 0.001 for each comparison). TOT patients had a hospital stay on average of 1.02 days, while PUL patients benefited from ambulatory stays only. In addition, the TOT group had a significantly longer average operating time (16.80 min) compared to the PUL group (9.90 min, p < 0.001). The study revealed notable outcomes in both groups, with high cure rates for both TOT (N(1) = 33, 82.5%) and PUL (N(2) = 28, 70%) procedures. Specifically, 76.25% of the patients (61 out of 80) were cured after the procedures. Chronic pelvic pain was present in 3.75% of all patients and was notably only observed in the TOT group, with 3 (7.5%) cases being noted. Similarly, vaginal erosion was experienced by 5% of all patients, with 10% of patients in the TOT group and none in the PUL group being affected. Dyspareunia occurred in 2.5% of all patients, with there being two (5%) cases in the TOT group and none in the PUL group. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that while the PUL procedure achieves cure rates comparable to TOT, it offers a less invasive option with shorter operating times and no hospitalization required. These findings suggest that PUL could be a viable alternative for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) treatment, especially in contexts where avoiding mesh use is preferred. This adds significant value to patient-centered care in SUI management, offering tailored treatment options based on patient characteristics, preferences, and risk profiles.",0
Efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis: update for the practising clinician.,"Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, including tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib and filgotinib, are increasingly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There has been debate about their safety, particularly following the issuance of guidance by regulatory agencies advising caution in their use in certain patients. The registrational clinical trials and registry data of JAK inhibitors did not identify a difference in theÂ risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), venous thromboembolism, malignancies or infections (other than herpes zoster) with a JAK inhibitor versus aÂ biologicÂ DMARD. In the ORAL Surveillance trial, which enrolled patients >50 yearsÂ of age with â¥1 cardiovascular risk factor, tofacitinib was statistically inferior to TNF inhibitors for the occurrence of MACEs and malignancy. Further post hoc analysis of the data revealed that anÂ ageÂ of â¥65 years, aÂ high baseline cardiovascular risk, aÂ history of smoking, sustained inflammation, disease activity and suboptimal treatment of cardiovascular comorbidities all increase the risk of these outcomes. The guidance issued by regulatory agencies should be carefully considered to ensure appropriate and safe treatment of patients with RA without undertreatment of patients who might benefit from JAK inhibitor, as well as biologic, treatment. As always, the risks associated with the use of these agents, treatment goals, costs and patient preferences should be discussed with the patient.",0
Exploring patient treatment decision making for osteoarthritis in the UAE: a cross-sectional adaptive choice-based conjoint study.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess osteoarthritis (OA) patients' preferences for pharmaceutical treatment via Adaptive Choice-Based Conjoint (ACBC) method. METHODS: A United Arab Emirates (UAE) based Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) group designed the ACBC questionnaire with 10 attributes and 34 levels. The questionnaire was developed using Sawtooth Software and analyzed through Hierarchical Bayesian (HB). Results were standardized using Z-score via SPSS. RESULTS: Study participants were 1030 OA patients, 83.6% aged 50 or older and 83.4% female. The avoidance of medication's side effects accounted for 66% relative importance compared to 6% relative importance for the medication's benefits. The ""way of taking the medicine"" attribute had the highest coefficient of variation (70%) and the four side effect attributes ""risk of gastric ulcer, addiction, kidney and liver impairment, and heart attacks and strokes"" had a coefficient of variation from 18 to 21%. CONCLUSIONS: Arab OA patients are similar to other ethnic groups in trading-off benefits and side effects and consistently prioritizing the avoidance of medications' side effects. Although the ""Way of taking medicine"" was the least important attribute it was associated with the highest variation amongst patients. OA patients also prefer prescribed medications to internet-purchased and over-the-counter options.",1
Patient Comfort with Before and After Photography at Plastic Surgery Offices.,"BACKGROUND: Before and after (B&A) photographs are a sensitive part of patients' medical records, and the use of smartphones may pose risks to confidentiality and comfort. The purpose of this study was to assess patient comfort depending on the circumstances under which these photographs being taken. METHODS: Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service and REDCap's survey manager were used to recruit survey participants. An anonymous survey was distributed to ascertain demographics and comfort in various B&A scenarios using a five-point Likert scale. T tests and ANOVA testing were used to compare groups. RESULTS: There were 411 respondents with an average age of 36.1 years old. Of them, 46% were female and the majority were White (90%) and non-Hispanic (64%). Nearly one-third had previously undergone plastic surgery, with 80% receiving B&A photography. Surgeons took these photographs 51% of the time with similar rates of smartphone cameras use (47%) versus professional cameras (52%). The public had similar levels of comfort when a nurse or a surgeon took the clinical photographs (pÂ =Â 0.08). Patients were significantly less comfortable when non-medically trained office staff captured their photographs (pÂ =Â 0.0041). The public had similar comfort levels with the use of smartphones and professional cameras when dressed but were significantly less comfortable with the use of a smartphone when unclothed (pÂ =Â <Â 0.001). CONCLUSION: To ensure the best patient experience, B&A photography should be taken by a medical professional. If photographs are to be taken when the patient is unclothed, the use of a professional-grade camera may help ease patient discomfort.

Demystifying Dry Powder Inhaler Resistance with Relevance to Optimal Patient Care.,"The selection of an inhaler device is a key component of respiratory disease management. However, there is a lack of clarity surrounding inhaler resistance and how it impacts inhaler selection. The most common inhaler types are dry powder inhalers (DPIs) that have internal resistance and pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) that use propellants to deliver the drug dose to the airways. Inhaler resistance varies across the DPIs available on the market, depending largely on the design geometry of the device but also partially on formulation parameters. Factors influencing inhaler choice include measures such as flow rate or pressure drop as well as inhaler technique and patient preference, both of which can lead to improved adherence and outcomes. For optimal disease outcomes, device selection should be individualised, inhaler technique optimised and patient preference considered. By addressing the common clinically relevant questions, this paper aims to demystify how DPI resistance should guide the selection of the right device for the right patient.",0
"Comparing Tubeless and Tubed Approaches in Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy for Moderate Renal Calculi: Outcomes on Safety, Efficacy, Pain Management, Recovery Time, and Cost-Effectiveness.","Introduction This study focuses on investigating the effect of routine nephrostomy tube placement in patients with moderate renal calculi of size 2.5 cm or less who undergo uncomplicated percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) procedures. Previous studies have not specified whether only uncomplicated cases were included in the analysis, which may affect the results. This study aims to provide a clearer understanding of the effect of routine nephrostomy tube placement on blood loss in a more homogeneous patient population. Materials and methods A prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted at our department over 18 months, dividing 60 patients with a single renal or upper ureteric calculus of size â¤2.5 cm into two groups: 30 patients in each group (group 1: tubed PCNL, group 2: tubeless PCNL). The primary outcome was the drop in perioperative hemoglobin levelÂ and the number of packed cell transfusions necessary. The secondary outcome included the mean pain score, analgesic requirement, length of hospital stay, time to return to normal activities, and the total cost of the procedure. Results The two groups were comparable in age, gender, comorbidities, and stone size. The postoperative hemoglobin level was significantly lower in the tubeless PCNL group (9.56 Â± 2.13 gm/dL) compared to the tube PCNL group (11.32 Â± 2.35 gm/dL) (p = 0.0037), and two patients in the tubeless group required blood transfusion. The duration of surgery, pain scores, and analgesic requirement were comparable between the two groups. The total procedure cost was significantly lower in the tubeless group (p = 0.0019), and the duration of hospital stay and time to return to daily activities were significantly shorter in the tubeless group (p < 0.0001). Conclusions Tubeless PCNL is a safe and effective alternative to conventional tube PCNL, with the advantages of shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, and lower procedure costs. Tube PCNL is associated with less blood loss and the need for transfusions. Patient preferences and bleeding risk should be considered when choosing between the two procedures.",0
A rapid umbrella review of the literature surrounding the provision of patient-centred end-of-life care.,"BACKGROUND: Patients have reported a broad range of unmet needs in their receipt of clinical care at the end of life. Therefore, enhancing the quality of end-of-life care through patient-centred healthcare interactions is warranted. AIM: The aim of this rapid umbrella review was to synthesise previous literature reviews that have examined: (1) patient preferences for patient-centred end-of-life care; (2) barriers and enablers to patient-centred end-of-life care; (3) interventions designed to enhance patient-centred end-of-life care; and (4) patient-centred models of end-of-life care. DESIGN: A rapid umbrella review was conducted and informed by the Joanna Briggs Institute's methodological guidance for conducting umbrella reviews. DATA SOURCES: Three academic databases were searched for relevant literature in May 2022: MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL Plus. Inclusion criteria encompassed literature reviews that examined the topic of patient-centred care for any adult patients in end-of-life care. RESULTS: A total of 92 literature reviews were identified. Findings suggest that there is often a discrepancy between patient preferences and the provision of care. These discrepancies have been associated with a range of barriers at the patient, staff and system levels. Common interventions included education and training for staff which were often met with improved patient outcomes. Patient-centred models of care were underrepresented across the literature. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlighted a need for healthcare systems to support staff in providing a patient-centred end of life experience through the development of a co-designed patient-centred model of care, supplemented by professional development and a systematic approach to identifying and documenting patient preferences.",0
"A Head-to-Head Comparison of Computed Tomography Colonography, Optical Colonoscopy, and Colon Endoscopic Capsule for the Detection of Polyps After Partial Colectomy or Rectosigmoidectomy for Colorectal Cancer: A Pilot Study.","Background and objective Optical colonoscopy is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) and it allows for biopsy and resection, as well as documentation of synchronous lesions. CT colonography (CTC) and colon endoscopic capsule (CEC) are also recommended as alternative minimally invasive or non-invasive procedures. Prospective studies comparing these three approaches are scarce in the current literature. In light of this, the aim of this pilot study was to compare the efficacy of polyp detection between these three methods in patients with a history of curative surgical resection of CRC. Methods Patients were consecutively recruited and all procedures were sequentially conducted on the same day. The primary endpoint was the detection rate of polyps, whereas secondary endpoints were the detection of polyps according to size and location, and theÂ adverse events caused by these procedures. Results A total of 21 patients were consecutively included and all of them underwent all three interventions.Â No adverse events, local recurrences, or metachronous lesions were detected. In two cases with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CTC unveiled distant metastasis. Optical colonoscopy registered a mean of 0.4 polyp >6 mm and 1.3 polyps <6 mm per patient. CTC unveiled only 0.5 polyp >6 mm/patient and no smaller lesions were documented, whereas findings for the colon capsule comprised an average of 0.4 polyps >6 mm and 0.7 polyps <6 mm per patient. Statistical difference was not demonstrated, except for virtual colonoscopy in terms of the total number of polyps detected in comparison to optical colonoscopy. Conclusions Optical colonoscopy showed superior results in comparison to virtual colonoscopy while there was no statistical difference in comparison to colon capsule. Notwithstanding occasional difficulties, all three techniques were well tolerated. Hence, decisions concerning the use of each diagnostic method shouldÂ be based on their availability, professional expertise, contraindications, and patient preferences.",0
What do patients want to know about surgery for low-risk thyroid cancer? A qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making about treatment for low-risk thyroid cancer requires patients and surgeons to work together to select treatment that best balances risks and expected outcomes with patient preferences and values. To participate, patients must be activated and ask questions. We aimed to characterize what topics patients prioritize during treatment decision-making. METHODS: We identified substantive questions by patients with low-risk (cT1-2, N0) thyroid cancer during audio-recorded consultations with 9 surgeons at 2 unique health care systems. Logistics questions were excluded. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify major themes among patients' questions and surgeon responses. RESULTS: Overall, 28 of 30 patients asked 253 substantive questions, with 2 patients not asking any substantive questions (median 8, range 0-25). Patients were 20 to 71 years old, mostly White (86.7%) and female (80.0%). The questions addressed extent of surgery, hormone supplementation, risk of cancer progression, radioactive iodine, and etiology of thyroid cancer. When patients probed for a recommendation regarding extent of surgery, surgeons often responded indirectly. When patients asked how surgery could impact quality of life, surgeons focused on oncologic benefits and surgical risk. Patients commonly asked about hormone supplementation and radioactive iodine. CONCLUSION: Patient questions focused on the decision regarding extent of surgery, quality of life, and nonsurgical aspects of thyroid cancer care. Surgeon responses do not consistently directly answer patients' questions but focus on the risks, benefits, and conduct of surgery itself. These findings suggest an opportunity to help surgeons with resources to improve shared decision-making by providing information that patients prioritize.",0
DutchÂ prostate cancer patients' views about exercise and experience with exercise advice: a national survey.,"PURPOSE: To support the development and implementation of exercise programming for people with prostate cancer (PC), we investigated their views on exercise. METHODS: Online survey with open recruitment. We collected data on clinical and sociodemographic variables, experiences with exercise advice, outcome expectations, and preferences. We explored determinants of (1) having been counselled about exercise and (2) preferring supervised exercise. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 171 patients (mean age = 70 years, SD = 6.5) from all PC treatment pathways. Sixty-three percent of the respondents reported never having been informed about the potential benefits of exercise. Forty-nine percent preferred exercise to be supervised. Respondents generally reported a positive attitude towards exercise. Seventy-four percent indicated barriers to exercising, including fatigue and lack of access to specific programmes. Outcome expectations were generally positive but moderately strong. Receiving hormonal therapy and younger age were significantly associated with having received exercise advice. Being insured and having higher fatigue levels contributed significantly to the preference for supervised exercise. CONCLUSION: Dutch people with PC reportÂ receiving insufficient effective exercise counselling. Yet, they are open to exercise and expect exercise to improve their health, although they experience various barriers that limit their ability to exercise. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: The moderate outcome expectations for exercise of people with PC and their limited recall of exercise counselling highlight the need for better integration of exercise in clinical pathways. The lack of access to specific programming limits the use of evidence-based exercise programmes for people with PC.",0
"Factors associated to patients' referral to public or private Covid-19 healthcare centers in Tabriz, Iran.","BACKGROUND: In Iran, tracking of patients and its associated data recording in private healthcare centers are poor, and thus a majority of patients suffering from Covid-19 are treated without any control on the isolation and quarantine processes. The present study aims to investigate the factors contributed to referral to private or public healthcare centers that provide Covid-19 care services. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2021 to January 2022 in Tabriz, Iran. We invited a total of 258 and 202Covid-19 patients from governmental and private healthcare centers, respectively, to participate in the study by convenient sampling method. Applying a self-administered questionnaire, we collected data on the reason of referring to the healthcare centers, patient's waiting time, quality of healthcare services received by the patients, patients' level of satisfaction, accessibility, insurance coverage, perceived severity of the disease, and the level of staff compliance from health protocols. Logistic regression model was used for data analysis by using SPSS-26 software. RESULTS: Adjusted for other variables, higher socio-economic status (AOR (Adjusted Odds Ratio)â=â6.64), older age (AORâ=â1.02), referral of friends and family members (AORâ=â1.52), shorter waiting time (AORâ=â1.02) and higher satisfaction (AORâ=â1.02) were contributed to referral to private centers. Better accessibility (AORâ=â0.98) and wider insurance coverage (AORâ=â0.99) were also contributed to referral to governmental centers. CONCLUSION: Providing more appropriate insurance coverage by private healthcare centers, and promoting their level of accessibility seems to promote patients' referral to such centers. Moreover, establishing an accurate system for recording patients' information and follow up in private centers might promote the role of private healthcare centers in managing the overload of patients on healthcare system during such epidemics.",0
Patient preferences in the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain: a systematic review of discrete choice experiments.,"Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is a preference-sensitive condition for which numerous treatment options are available, each with benefits and risks. Thus, patient preferences play a critical role in decision making. This study summarized evidence from discrete choice experiments (DCEs) to quantify patient preferences for CMP treatment and identified important treatment attributes. A systematic review of DCEs on patient preferences for CMP treatment was conducted. Studies were included if they used DCE to determine patient preferences for CMP. A previously described methodological assessment tool was used to assess the risk of bias. The treatment attributes were summarized and sorted according to the frequency of citation and relative weight. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the intervention-specific attributes. A total of 15 eligible studies with 4065 participants were included. We identified ""capacity to realize daily life activities,"" ""risk of adverse events,"" ""effectiveness in pain reduction,"" and ""out-of-pocket cost"" as important attributes. Although ""treatment frequency"" and ""onset of treatment efficacy"" were less frequently mentioned, they were also important attributes. The attribute of ""risk of adverse events"" was especially important for drug treatment. The ""out-of-pocket cost"" and ""treatment location and mode"" were important attributes of exercise therapy. The attributes identified in this review will inform the design of future DCE studies, facilitate the translation of measurement-based care to value-based care, and provide the rationale to promote shared decision making and patient-centered care.",1
Approach to the Patient with Type 2 Diabetes Requiring Add-On Medication.,"In the last 20 years, the number of approved agents and agent classes for management of type 2 diabetes has expanded significantly. This more robust armamentarium affords us the opportunity to utilize drugs with complementary modes of action to address progressive hyperglycemia as insulin secretion declines over time. Furthermore, some of these agents provide additional benefits, such as weight loss, prevention of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), and protection against declining renal function. This dramatic increase of treatment options has led to complex published treatment advice which may be challenging for the busy clinician. A critical element in medication selection is awareness of the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) lowering potency of the agent being considered, and the distance of the patient's HbA1c from the individualized goal. Other important factors in choosing medication as diabetes progresses include the recognition that there is a diminishing return of glucose-lowering efficacy as add-on agents are introduced, and that the extent of benefit for cardiac and renal protection is not fully understood. In addition, the availability of newer non-insulin agents may distract the clinician from utilizing insulin, the most potent agent available. This goal of this article is to provide a straightforward approach to add-on medication in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, recognizing the limits of polypharmacy and the importance of employing agents best suited to achieving treatment targets. Proposed is a practical tool which provides stepwise guidance, utilizing available data on medication efficacy, while allowing flexibility based on clinician and patient preference.",0
PRO Hair Safe Study: The Patient's Perspective on the Effects of Scalp Cooling on Hair Preservation.,"PURPOSE: Alopecia has been reported a distressing side-effect of chemotherapy for breast cancer patients (BCP) that is highly relevant for quality of life during treatment. For the prevention of chemotherapy-induced alopecia, scalp cooling (SC) has been reported to be an effective and safe intervention. However, data on the patient's perspective on effectiveness and applicability of SC in a clinical routine setting are scarce. In this comparative study, we aimed at a longitudinal assessment of patient-reported outcome (PRO) data on the effect of SC on alopecia and its effect on symptoms and functional health when applied in clinical routine in BCP receiving taxane or anthracycline-based chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study participants were allocated either to the intervention group receiving SC or to the control group based on patient preference (non-randomized study). All patients completed PRO-measures on hair preservation (EORTC Item Library items on hair loss), symptom and functional health measures (EORTC QLQ-C30 and -BR23) and the Body Image Scale (BIS). Outcomes were assessed at chemotherapy start (baseline), mid-chemotherapy, last chemotherapy cycle, 3 months follow-up and 6-9 months follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, we included 113 patients: 75 patients underwent SC (mean age = 51.3 years, 52.7% premenopausal); 38 patients standard care (mean age = 55.6 years, 39.5% premenopausal). A total of 53 patients (70.7%) discontinued SC, with 39 patients (73.5%) stating alopecia as the primary reason. On average, BCP stayed on treatment with the cooling cap for 40.2% of the duration of their chemotherapy (SD 25.3%). In an intention-to-treat analysis, we found no difference between the SC group and the control group with regard to their patient-reported hair loss (p=0.831) across the observation period, overall QOL (p=0.627), emotional functioning (p=0.737), social functioning (p=0.635) and body image (p=0.463) did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: We found a high rate of SC-decliners and no beneficial effects of SC for patient-reported hair loss, symptoms and functional health. The efficacy and tolerability of SC applied in a clinical routine setting hence appeared to be limited. The further determination and up-front definition of criteria prognostic for effectiveness of SC may be helpful to identify patient subgroups that may experience a treatment benefit.",0
Understanding what matters to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients when considering treatment options: A US patient preference survey.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding how patients perceive the efficacy, safety, and administrative burden of treatments for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) can facilitate shared-decision making for optimal management. This study sought to elicit patient preferences for mCRPC treatments in the US. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using the discrete-choice experiment method. Participants were asked to state their choices over successive sets of treatment alternatives, defined by varying levels of treatment attributes: overall survival (OS), months until patients develop a fracture or bone metastasis, likelihood of requiring radiation to control bone pain, fatigue, nausea, and administration (i.e., oral/IV injection/IV infusion). Using mixed logit models, we determined the value (i.e., preference weights) that respondents placed on each attribute. Relative attribute importance (RAI) and marginal rates of substitution (MRS) were calculated to understand patients' willingness to make tradeoffs among different attributes. RESULTS: The final data set numbered 160 participants, with a mean age of 71.6âyears old and a mean of 8.96âyears since prostate cancer diagnosis. Participants' treatment preferences were as follows: OS (RAI: 31%), bone pain control (23%), nausea (16%), delaying fracture or bone metastasis (15%), fatigue (11%), and administration (3%). The MRS demonstrated that respondents were willing to trade 1.9Â months of OS to eliminate moderate nausea and 3.3Â months of OS for a reduction in fatigue from severe to mild. CONCLUSIONS: Improving OS is the highest priority for patients with mCRPC, but they are willing to trade some survival to reduce the risk of requiring radiation to control bone pain, delay a fracture or bone metastasis, and experience less severe nausea and fatigue.",1
The Effects of Changing Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Devices in Japanese Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Case Series.,"Objective The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in Japanese patients have not been reported. We assessed the effects of changing CPAP devices (from the Philips Respironics device to the ResMed device) on the control of OSA. Methods We retrospectively examined 13 patients with OSA who voluntarily changed from the Philips Respironics device to the ResMed device due to a Philips Respironics CPAP device recall. Data on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) were obtained from the CPAP devices for three months before and after changing the devices. Results The AHI obtained from the CPAP devices significantly decreased from 4.4 (3.1-10.7) events/h to 2.0 (0.8-3.6) events/h when patients changed devices (p=0.022). The AHI decreased to <5 events/h after changing devices in 4 patients, whereas it had been â¥5 events/h before changing devices in 6 patients. Conclusion Changing CPAP devices can decrease the AHI.",0
Patterns of Health Care Access and Use in an Urban American Indian and Alaska Native Population.,"Studies of health care access and use among historically resilient populations, while common, often field a limited sample size and rarely ask the groups most impacted by health inequities to weigh in. This is especially so for research and programs that focus on the American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) population. The present study addresses this gap by examining data from a cross-sectional survey of AIANs in Los Angeles County. To better interpret project findings and generate culturally relevant contexts, qualitative feedback was gathered at a community forum held in Spring 2018. Because recruitment of AIANs has historically been challenging, purposive sampling was employed to strategically identify a larger eligible pool. Among those who were eligible, 94% completed the survey (n = 496). AIANs who were enrolled in a tribe were 32% more likely to use the Indian Health Service (IHS), compared with those who were not enrolled (95% CI: 20.4%, 43.2%; p < .0001). In multivariable modeling, the strongest factors influencing IHS access and use were: tribal enrollment, preference for culturally-specific health care, proximity of the services to home or work, having Medicaid, and having less than a high school education. Feedback from the community forum indicated cost and trust (of a provider) were important considerations for most AIANs. Study findings reveal heterogeneous patterns of health care access and use in this population, suggesting a need to further improve the continuity, stability, and the image of AIANs' usual sources of care (e.g., IHS, community clinics).",0
"Patient preferences, regret, and health-related quality of life among older adults with acute myeloid leukemia: A pilot longitudinal study.","INTRODUCTION: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with poor outcomes and is generally incurable. Therefore, understanding preferences of older adults with AML is critical. We sought to assess whether best-worst scaling (BWS) can be used to capture attributes considered by older adults with AML when making initial treatment decisions and longitudinally, as well as assess changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and decisional regret over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a longitudinal study for adults â¥60Â years with newly diagnosed AML, we collected: (1) attributes of treatment most important to patients using BWS, (2) HRQoL using EQ-5D-5L, (3) decisional regret using the Decisional Regret Scale, and (4) treatment worthiness using the ""Was it worth it?"" questionnaire. Data was collected at baseline and over six months. A hierarchical Bayes model was used to allocate percentages out of 100%. Due to small sample size, hypothesis testing was performed at Î±Â =Â 0.10 (2-tailed). We analyzed how these measures differed by treatment choice (intensive vs. lower intensity treatment). RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 76Â years (nÂ =Â 15). At baseline, the most important attributes of treatment to patients were response to treatment (i.e., chance that the cancer will respond to treatment; 20.9%). Compared to those who received lower intensity treatment (nÂ =Â 7) or best supportive care (nÂ =Â 2), those who received intensive treatment (nÂ =Â 6) generally ranked ""alive one year or more after treatment"" (pÂ =Â 0.03) with higher importance and ranked ""daily activities"" (pÂ =Â 0.01) and ""location of treatment"" (pÂ =Â 0.01) with less importance. Overall, HRQoL scores were high. Decisional regret was mild overall and lower for patients who chose intensive treatment (pÂ =Â 0.06). DISCUSSION: We demonstrated that BWS can be used to assess the importance of various treatment attributes considered by older adults with AML when making initial treatment decisions and longitudinally throughout treatment. Attributes of treatment important to older patients with AML differed between treatment groups and changed over time. Interventions are needed to re-assess patient priorities throughout treatment to ensure care aligns with patient preferences.",1
Comparison of Selective Nerve Root Pulsed Radiofrequency Vs Paramedian Interlaminar Epidural Steroid Injection for the Treatment of Painful Cervical Radiculopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Although there are studies evaluating ultrasound-guided selective nerve root pulsed radiofrequency (ULSD-SNRPRF) and fluoroscopy-guided paramedian cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injection (FL-CIESI) for the treatment of chronic cervical radicular pain, no study has compared the efficacy of these 2 methods. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the efficacy of these 2 methods, their superiority to each other, and the incidence of adverse events. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Outpatient department of a single-center pain clinic. METHODS: Sixty patients who did not respond to conservative treatments for lower cervical radicular pain were randomly divided into 2 groups. One group underwent ULSD-SNRPRF (Group U), and the other underwent paramedian FL-CIESI (Group F). Patients were evaluated pretreatment, and 3 and 6 months posttreatment. The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) was used to assess clinical improvement, The Neck Disability Index (NDI) to assess improvement in functional disability, and the Self-Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs Pain Score (S-LANSS) to assess the treatment's effect on neuropathic pain. Clinically significant pain relief was defined as a 50% or more pain reduction in the NRS-11. The posttreatment reduction in medication consumption was assessed using the Medication Quantification Scale Version III (MQS III). We also evaluated whether there was a difference in treatment-related characteristics, such as procedure time and adverse events. RESULTS: The procedure time was significantly longer in Group U. Blood aspiration was observed in 2 patients in Group U and vascular spread in one patient in Group F, with no significant difference. At 3 and 6 months posttreatment, NRS-11 and NDI scores showed a significant decrease compared to the pretreatment scores in both groups; there was no difference between the groups. Both treatments effectively improved neuropathic pain, with no significant difference between the S-LANSS scores. There was no difference in the reduction of medication consumption between the groups. LIMITATIONS: There was no sham or control group, and the follow-up period was limited to 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Pain relief, functional improvement, and safety were similar between groups. ULSD-SNRPRF and paramedian FL-CIESI are 2 different effective techniques for chronic cervical radicular pain. The choice of method should depend on various factors, such as patient preference, operator experience, and availability of resources. An advantage of ULSD over fluoroscopy is that patients and physicians are not exposed to radiation.",0
Same-day discharge after transvenous lead extraction: feasibility and outcomes.,"AIMS: Same-day discharge (SDD) is safe for patients undergoing electrophysiology procedures. There is no existing data regarding SDD for patients undergoing transvenous lead extraction (TLE). We report our experience with SDD for patients undergoing TLE. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study group included patients undergoing TLE between February 2020 and July 2021 without an infectious indication. A modified SDD protocol for device implants/ablations was applied to TLE patients. Patient characteristics, extraction details, outcomes, and complications were reviewed. Of 239 patients undergoing TLE, 210 were excluded (94 infections and 116 did not meet SDD criteria). Of the remaining 29 patients, seven stayed due to patient preference and 22 were discharged home the same day. The SDD group had an average age of 65.9 Â± 12 (47-84), 41% female, and LVEF of 52.2 Â± 18% (10-80). The indication for TLE was malfunction (20), upgrade (4), advisory lead (2), and magnetic resonance imaging compatibility (1). Extractions included four implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), 17 pacemakers (PPM), and one cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)-P system. The leads were 9.6 years (1.5-21.7) old, and 1.8 leads were removed per patient (1-3); the lead extraction difficulty (LED) score was 11.6 Â± 7. Twenty underwent cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) re-implantation (2 ICD, 3 CRT-D, 13 PPM, and 2 CRT-P). For CIED re-implants, patients sent a remote transmission the next day, and all patients received a next-day call. There were no procedure or device-related issues, morbidities, or mortalities in the 30 days after discharge. CONCLUSION: Same-day discharge after TLE for non-infectious aetiologies is safe and feasible in a select group of patients with early procedure completion who meet strict SDD criteria.",0
Surgical Outcomes Following Vestibular Schwannoma Resection in Patients over the Age of Sixty-five.,"Objective âVestibular schwannoma (VS) are benign, often slow growing neoplasms. Some institutions opt for radiosurgery in symptomatic patients of advanced age versus surgical resection. The aim of the study is to analyze surgical outcomes of VS in patients over the age of 65 who were either not candidates for or refused radiosurgery. Methods âThis includes retrospective analysis of VS patients between 1988 and 2020. Demographics, tumor characteristics, surgical records, and clinical outcomes were recorded. Patient preference for surgery over radiosurgery was recorded in the event that patients were offered both. Facial nerve outcomes were quantified using House-Brackmann (HB) scores. Tumor growth was defined by increase in size of >2âmm. Results âIn total, 64 patients were included of average age 72.4 years (65-84 years). Average maximum tumor diameter was 29âmm (13-55âmm). Forty-five patients were offered surgery or GKRS, and chose surgery commonly due to radiation aversion (48.4%). Gross total resection was achieved in 39.1% ( n â=â25), near total 32.8% ( n â=â21), and subtotal 28.1% ( n â=â18). Average hospitalization was 5 days [2-17] with 75% ( n â=â48) discharged home. Postoperative HB scores were good (HB1-2) in 43.8%, moderate (HB3-4) in 32.8%, and poor (HB5-6) in 23.4%. HB scores improved to good in 51.6%, moderate in 31.3%, and remained poor in 17.1%, marking a rate of facial nerve improvement of 10.9%. Tumor control was achieved in 95.3% of cases at an average follow-up time of 37.8 months. Conclusion âVS resection can be safely performed in patients over the age of 65. Advanced age should not preclude a symptomatic VS patient from being considered for surgical resection.",0
Patient preferences regarding treatment options for WaldenstrÃ¶m's macroglobulinemia: A discrete choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Treatment options for WaldenstrÃ¶m's Macroglobulinemia (WM) have expanded rapidly in the last decades. However, there is no consensus on a preferred treatment. Therefore, patient preferences become increasingly important in making individualized treatment plans. Still, WM patients' priorities and perspectives regarding their treatment options are unknown. We evaluated treatment preferences of WM patients using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). METHODS: A mixed-method approach was utilized for identification and selection of attributes/levels. The DCE questionnaire included five attributes: type of agent (targeted versus chemotherapy); frequency and route of administration; 5-year progression-free survival (PFS); adverse events; and risk of secondary malignancies. An orthogonal design and a mixed logit panel data model were used to construct choice tasks and assess patient preferences, respectively. RESULTS: Three hundred thirty WM patients participated in the project. In total, 214 (65%) complete questionnaires were included for data analysis. The 5-year PFS, followed by risk of secondary malignancies were the most important attributes for making treatment choices. Regarding side effects, patients chose to avoid neuropathy the most compared to nausea/vomiting and extreme fatigue. Patients preferred a fixed-duration treatment with IV/SC administration at the hospital over a continuous daily oral regimen at home. CONCLUSION: These are the first systematic data obtained on WM patient preferences for treatment. The results may help discussions with individual patients about their treatment choices. Also, these data can help design clinical trials in WM and inform health-care decision-making regarding outcomes that are most relevant to patients.",1
Treatment decision-making among patients with metastatic prostate cancer: Impact of decision locus of control on functional outcomes and decision satisfaction.,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making (SDM) for metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) engages patients in the decision-making process and may be associated with better outcomes relative to physician- or patient-directed decision-making. We assessed the association between decision locus of control (DLOC) and patient-reported quality of life (QOL), functional outcomes, and decision satisfaction among mPC patients. METHODS: After a clinic visit in which a treatment decision was made (baseline), mPC patients completed DLOC and QOL surveys. QOL was re-assessed at 2- and 4-months post-baseline. Mean scores for each QOL dimension (physical, emotional, cognitive, social, and role functioning) were compared by DLOC group using mixed effects models. Patient preferences for DLOC and provider communication techniques were similarly collected via survey. RESULTS: Median age of participants (Nâ=â101) was 69 years (range: 49-92); most were White (80%) and married (82%). 62% reported using SDM. At baseline, there were no differences in QOL dimensions between DLOC groups. At 4 months, patient-directed (pâ=â0.01) and SDM (pâ=â0.03) were associated with better physical functioning than physician-directed decision-making, and there was an indication of potentially greater decision satisfaction among patients who reported patient-directed (pâ=â0.06) or SDM (pâ=â0.10). SDM was the most reported preferred DLOC. CONCLUSION: mPC patients reporting SDM had better physical functioning at 4 months than physician- or patient-directed decision-making, suggesting measurable benefit from patient involvement in decision-making. Future investigations of these associations in larger, more diverse populations can further clarify these previously unmeasured benefits of patient engagement in treatment decisions.",0
"Patient-Centered Practice Guidelines: GRADEing Evidence to Incorporate Certainty, Balance Between Benefits and Harms, Equity, Feasibility, and Cost-Effectiveness.","The practice of medicine in recent years has emphasized the use of evidence-based clinical guidelines to help inform treatment decisions. Since its development in 2004, the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach has offered a systematic process for reviewing and summarizing the certainty of evidence found in the medical literature regarding various treatment options. To develop truly patient-centered care guidelines, this appraisal of the certainty of evidence must be combined with an understanding of the balance between benefits and harms, patient preferences, equity, feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and policy implications. This review examines each of these domains in detail, exploring the process and benefits of developing relevant, patient-focused guidelines directly applicable to the practice of modern medicine.",0
Long-term oncological outcomes after local excision of T1 rectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: A growing proportion of patients with early rectal cancer is treated by local excision only. The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term oncological outcomes and the impact of local recurrence on overall survival for surgical local excision in pT1 rectal cancer. METHODS: Patients who only underwent local excision for pT1 rectal cancer between 1997 and 2014 in two Dutch tertiary referral hospitals were included in this retrospective cohort study. The primary outcome was the local recurrence rate. Secondary outcomes were distant recurrence, overallÂ survival and the impact of local recurrence on overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients (mean age 68.5âÂ±â10.7Â years, 57.3% males) were included in the study. Median length of follow-up was 58.9Â months (range 6-176Â months). Local recurrence occurred in 22.7% (nâ=â34) of the patients, with a median time to local recurrence of 11.1Â months (range 2.3-82.6Â months). The vast majority of local recurrences were located in the lumen. Five-year overall survival was 82.0%, and landmark analyses showed that local recurrence significantly impacted overall survival at 6 and 36Â months of follow-upÂ (6Â months, pâ=â0.034, 36Â months, pâ=â0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Local recurrence rates after local excision of early rectal cancer can be substantial and may impact overall survival. Therefore, clinical decision-making should be based on patient- and tumour characteristics and should incorporate patient preferences.",0
Co-design of an intervention to improve patient participation in discharge medication communication.,"Patients can experience medication-related harm and hospital readmission because they do not understand or adhere to post-hospital medication instructions. Increasing patient medication literacy and, in turn, participation in medication conversations could be a solution. The purposes of this study were to co-design and test an intervention to enhance patient participation in hospital discharge medication communication. In terms of methods, co-design, a collaborative approach where stakeholders design solutions to problems, was used to develop a prototype medication communication intervention. First, our consumer and healthcare professional stakeholders generated intervention ideas. Next, inpatients, opinion leaders, and academic researchers collaborated to determine the most pertinent and feasible intervention ideas. Finally, the prototype intervention was shown to six intended end-users (i.e. hospital patients) who underwent usability interviews and completed the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability questionnaire. The final intervention comprised of a suite of three websites: (i) a medication search engine; (ii) resources to help patients manage their medications once home; and (iii) a question builder tool. The intervention has been tested with intended end-users and results of the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability questionnaire have shown that the intervention is acceptable. Identified usability issues have been addressed. In conclusion, this co-designed intervention provides patients with trustworthy resources that can help them to understand medication information and ask medication-related questions, thus promoting medication literacy and patient participation. In turn, this intervention could enhance patients' medication self-efficacy and healthcare utilization. Using a co-design approach ensured authentic consumer and other stakeholder engagement, while allowing opinion leaders and researchers to ensure that a feasible intervention was developed.",0
Barriers to the use of clinical practice guidelines: a qualitative study of Danish physiotherapists and chiropractors.,"PURPOSE: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Providing evidence-based practice (EBP) for patients with LBP is more cost-effective compared with non-EBP. To help health care professionals provide EBP, several clinical practice guidelines have been published. However, a relatively poor uptake of the guidelines has been identified across various countries. To enhance future implementation of EBP, the aim of this study was to explore barriers to using LBP guidelines in clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative constructivist grounded theory design was employed in order to gain an in-depth understanding of the barriers. Semi-structured interviews (+/- observations) of nine physiotherapists and nine chiropractors from primary care in the Central Denmark Region were conducted. RESULTS: Two key barriers were found to using guidelines in practice: (1) a scepticism due to doubts about validity and applicability of the guidelines, which emerged particularly among physiotherapists; and (2) a deep biomechanical professional identity, due to perceived role, interest, lack of skills, and patient preferences, which emerged particularly among chiropractors. CONCLUSIONS: For guidelines to be better implemented in practice, these key barriers must be addressed in a tailored strategy. Furthermore, this study showed a difference in barriers between the two professions.",0
