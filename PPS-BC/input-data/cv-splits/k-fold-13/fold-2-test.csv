Factors Associated With Mode of Separation for People With Palliative Diagnoses With Preference for Home Death Receiving Care From a Nurse-Led End of Life (Palliative Extended and Care at Home) Program.,"Palliative Extended and Care at Home (PEACH) is a rapid response nurse-led package of care mobilized for palliative care patients who have an expressed preference to die at home. This study aimed to identify the demographic and clinical predictors of home death for patients receiving the package. Deidentified data were used from administrative and clinical information systems. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess association of sociodemographic factors with mode of separation. Furthermore, 1754 clients received the PEACH package during the study period. Mode of separation was home death (75.7%), hospital/palliative care unit admission (13.5%), and alive/discharged from the PEACH Program (10.8%). Of participants with clear preference to die at home, 79% met their wish. Multivariate analysis demonstrated cancer diagnosis, patients who wished to be admitted when death was imminent, and patients with undecided preference for location of death were associated with an increased likelihood of being admitted to the hospital. Compared with those with spousal caregivers, those cared for by their child/grandchild and other nonspouse caregivers were significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of being admitted to the hospital/palliative care unit. Our results show that opportunities to tailor home care based on referral characteristics to meet patient preference to die at home, at individual, system, and policy levels, exist.",0
How does patient-centered communication influence patient trust?: The roles of patient participation and patient preference.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of patient-centered communication, patient participation, and patient preference on patient trust in the context of China. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted involving 217 cancer patients in China. Mediation and moderation analyses were performed to examine the relationships among the study variables. RESULTS: First, patient-centered communication increased patient participation in decision-making, which, in turn, enhanced patient trust. Second, patient-centered communication did not have a direct effect on patient trust. Third, patient preference for a passive role in decision-making weakened the relationship between patient participation and patient trust. CONCLUSION: The results underscore the significant effect of facilitating patient participation in linking patient-centered communication to patient trust. However, medical communication should also respond to patients' preferred roles in the decision-making process. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Doctors should provide patients with opportunities to ask questions and express their concerns. In addition, they should evaluate patients' preferred degree of involvement before inviting them to contribute so as to respect their preferences and values.",0
Physical therapist clinical reasoning in home care for walking assistive device prescription: A description of practice.,"BACKGROUND: Home care in the United States (US) provides rehabilitative care to people who are homebound after acute hospitalization. Patients with stroke and brain injury (BI) are commonly seen by physical therapists (PTs/PTAs), who often address the loss of walking independence. Clinical reasoning (CR) is required for walking assistive device (WAD) prescription within the home. There has never been a description of the home care PT CR process, which could inform entry-level training and health policy. PURPOSE: To describe the homecare CR process by identifying factors used for prescription of WADs in patients with stroke and BI. Secondly, to describe any practice issues associated with WADs. METHODS: Directors of 7 agencies affiliated with Nazareth College DPT program were recruited to identify PTs/PTAs to complete an online survey between March - July 2017. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected, and analyzed for frequencies or for common themes. RESULTS: A total of 334 PTs/PTAs were enrolled from all agencies and 72 responses were analyzed. The CR process did not differ between stroke and BI. Safety was the primary factor, which was assessed by patient query, observation skills, and objective measures. PTs/PTAs also measured balance, strength, function, cognition, and patient preferences within the context of the home. WADs obtained prior to initiation of home care often weren't used. CONCLUSION: A complex CR process has been described for WAD prescription in home care for patients with stroke and BI. Entry-level training and health policy implications are described.",0
Physiotherapists should apply health coaching techniques and incorporate accountability to foster adherence to a walking program for low back pain: a qualitative study.,"QUESTIONS: What motivates individuals to start a walking program for the prevention of low back pain? What strategies optimise short-term and long-term adherence to a walking program? What strategies can physiotherapists incorporate into clinical practice to facilitate commencement of and adherence to a walking program? DESIGN: Qualitative study. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two adults recently recovered from an episode of non-specific low back pain who participated in a 6-month, progressive and individualised walking program that was prescribed by a physiotherapist trained in health coaching. METHODS: Semi-structured focus groups conducted online following completion of the walking program. Interview questions explored: primary motivations for starting a walking program, identification of which elements were useful in optimising adherence to the program, and identification of the barriers to and facilitators of engagement with the program. Audio recordings were transcribed and thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Three major themes were identified. Theme one identified that strong motivators to start a walking program were anticipated improvements in low back pain management and the added general health benefits of a more active lifestyle. Theme two identified that fear of high-impact exercises led to avoidance; however, walking was considered a safe exercise option. Theme three identified accountability, enjoyment of exercise and health benefits were critical to adherence. CONCLUSION: Participants recently recovered from low back pain reflected positively on a physiotherapist-prescribed walking program. Participants described what elements of the program were crucial to starting exercise and optimising adherence. These findings have informed a list of practical recommendations for physiotherapists to improve patient commencement and adherence to exercise.",0
Identifying patient preferences for diabetes care: A protocol for implementing a discrete choice experiment in Samoa.,"In Samoa, adult Type 2 diabetes prevalence has increased within the past 30 years. Patient preferences for care are factors known to influence treatment adherence and are associated with reduced disease progression and severity. However, patient preferences for diabetes care, generally, are understudied, and other patient-centered factors such as willingness-to-pay (WTP) for diabetes treatment have never been explored in this setting. Discrete Choice Experiments (DCE) are useful tools to elicit preferences and WTP for healthcare. DCEs present patients with hypothetical scenarios composed of a series of multi-alternative choice profiles made up of attributes and levels. Patients choose a profile based on which attributes and levels may be preferable for them, thereby quantifying and identifying locally relevant patient-centered preferences. This paper presents the protocol for the design, piloting, and implementation of a DCE identifying patient preferences for diabetes care, in Samoa. Using an exploratory sequential mixed methods design, formative data from a literature review and semi-structured interviews with n = 20 Samoan adults living with Type 2 diabetes was used to design a Best-Best DCE instrument. Experimental design procedures were used to reduce the number of choice-sets and balance the instrument. Following pilot testing, the DCE is being administered to n = 450 Samoan adults living with diabetes, along with associated questionnaires, and anthropometrics. Subsequently, we will also be assessing longitudinally how preferences for care change over time. Data will be analyzed using progressive mixed Rank Order Logit models. The results will identify which diabetes care attributes are important to patients (p < 0.05), examine associations between participant characteristics and preference, illuminate the trade-offs participants are willing to make, and the probability of uptake, and WTP for specific attributes and levels. The results from this study will provide integral data useful for designing and adapting efficacious diabetes intervention and treatment approaches in this setting.",1
Early Fractional Ablative Laser for Skin Cancer Excision Scars: A Randomized Split-Scar Study.,"BACKGROUND: Fractional ablative laser resurfacing has been shown to improve the final cosmetic appearance of surgical scars, but optimal timing is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare surgical scars treated with fractional carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) laser performed on Day 0 and Day 14. METHODS: Prospective, randomized, split-scar, physician-blinded study of 30 surgical scars on the limbs. Scars halves received fractional CO 2 laser on either Day 0 or Day 14. Scar assessment at 6 months evaluated patient preference, physician modified Manchester Scar Scale (MMSS) score, and quantitative scar analysis on histology (fractal dimension [F D ] and lacunarity [L] analysis). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in patient assessment (54% preferred Day 0 side, 46% preferred Day 14 side, p = .58) or physician assessment (mean MMSS 8.4 for Day 0 vs 8.7 for Day 14, p = .28). Fractal dimensions were similar for both interventions (mean 1.778 for Day 0 vs 1.781 for Day 14, p = .80). Lacunarity was similar for both interventions (mean 0.368 for Day 0 vs 0.345 for Day 14, p = .44). LIMITATIONS: Single-center study with wounds limited to limbs of skin Phototype I-II subjects; 4 of whom were lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Intraoperative CO 2 laser is noninferior to Day 14 laser resurfacing for surgical scar treatment.",0
"Which body functions and activities matter for stroke patients? Study protocol for best-Worst scalings to value core elements of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health.","BACKGROUND: Stroke is a common, serious, and disabling healthcare problem with increasing incidence and prevalence. Following a stroke, identifying the factors associated with decisions about rehabilitation interventions is important to assess rehabilitation after stroke. The aim is to guide clinical staff to make patient-centered decisions. Fundamentally, decision makers cannot draw on evidence to consider the relevance of distinct functions and activities from the patient's perspective. Until now, outcomes of rehabilitation are generally categorized using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). This can be seen as a conceptual basis for the assessment of health and disability. Since the ICF does not distinguish importance between these aspects there is a need to value the most important clinical factors as well as related activities from a patients and public perspective to help guide therapists in effectively designing post-acute rehabilitation care for individuals following stroke. The research question is which ICF body functions and activities are of value to stroke patients? Which trade-offs are patients willing to make within the core elements? Health preference research (HPR) answers the need to develop additional preference weights for certain ICF dimensions. Patient preference information (PPI) values health conditions based on the ICF from a patient perspective. METHODS: In this study we conduct three best-worst scaling (BWS) experiments to value body function and activities from patients' and public perspective. Out of all ICF dimensions this research covers health conditions relevant to stroke patients in terms of body function, perception, and activities of daily living. Stroke patients as well as members of the general population will be recruited to participate in the online BWS surveys. Fractional, efficient designs are applied regarding the survey design. Conditional and multinominal logit analyses will be used as the main analysis method, with the best-worst count analysis as a secondary analysis. The survey is being piloted prior to commencing the process of data collection. Results are expected by the autumn of 2023. DISCUSSION: The research will add to the current literature on clinical decision-making in stroke rehabilitation and the value of certain body functions as well as related activities in neurorehabilitation. Moreover, the study will show whether body functions and activities that are currently equally weighted in international guidelines are also equally important from the point of view of those affected, or whether there are disconcordances in terms of differences between public judgements and patients' preferences.",1
Preferences for risks and benefits of treatment outcomes for chronic low back pain: Choice-based conjoint measure development and discrete choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Understanding individual patient preferences for chronic low back pain (cLBP) outcomes is essential for targeting available therapeutic options; yet tools to elicit patient outcome preferences are limited. OBJECTIVE: To develop and test a choice-based conjoint (CBC) measure, commonly used in behavioral economics research, to elicit what outcomes patients with cLBP want to achieve and avoid. DESIGN: We developed a survey-based CBC measure to allow patients to make risk/benefit trade-off choices between possible treatment outcomes. After extensive literature, clinician, and patient input, our measure included seven attributes: fatigue, anxiety/depression, difficulty thinking/making decisions, pain intensity, physical abilities, change in pain, and ability to enjoy life despite pain. Random-parameters logit models were used to estimate strength of preferences, and latent class analysis was used to identify patient characteristics associated with distinct preference. SETTING: Online study using the Sawtooth web-based platform. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eleven individuals with cLBP recruited from online advertising as well as at clinical sites across multiple academic and private institutions. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. RESULTS: The most valued outcome was the highest level of physical activity (β = 1.6-1.98; p < .001), followed by avoiding cognitive difficulties (β = -1.48; p < .001). Avoidance of severe pain was comparable to avoiding constant fatigue and near-constant depression/anxiety (β = -0.99, -1.02); p < .001). There was an association between preferences and current pain/disability status; patients with higher pain had a stronger preference to avoid severe pain, whereas those with higher disability have stronger preferences for achieving physical activity. The latent class analysis identified two distinct groups: (1) more risk-seeking and willing to accept worse outcomes (56%); and (2) more risk-averse with a stronger preference for achieving maximum benefits (44%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study illuminated cLBP patient preferences for treatment outcomes and heterogeneity in these preferences. Patients stressed the importance of reaching high physical activity and avoiding cognitive declines, even over a desire to avoid pain. More work is needed to understand patient preferences to aid informed, shared decisions.",1
Parent's preferences for unscheduled paediatric healthcare: A discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Unscheduled healthcare is a key component of healthcare delivery and makes up a significant proportion of healthcare access, with children being particularly high users of unscheduled healthcare. Understanding the relative importance of factors that influence this behaviour and decision-making is fundamental to ensuring the system is best designed to meet the needs of users and foster appropriate cost-effective usage of health system resources. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify the parent's preferences for unscheduled healthcare for a common mild childhood illness. DESIGN: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was developed to identify the preferences of parents accessing unscheduled healthcare for their children. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected from parents in Ireland (N = 458) to elicit preferences across five attributes: timeliness, appointment type, healthcare professional attended, telephone guidance before attending and cost. RESULTS: Using a random parameters logit model, all attributes were statistically significant, cost (β = -5.064, 95% confidence interval, CI [-5.60, -4.53]), same-day (β = 1.386, 95% CI [1.19, 1.58]) or next-day access (β = 0.857, 95% CI [0.73, 0.98]), coupled with care by their own general practitioner (β = 0.748, 95% CI [0.61, 0.89]), identified as the strongest preferences of parents accessing unscheduled healthcare for their children. DISCUSSION: The results have implications for policy development and implementation initiatives that seek to improve unscheduled health services as understanding how parents use these services can maximise their effectiveness. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: The development of the DCE included a qualitative research component to ensure that the content accurately reflected parents experiences when seeking healthcare. Before data collection, a pilot test was carried out with the target population to gather their views on the survey.",1
Physician-led medication reviews in polypharmacy patients treated with at least 12 medications in a type 2 diabetes outpatient clinic: A randomised trial.,"AIMS: Medication reviews can be used to promote appropriate pharmacotherapy and negate the harmful consequences of polypharmacy. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of physician-led medication reviews and increased cross-sectoral communication as a supplement to standard care in a type 2 diabetes outpatient clinic. METHODS: This pragmatic randomised clinical trial enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes treated with at least 12 medications. The subjects were randomised to either standard care (standard care consultation at the outpatient clinic) or standard care plus a medication review consultation and increased cross-sectoral communication. The primary outcome was the number of medications used after six months. Health-related quality of life was quantified using the EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level (EQ5D-5 L) questionnaire. RESULTS: We recruited 50 participants with a median age of 72 (IQR 67-75) years. The mean number of medications per patient changed from 17.9 to 14.3 in the intervention group and 17.6 to 17.2 in the control group (rate ratio 0.81). The reasons for discontinuations were medication no longer indicated (60%), safety issues (20%), efficacy issues (15%) or patient preferences (5%). There was a significant difference in the change in health-related quality of life (EQ5D-5 L index score) in favour of the intervention (0.111, 95% CI 0.001 to 0.221). CONCLUSIONS: Physician-led medication reviews and increased cross-sectoral communication in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with at least 12 medications reduced the number of medications used and improved health-related quality of life. Implementing and further investigating similar interventions as standard care seems reasonable.",0
Patient and Public Willingness to Share Personal Health Data for Third-Party or Secondary Uses: Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: International advances in information communication, eHealth, and other digital health technologies have led to significant expansions in the collection and analysis of personal health data. However, following a series of high-profile data sharing scandals and the emergence of COVID-19, critical exploration of public willingness to share personal health data remains limited, particularly for third-party or secondary uses. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to explore factors that affect public willingness to share personal health data for third-party or secondary uses. METHODS: A systematic search of 6 databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and SocINDEX) was conducted with review findings analyzed using inductive-thematic analysis and synthesized using a narrative approach. RESULTS: Of the 13,949 papers identified, 135 were included. Factors most commonly identified as a barrier to data sharing from a public perspective included data privacy, security, and management concerns. Other factors found to influence willingness to share personal health data included the type of data being collected (ie, perceived sensitivity); the type of user requesting their data to be shared, including their perceived motivation, profit prioritization, and ability to directly impact patient care; trust in the data user, as well as in associated processes, often established through individual choice and control over what data are shared with whom, when, and for how long, supported by appropriate models of dynamic consent; the presence of a feedback loop; and clearly articulated benefits or issue relevance including valued incentivization and compensation at both an individual and collective or societal level. CONCLUSIONS: There is general, yet conditional public support for sharing personal health data for third-party or secondary use. Clarity, transparency, and individual control over who has access to what data, when, and for how long are widely regarded as essential prerequisites for public data sharing support. Individual levels of control and choice need to operate within the auspices of assured data privacy and security processes, underpinned by dynamic and responsive models of consent that prioritize individual or collective benefits over and above commercial gain. Failure to understand, design, and refine data sharing approaches in response to changeable patient preferences will only jeopardize the tangible benefits of data sharing practices being fully realized.",0
Use of LetibotulinumtoxinA for Aesthetic Treatment of Asians: A Consensus.,"Treatment of wrinkles and dynamic lines with botulinum toxin has been a routine practice for years in aesthetic clinical settings. The effective treatment of wrinkles requires a comprehensive understanding of facial expression muscles and their interactions, the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin, and individual patient preferences. The dose adjustment practice and injection technique of physicians are affected by cultural differences; most Asian patients prefer natural-looking results. This article aims to present an expert consensus on the injection sites, doses, and levels of botulinum toxin for various indications in Asians, with the hope of providing guidance to some clinicians. This consensus paper reviews LetibotulinumtoxinA for patient evaluation, dosage, and delivery techniques in Asians from the time LetibotulinumtoxinA was approved up to December 2022. Panelists proposed individualized treatment plans for botulinum toxin type A (BTxA) treatments in 3 areas-wrinkle removal, contour adjustment, and face lifting-for Asians based on their extensive experience and knowledge of facial anatomy. When using a different BTxA, clinicians should start with a conservative dose and carefully individualize the treatment for each patient, and adjust it according to feedback to obtain a higher satisfaction level.",0
Patient preferences for anti-hyperglycaemic medication for type 2 diabetes mellitus in China: findings from a national survey.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the preferences regarding risks, benefits and other treatment attributes of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in China when selecting a second-line anti-hyperglycaemic medicine. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment with hypothetical anti-hyperglycaemic medication profiles was performed using a face-to-face survey administered to patients with T2DM. The medication profile was described using seven attributes: treatment efficacy, hypoglycaemia risk, cardiovascular benefits, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events, weight change, mode of administration and out-of-pocket cost. Participants chose between medication profiles by comparing attributes. Data were analysed using a mixed logit model with marginal willingness to pay (mWTP) and maximum acceptable risk (MAR) calculated. The preference heterogeneity within the sample was explored using a latent class model (LCM). RESULTS: A total of 3327 respondents from five major geographical regions completed the survey. Treatment efficacy, hypoglycaemia risk, cardiovascular benefits and GI adverse events were major concerns among the seven attributes measured. Weight change and mode of administration were of lesser concern. Regarding mWTP, respondents would pay ¥236.1 (US$36.6) for an anti-hyperglycaemic medication with an efficacy of 2.5% points reduction in HbA1c, while they were willing to accept a weight gain of 3 kg only if they received a compensation of ¥56.7 (US$8.8). Respondents were willing to accept a relatively large increase in hypoglycaemia risk (MAR=15.9%) to improve treatment efficacy from intermediate (1.0% points) to high (1.5% points). LCM identified the following four unobserved subgroups: trypanophobia, cardiovascular-benefits-focused, safety-focused and efficacy-focused and cost-sensitive. CONCLUSION: Patients with T2DM prioritised free out-of-pocket costs, highest efficacy, no hypoglycaemia risk and cardiovascular benefits over weight change and mode of administration. There exists great preference heterogeneity among patients, which should be taken into account in healthcare decision-making processes.",1
Clinical Trial Design Challenges and Opportunities for Emerging Treatments for Opioid Use Disorder: A Review.,"IMPORTANCE: Novel treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) are needed to address both the ongoing opioid epidemic and long-standing barriers to existing OUD treatments that target the endogenous μ-opioid receptor (MOR) system. The goal of this review is to highlight unique clinical trial design considerations for the study of emerging treatments for OUD that address targets beyond the MOR system. In November 2019, the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION) public-private partnership with the US Food and Drug Administration sponsored a meeting to discuss the current evidence regarding potential treatments for OUD, including cannabinoids, psychedelics, sedative-hypnotics, and immunotherapeutics, such as vaccines. OBSERVATIONS: Consensus recommendations are presented regarding the most critical elements of trial design for the evaluation of novel OUD treatments, such as: (1) stage of treatment that will be targeted (eg, seeking treatment, early abstinence/detoxification, long-term recovery); (2) role of treatment (adjunctive with or independent of existing OUD treatments); (3) primary outcomes informed by patient preferences that assess opioid use (including changes in patterns of use), treatment retention, and/or global functioning and quality of life; and (4) adverse events, including the potential for opioid-related relapse or overdose, especially if the patient is not simultaneously taking maintenance MOR agonist or antagonist medications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Applying the recommendations provided here as well as considering input from people with lived experience in the design phase will accelerate the development, translation, and uptake of effective and safe therapeutics for individuals struggling with OUD.",0
Approach to Obesity Treatment in Primary Care: A Review.,"IMPORTANCE: More than 40% of US adults have obesity, which increases the risks for multiple chronic diseases and premature mortality. Historically, nonsurgical interventions often have not led to sufficient weight loss and maintenance to improve health, but highly effective antiobesity medications (AOMs) have recently become available, and additional effective therapeutics are under development. Given that most medical care for adults with obesity is delivered in primary care settings, guidance for integrating weight-management approaches is needed. OBSERVATIONS: Lifestyle interventions can lead to a mean weight loss of 2% to 9% of initial weight at 1 year and increase the likelihood of weight loss of 5% or more, but weight regain over time is common even with continued treatment. Adjunctive treatments, including AOMs and surgical approaches, can lead to larger, more sustained weight loss and improvements in numerous obesity-associated medical conditions. Highly effective AOMs, including nutrient-stimulated hormone-based therapies, induce mean weight loss of 15% or more. Barriers to intervention, including access to care, have a disproportionate influence on populations most affected by obesity and its consequences. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Primary care clinicians play a vital role in the assessment, management, and support of patients with obesity. With careful clinical assessment and shared decision-making, a flexible treatment plan can be developed that reflects evidence of treatment efficacy, patient preference, and feasibility of implementation. Adjunctive therapies to lifestyle interventions, including more effective pharmacotherapeutics for obesity, offer hope to patients and the potential for considerable improvements in health and quality of life.",0
"From a Patient Choice Perspective: Nearly 20 Years on, Has Patient Choice Improved or Was I Just Lucky?","With Watch & Wait becoming a more recognised approach to the treatment of early-stage lower rectal cancers I wanted to look at what has changed in nearly 20 years from a patient's perspective. In 2003 I was diagnosed with a T3a tumour and offer radical surgery but found Papillon and was lucky that it worked and I'm still here. Since then, things have improved but I still have patients contacting me saying they are being given no options - so I pose the question: From a Patient Choice Perspective: Nearly 20 Years on, Has Patient Choice Improved or Was I Just Lucky?",0
"Person-centered strategies for delivering TB diagnostic services in Lima, Peru.","SETTING: Lima, Peru. OBJECTIVE: To close the gap in TB diagnosis, TB diagnostic services must match care-seeking preferences. We sought to identify preferred strategies for delivering TB diagnostic services and to determine whether preferences differ among demographic groups. DESIGN: During May 2022-January 2023, we recruited adults who recently initiated treatment for pulmonary TB. We used an object-case best-worst scaling instrument to assess the desirability of nine hypothetical strategies for delivering TB diagnostic services. A t-test was used to assess differences in preference scores between groups. RESULTS: Among 150 participants, the strategies with the highest preference scores were an integrated mobile unit offering screening for multiple conditions, expedited attention at the health center, and home-based screening. These were strongly preferred by 42%, 25%, and 27% of participants, respectively, and 80% of participants strongly preferred at least one of the three. Expedited attention at the health center scored more highly among people who experienced >2 months delay in TB diagnosis compared to those who experienced a more rapid diagnosis (0.37 ± 0.06 vs. 0.17 ± 0.06; P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: Providing person-centered TB diagnostic services at diverse access points could help reach different populations, which could promote early diagnosis and help close the diagnosis gap.",1
Modified forced expiration technique using expiratory resistance in adults with cystic fibrosis.,"BACKGROUND: Participation in airway clearance techniques (ACT) is important to minimise development of irreversible airway obstruction in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) and expiratory resistance devices (ERD) are often used as they can improve collateral ventilation and aid in the shearing of mucus from airways. This project looked to identify whether utilising an ERD during a forced expiration technique (FET) improves ease of expectoration, sputum amount and coughing frequency in patients with CF. METHOD: Patients with CF admitted for a respiratory exacerbation completed two sessions of 10 cycles of their usual ACT with half of the FET components performed with an ERD, half with FET alone. RESULTS: EOE, sputum wet weight, cough frequency and patient preference were similar between groups. Improved EOE without the ERD was found in participants who usually use PEP for their ACT regime. CONCLUSION: Combining the FET with a PEP mask did not improve EOE and other outcomes in this small study. Investigating the efficacy of this technique within a larger population is warranted.",0
Treatment Algorithm for Management of Benign Prostatic Obstruction: An Overview of Current Techniques.,"The management of benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) should involve a treatment algorithm that takes into account prostate size, and patient's symptoms and preference with the aim of helping with urinary symptoms and enhance quality of life. The diagnostic assessment for men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) should be comprehensive to help choose the best management strategy. Strategies from lifestyle modifications to medical treatment with alpha blockers and/or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors to surgical procedures can all be used in the management algorithm. Surgical management ranges from transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) to minimally invasive surgical therapies (MIST) including laser therapies such as Holmium laser enucleation (HoLEP) and photoselective vaporisation (PVP), aquablation, Rezūm system, prostate artery embolisation (PAE), prostatic urethral lift (PUL), temporary implantable nitinol device (iTind) and Optilume BPH catheter system. BPO is a common urological condition that has a significant impact on quality of life and economic burden globally and is likely to become increasingly prevalent with an ageing population. Selecting the most appropriate treatment modality will depend on the individual patient preferences, availability of resources, cost, anatomical factors and the goals of treatment.",0
Anticoagulant treatment of cancer-associated thromboembolism.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent and potentially fatal complication in patients with cancer. During the initial period after the thromboembolic event, a patient receiving anticoagulant treatment is exposed both to a risk of VTE recurrence and also to an elevated bleeding risk conferred by the treatment. For this reason, the choice of anticoagulant is critical. The choice should take into account patient-related factors (such as functional status, age, body mass index, platelet count and renal function), VTE-related factors (such as severity or site), cancer-related factors (such as activity and progression) and treatment-related factors (such as drug-drug interactions), which all potentially influence bleeding risk, and patient preference. These should be evaluated carefully for each patient during a multidisciplinary team meeting. For most patients, apixaban or a low molecular-weight heparin is the most appropriate initial choice for anticoagulant treatment. Such treatment should be offered to all patients with active cancer for at least six months. The patient and treatment should be re-evaluated regularly and anticoagulant treatment changed when necessary. Continued anticoagulant treatment beyond six months is justified if the cancer remains active or if the patient experienced recurrence of VTE in the first six months. In other cases, the interest of continued anticoagulant treatment may be considered on an individual patient basis in collaboration with oncologists.",0
Intentional replantation and dental autotransplantation of mandibular posterior teeth: Two case reports.,"BACKGROUND: Intentional replantation and dental autotransplantation are 2 similar techniques both involving atraumatic tooth extraction, visualization of the root, and replantation. They are considered as the last resort for unsalvageable teeth. The author aims to describe 2 mandibular posterior teeth with serious periapical lesions which are resolved by intentional replantation and dental autotransplantation, respectively. CASE SUMMARY: In case 1, a 45-year-old male patient received root canal treatment because of a cracked mandible right first molar with periapical lesions. An endodontic file was separated in the apical third of the mesiolingual root canal. After conventional canal filling of the other root canals, the molar was atraumatically extracted. The separated instrument was removed, the mesiolingual root received a retrograde filling and the molar was replanted. At the 3-month follow up, the patient was asymptomatic and the X-ray picture showed no detectable root resorption and ankylosis. In case 2, a 29-year-old woman reported discomfort during occlusal loading after a root canal treatment and a coronal restoration of the mandibular right first molar. Radiographs showed a low-density shadow in the mesial apical and in the root furcation area of the mandibular first molar so the patient was diagnosed as chronic periapical periodontitis. After the removal of the affected tooth, the extraction socket was thoroughly debrided and irrigated. The intact mandibular right third molar with similar dimensions was extracted by minimally invasive procedure and transplanted. The donor tooth was fixed by a fiber-splint for 1 month and a root canal treatment was performed 2 weeks after surgery. After 1 year, clinical and radiographical examination revealed functional and periodontal healing. CONCLUSIONS: These 2 reports present the successful management of intentional replantation and dental autotransplantation. Both procedures are recommended after nonsurgical endodontic treatment, especially when apical microsurgery is not an option, for example because of difficult accessibility or patient preference.",0
A Randomized Clinical Trial of Clinician-Supported PTSD Coach in VA Primary Care Patients.,"BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in primary care patients; however, evidence-based treatments are typically only available in specialty mental healthcare settings and often not accessed. OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of a brief primary care-based treatment, Clinician-Supported PTSD Coach (CS PTSD Coach) was compared with Primary Care Mental Health Integration-Treatment as Usual (PCMHI-TAU) in (1) reducing PTSD severity, (2) engaging veterans in specialty mental health care, and (3) patient satisfaction with care. DESIGN: Multi-site randomized pragmatic clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 234 veterans with PTSD symptoms who were not currently accessing PTSD treatment. INTERVENTION: CS PTSD Coach was designed to be implemented in Veterans Affairs PCMHI and combines mental health clinician support with the ""PTSD Coach"" mobile app. Four 30-min sessions encourage daily use of symptom management strategies. MAIN MEASURES: PTSD severity was measured by clinician-rated interviews pre- and post-treatment (8 weeks). Self-report measures assessed PTSD, depression, and quality of life at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 16- and 24-week follow-ups, and patient satisfaction at post-treatment. Mental healthcare utilization was extracted from medical records. KEY RESULTS: Clinician-rated PTSD severity did not differ by condition at post-treatment. CS PTSD Coach participants improved more on patient-reported PTSD severity at post-treatment than TAU participants (D = .28, p = .021). Coach participants who continued to have problematic PTSD symptoms at post-treatment were not more likely to engage in 2 sessions of specialty mental health treatment than TAU participants. Coach participants engaged in 74% more sessions in the intervention and reported higher treatment satisfaction than TAU participants (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: A structured 4-session intervention designed to align with patient preferences for care resulted in more patient-reported PTSD symptom relief, greater utilization of mental health treatment, and overall treatment satisfaction than TAU, but not more clinician-rated PTSD symptom relief or engagement in specialty mental health.",0

Racial/Ethnic Minority Identifying Family Physicians Are More Likely to Work in Solo Practices.,"While the overall proportion of family physicians who work in solo practices has been steadily declining, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian family physicians are more likely to work in these settings. Given their association with high levels of continuity and improved health outcomes, and given patient preference for racial concordance with their physicians, policy makers and payors should consider how to support family physicians in solo practice in the interest of promoting access to and quality of care for ethnic/racial minorities.",0
The Longest Known Survival of a Patient With Bioprosthetic Aortic Valve Replacement: A 42-Year Follow-Up.,"Aortic valve replacement (AVR) is a frequently performed procedure for treating aortic valvulopathy. AVR involves replacing the damaged aortic valve with either a mechanical or a bioprosthetic valve. While many factors are involved when selecting between the two options, age and patient preference are the deciding factors at this point. Mechanical valves demonstrate long-standing durability that overlaps with the accompanied bleeding risk due to lifetime anticoagulant therapy, making them a more favorable choice for younger patients. Bioprosthetic valves are preferred for older patients as they show a reduced risk of thrombogenicity. However, bioprosthetic valves have a higher incidence of structural valve degeneration (SVD) than mechanical valves. Our case report focuses on a 76-year-old patient who had undergone an AVR with a bioprosthetic valve at the age of 33, which has still not demonstrated any valve deterioration. As the longest known case of bioprosthetic durability, this patient provides useful data for designing bioprosthetic valves more resistant to structural degeneration and thereby better suited to younger patients or those at higher risk of bleeding.",0
Patient-oriented educational Sports Medicine YouTube videos in Arabic have higher view counts in the Middle East and North Africa than their English versions.,"PURPOSE: The present study aims to assess the impact of the local language on the view count of patient-oriented educational Sports Medicine videos in an Orthopaedic and Sports Medicine Hospital in the Middle East and North Africa. METHODS: An observational study on English and Arabic versions of Aspetar's YouTube channel patient-oriented educational video series was conducted in February 2023, comparing the view count and viewer characteristics. Included videos were posted either simultaneously or in English version first, in both languages, and shared on the same media platforms. Collected data of interest included video title, view count in each language, age and sex of the viewers, location, and traffic source. RESULTS: Eleven videos of the patient-oriented educational video series were included in the present study. Except for one, the view count was significantly higher in the Arabic version of all 11 videos (minimum sevenfold, P = 0.03). Viewers were predominantly males (73.9%) and between 18 and 44 years old (81.1%). Eleven out of 19 countries of the Middle East and North Africa region [11] were among the viewers' top 20 countries. Traffic sources included YouTube search (45.9%), YouTube suggested videos (17%), external sources (14.4%), YouTube browse features (8.5%), and YouTube advertising (6%). CONCLUSION: Patient-oriented educational Sports Medicine videos in Arabic yield higher view counts than their English version in young adult viewers from 11 countries in the Middle East and Africa among the top 20. Content creation on languages with limited online representation could effectively reach the targeted population by breaking language barriers.",0
Patient Priorities Concerning Treatment Decisions for Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors Identified by Discrete Choice Experiments.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) have multiple treatment options. Ideally, treatment decisions are shared between physician and patient; however, previous studies suggest that oncologists and patients place different value on treatment attributes such as adverse event (AE) rates. High-quality information on NET patient treatment preferences may facilitate patient-centered decision making by helping clinicians understand patient priorities. METHODS: This study used 2 discrete choice experiments (DCE) to elicit preferences of NET patients regarding advanced midgut and pancreatic NET (pNET) treatments. The DCEs used the ""potentially all pairwise rankings of all possible alternatives"" (PAPRIKA) method. The primary objective was to determine relative utility rankings for treatment attributes, including progression-free survival (PFS), treatment modality, and AE rates. Ranking of attribute profiles matching specific treatments was also determined. Levels for treatment attributes were obtained from randomized clinical trial data of NET treatments. RESULTS: One hundred and 10 participants completed the midgut NET DCE, and 132 completed the pNET DCE. Longer PFS was the highest ranked treatment attribute in 64.5% of participants in the midgut NET DCE, and in 59% in the pNET DCE. Approximately, 40% of participants in both scenarios prioritized lower AE rates or less invasive treatment modalities over PFS. Ranking of treatment profiles in the midgut NET scenario identified 60.9% of participants favoring peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), and 30.0% somatostatin analogue dose escalation. CONCLUSION: NET patients have heterogeneous priorities when choosing between treatment options based on the results of 2 independent DCEs. These results highlight the importance of shared decision making for NET patients.",1
Emerging space for non-polyethene-glycol bowel preparations in inflammatory bowel disease-related colonoscopy: Veering toward better adherence and palatability.,"Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) require repeated endoscopic evaluations over time by colonoscopy to weigh disease activity but also for different and additional indications (e.g., evaluation of postoperative recurrence, colorectal cancer surveillance). Colonoscopy, however, requires adequate bowel preparation to be of quality. The latter is achieved as long as the patient takes a certain amount of product to have a number of bowel movements suitable to clean the colon and allow optimal visualization of the mucosa during endoscopy. However, significant guidelines recommend preparations for patients with IBD not excelling in palatability. This recommendation originates from the fact that most of the studies conducted on bowel preparations in patients with IBD have been done with isosmolar preparations based on polyethylene glycol (PEG), for which, therefore, more safety data exist. As a result, the low-volume non-PEG preparations (e.g., magnesium citrate plus picosulphate, oral sulphate solutions) have been set aside for the whole range of warnings to be heeded because of their hyperosmolarity. New studies, however, are emerging, leaning in overall for a paradigm shift in this matter. Indeed, such non-PEG preparations seem to show a particularly encouraging and engaging safety profile when considering their broad potential for tolerability and patient preference. Indeed, such evidence is insufficient to indicate such preparations in all patients with IBD but may pave the way for those with remission or well-controlled disease. This article summarizes the central studies conducted in IBD settings using non-PEG preparations by discussing their results.",0
Tretinoin 0.1% and Benzoyl Peroxide 3% Cream for the Treatment of Facial Acne Vulgaris.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, safety, and clinical application of tretinoin 0.1%-benzoyl peroxide 3% cream for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review of the literature was performed using the terms Twyneo OR tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide OR S6G5T-3 in MEDLINE (PubMed) and EMBASE. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to obtain completed clinical trial results not published elsewhere. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All human studies published in English prior to November 2022 related to pharmacology, clinical trials, safety, and efficacy were evaluated for inclusion. DATA SYNTHESIS: In two 12-week, phase 3, randomized, vehicle-controlled clinical trials, tretinoin 0.1%-benzoyl peroxide 3% cream significantly reduced inflammatory and noninflammatory facial acne lesions and significantly improved Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) rating to clear or almost clear. The cream has a suitable safety profile, with application site pain and dryness as the most common adverse events. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE IN COMPARISON TO EXISTING AGENTS: Tretinoin-BPO had similar IGA success compared to other topical retinoid and retinoid-BPO treatments for acne vulgaris. Compared to individual tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide therapy, the combination product streamlines application, which will improve medication adherence; however, the cost of tretinoin-BPO cream may be prohibitive. CONCLUSIONS: Tretinoin 0.1%-benzoyl peroxide 3% cream is safe and effective for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acne. Long-term trial data on efficacy and tolerability are not yet available.",0
Telemedicine Implementation for Safety Net Populations: A Systematic Review.,"Background: Telemedicine systems were rapidly implemented in response to COVID-19. However, little is known about their effectiveness, acceptability, and sustainability for safety net populations. This study systematically reviewed primary care telemedicine implementation and effectiveness in safety net settings. Methods: We searched PubMed for peer-reviewed articles on telemedicine implementation from 2013 to 2021. The search was done between June and December 2021. Included articles focused on health care organizations that primarily serve low-income and/or rural populations in the United States. We screened 244 articles from an initial search of 343 articles and extracted and analyzed data from N = 45 articles. Results: Nine (20%) of 45 articles were randomized controlled trials. N = 22 reported findings for at least one marginalized group (i.e., racial/ethnic minority, 65 years+, limited English proficiency). Only n = 19 (42%) included African American/Black patients in demographics descriptions, n = 14 (31%) LatinX/Hispanic patients, n = 4 (9%) Asian patients, n = 4 (9%) patients aged 65+ years, and n = 4 (9%) patients with limited English proficiency. Results show telemedicine can provide high-quality primary care that is more accessible and affordable. Fifteen studies assessed barriers and facilitators to telemedicine implementation. Common barriers were billing/administrative workflow disruption (n = 9, 20%), broadband access/quality (n = 5, 11%), and patient preference for in-person care (n = 4, 9%). Facilitators included efficiency gains (n = 6, 13%), patient acceptance (n = 3, 7%), and enhanced access (n = 3, 7%). Conclusions: Telemedicine is an acceptable care modality to deliver primary care in safety net settings. Future studies should compare telemedicine and in-person care quality and test strategies to improve telemedicine implementation in safety net settings.",0
"Preference-based patient participation in intermediate care: Translation, validation and piloting of the 4Ps in Norway.","INTRODUCTION: The implementation and evaluation of patient participation to obtain high-quality transitional care for older people is an international priority. Intermediate care (IC) services are regarded as an important part of the patient's pathway from the specialist to the primary care levels, bridging the gap between the hospital and the home. Patients may experience varying capacities and conditions for patient participation. Yet, few tools for evaluating patients' preferences for patient participation within IC services are at hand. Accordingly, further knowledge is needed to understand and scaffold processes for patient participation in IC. Therefore, the aim of this project was to translate, validate and pilot test the Patient Preferences for Patient Participation (the 4Ps) with patients in IC services in Norway. METHODS: This project comprised two phases: (1) a careful translation and cultural adaptation process, followed by a content validity trial among 15 patients and staff in Norwegian IC and (2) a cross-sectional survey of the instrument with 60 patients admitted to IC. RESULTS: The translation between Swedish and Norwegian required no conceptual or contextual adaptations. The subsequent cross-sectional study, designed as a dialogue between the patients and staff, revealed that only 50% of the participants received a sufficient level of patient participation based on their preferences, mostly indicating that patients were receiving less-than-preferred conditions for engaging in their health and healthcare issues. CONCLUSION: The 4Ps instrument was deemed suitable for measuring patient participation based on patient preferences in the IC context and was feasible for both healthcare professionals and patients to complete in an interview when arriving at and leaving services. This may support person-centred communication and collaboration, calling for further research on what facilitates patient participation and the implementation of person-centred services for patients in IC. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: First, the current paper is part of the IPIC study (i.e., the implementation of patient participation in IC). Influenced by a James Lind Alliance process, the study addresses research uncertainties identified by patients, next of kin, staff and researchers in the cocreation process. Second, cognitive interviewing was conducted with 15 representatives of the target population: seven patients receiving IC services, one home-dwelling previous IC patient (altogether four women and four men, most of them 80 years or older) and seven healthcare staff working in IC services. The interviews determined the relevance, comprehensiveness and clarity of the 4Ps. Finally, 60 patients admitted to IC took part in the cross-sectional study.",0
[Vestibular Schwannoma: Factors in Therapy Decision-Making].,"The treatment of vestibular schwannomas (VS) has always posed a challenge for physicians. Three essential treatment principles are available: wait-and-scan, surgery, and stereotactic radiotherapy. In addition to the type of treatment, decisions must be made regarding the optimal timing of therapy, the combination of different treatment modalities, the potential surgical approach, and the type and intensity of radiation. Factors influencing the therapy decision include tumor location and size or stage, patient age, comorbidities, symptoms, postoperative hearing rehabilitation options, patient preferences, and, not least, the experience of the surgeons and the personnel and technical capabilities of the clinical site. This article begins with a brief overview of vestibular schwannomas, then outlines the fundamental interdisciplinary treatment options, and finally discusses the ENT (ear, nose, and throat)-relevant factors in the therapy decision.",0
"Patient experiences of, and preferences for, surgical wound care education.","The aim of this study was to describe patients' experiences of, and preferences for, surgical wound care discharge education and how these experiences predicted their ability to self-manage their surgical wounds. A telephone survey of 270 surgical patients was conducted across two hospitals two weeks after discharge. Patients preferred verbal (n = 255, 94.8%) and written surgical wound education (n = 178, 66.2%) from medical (n = 229, 85.4%) and nursing staff (n = 211, 78.7%) at discharge. The most frequent education content that patients received was information about follow-up appointments (n = 242, 89.6%) and who to contact in the community with wound care concerns (n = 233, 86.6%). Using logistic regression, patients who perceived that they participated in surgical wound care decisions were 6.5 times more likely to state that they were able to manage their wounds at home. Also, patients who agreed that medical and/or nursing staff discussed wound pain management were 3.1 times more likely to report being able to manage their surgical wounds at home. Only 40% (107/270) of patients actively participated in wound-related decision-making during discharge education. These results uncovered patient preferences, which could be used to optimise discharge education practices. Embedding patient participation into clinical workflows may enhance patients' self-management practices once home.",0
'My doctor should decide' - Predictors for healthcare users' stated preferences regarding medical decision-making.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate predictors for healthcare users' declared decision control preferences and test their association with satisfaction in vignettes detailing various decision-making. METHODS: Cross-sectional vignette survey within a representative general male population aged 45-70 years (response rate 30%). Survey vignettes illustrated different levels of patient involvement. Participants rated their satisfaction with healthcare illustrated and separately rated their 'control preferences'. Comparisons were conducted with linear regression. RESULTS: Preferring the doctor to predominantly or exclusively decide (1588/6755 respondents) was associated with older age, being single, lower education, having chronic illness, and living in low-income and less populated areas, with fewer non-western immigrants. Following adjustment, lower education and chronic illness remained statistically significant. Personalities with less openness had preference for least control. When presented with specific clinical scenarios, respondents preferring active or passive roles were equally satisfied with scenarios demonstrating shared decision-making. DISCUSSION: Some groups of healthcare users were more likely to say that they preferred their doctor to decide. However, findings suggest that control preference statements, prior to facing a decision, should be interpreted with caution. PRACTICAL VALUE: Study findings highlight that patients vary regarding their expressed wish for control in medical decision-making but they seem equally satisfied with shared decision-making scenarios.",0
Facilitators and barriers to using telemedicine for gender-affirming care in gender-diverse youth: A qualitative study.,"INTRODUCTION: Access to gender-affirming care (GAC) is limited for gender-diverse (GD) youth, with the potential for further limitations given the current political climate. GAC has been shown to improve the mental health of GD youth and telemedicine (TM) could increase access to GAC. With limited data on the acceptability and feasibility of TM for GAC among GD youth, we sought to further explore their perspectives on the use of TM in their care. METHODS: We used a semi-structured interview guide, with prompts developed to explore participants' knowledge of TM, identify factors that influenced use, and advantages or disadvantages of use. RESULTS: Thirty GD participants aged 13-21 years old participated in TM. While TM was not the preferred option for medical visits, it was recognized as a practical option for providing GAC. Various actual and perceived disadvantages noted by youth included, technical issues interrupting the visit, not receiving care equivalent to that of an in-person visit, having to see themselves on the screen, family members interrupting visits, and meeting new staff while connecting to a TM visit. The advantages, however, were an increased autonomy and convenience of TM, especially when used for specific aspects of GAC. DISCUSSION: The use of TM in GAC could be optimized by limiting camera use, eliminating/reducing staff involvement, being sensitive to privacy issues, and alternating TM with in-person visits. Clinicians should be cognizant of patient preferences and concerns and be flexible with visit types.",0
Racial Inequities in Access to Ventricular Assist Device and Transplant Persist After Consideration for Preferences for Care: A Report From the REVIVAL Study.,"BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in access to advanced therapies for heart failure (HF) patients are well documented, although the reasons remain uncertain. We sought to determine the association of race on utilization of ventricular assist device (VAD) and transplant among patients with access to care at VAD centers and if patient preferences impact the effect. METHODS: We performed an observational cohort study of ambulatory chronic systolic HF patients with high-risk features and no contraindication to VAD enrolled at 21 VAD centers and followed for 2 years in the REVIVAL study (Registry Evaluation of Vital Information for VADs in Ambulatory Life). We used competing events cause-specific proportional hazard methodology with multiple imputation for missing data. The primary outcomes were (1) VAD/transplant and (2) death. The exposures of interest included race (Black or White), additional demographics, captured social determinants of health, clinician-assessed HF severity, patient-reported quality of life, preference for VAD, and desire for therapies. RESULTS: The study included 377 participants, of whom 100 (26.5%) identified as Black. VAD or transplant was performed in 11 (11%) Black and 62 (22%) White participants, although death occurred in 18 (18%) Black and 36 (13%) White participants. Black race was associated with reduced utilization of VAD and transplant (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.23-0.85]) without an increase in death. Preferences for VAD or life-sustaining therapies were similar by race and did not explain racial disparities. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients receiving care by advanced HF cardiologists at VAD centers, there is less utilization of VAD and transplant for Black patients even after adjusting for HF severity, quality of life, and social determinants of health, despite similar care preferences. This residual inequity may be a consequence of structural racism and discrimination or provider bias impacting decision-making. REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.

Low Trend for VZV-Associated Disease Patients to Visit Neurologists.,"BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster (HZ) is a skin disease that can also cause virus-infectious peripheral neuropathies. Despite this, there is limited information on patient preferences for seeking medical attention for HZ and zoster-associated pain (ZAP). Our study aimed to evaluate how frequently patients with ZAP choose to visit neurologists for their symptoms. METHODS: This study conducted a retrospective review of electronic health records in three general hospitals from January 2017 to June 2022. Using association rule mining, the study analyzed referral behaviors. RESULTS: We identified 33,633 patients with 111,488 outpatient visits over 5.5 years. The study found that the majority of patients (74.77-91.22%) visited dermatologists during their first outpatient visit, while only a small percentage (0.86-1.47%) preferred to consult a neurologist. The proportion of patients referred to a specialist during their medical visit varied significantly between different specialties within the same hospital (p <0.05) and even within the same specialty (p<0.05). There was a weak association (Lift:1.00-1.17) of referral behaviors between dermatology and neurology. Across the three hospitals, the average number of visits to a neurologist for ZAP was 1.42-2.49, with an average electronic health record duration of 11-15 days per patient. After consulting with a neurologist, some patients were referred to other specialists. CONCLUSION: It was observed that patients with HZ and ZAP tended to visit a variety of specialists, with only a small number seeking the assistance of neurologists. However, from the perspective of neuroprotection, it is the duty of neurologists to provide more means.",0
Topical Vehicles: A Dermatologist's Perspective.,"Topical treatment is mainstay for a variety of dermatologic conditions. There are several different types of topical vehicles, and choosing the most appropriate one is an essential part of treatment. Selection can vary depending on factors such as patient preference and anatomical location. Each topical vehicle has unique advantages and disadvantages that are important to consider. This article reviews some of the most common topical vehicles used in dermatology.",0
"European Society of Endocrinology clinical practice guidelines on the management of adrenal incidentalomas, in collaboration with the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors.","Adrenal incidentalomas are adrenal masses detected on imaging performed for reasons other than suspected adrenal disease. In most cases, adrenal incidentalomas are nonfunctioning adrenocortical adenomas but may also require therapeutic intervention including that for adrenocortical carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, hormone-producing adenoma, or metastases. Here, we provide a revision of the first international, interdisciplinary guidelines on incidentalomas. We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system and updated systematic reviews on 4 predefined clinical questions crucial for the management of incidentalomas: (1) How to assess risk of malignancy?; (2) How to define and manage mild autonomous cortisol secretion?; (3) Who should have surgical treatment and how should it be performed?; and (4) What follow-up is indicated if the adrenal incidentaloma is not surgically removed? Selected Recommendations: (1) Each adrenal mass requires dedicated adrenal imaging. Recent advances now allow discrimination between risk categories: Homogeneous lesions with Hounsfield unit (HU) ≤ 10 on unenhanced CT are benign and do not require any additional imaging independent of size. All other patients should be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert meeting, but only lesions >4 cm that are inhomogeneous or have HU >20 have sufficiently high risk of malignancy that surgery will be the usual management of choice. (2) Every patient needs a thorough clinical and endocrine work-up to exclude hormone excess including the measurement of plasma or urinary metanephrines and a 1-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (applying a cutoff value of serum cortisol ≤50 nmol/L [≤1.8 µg/dL]). Recent studies have provided evidence that most patients without clinical signs of overt Cushing's syndrome but serum cortisol levels post dexamethasone >50 nmol/L (>1.8 µg/dL) harbor increased risk of morbidity and mortality. For this condition, we propose the term ""mild autonomous cortisol secretion"" (MACS). (3) All patients with MACS should be screened for potential cortisol-related comorbidities that are potentially attributably to cortisol (eg, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus), to ensure these are appropriately treated. (4) In patients with MACS who also have relevant comorbidities surgical treatment should be considered in an individualized approach. (5) The appropriateness of surgical intervention should be guided by the likelihood of malignancy, the presence and degree of hormone excess, age, general health, and patient preference. We provide guidance on which surgical approach should be considered for adrenal masses with radiological findings suspicious of malignancy. (6) Surgery is not usually indicated in patients with an asymptomatic, nonfunctioning unilateral adrenal mass and obvious benign features on imaging studies. Furthermore, we offer recommendations for the follow-up of nonoperated patients, management of patients with bilateral incidentalomas, for patients with extra-adrenal malignancy and adrenal masses, and for young and elderly patients with adrenal incidentalomas. Finally, we suggest 10 important research questions for the future.",0
Evaluating Patient Preferences and Clinical Outcomes in Stress Urinary Incontinence Treatment: A Short-Term Follow-Up Study of the Transobturator Tape Procedure and Pubourethral Ligament Plication (a Minimally Invasive Technique).,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide an in-depth analysis of patient preferences and clinical outcomes associated with two surgical techniques for treating stress urinary incontinence (SUI): the transobturator suburethral sling (TOT) procedure and the pubourethral ligament plication (PUL) procedure. We evaluated the rates of postoperative complications, the duration of each procedure, hemoglobin loss, and days of hospitalization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 80 patients who underwent surgery for SUI: 40 patients for the TOT procedure and 40 patients for the PUL procedure. Clinical data on patient characteristics, treatment efficacy, and post-surgical outcomes were analyzed to assess patient preferences and real-world clinical effectiveness. RESULTS: Regarding patient preferences, those who underwent TOT surgery were more likely to be older, had a higher average number of pregnancies, and were more often postmenopausal, in contrast to those who underwent PUL surgery (p < 0.001 for each comparison). TOT patients had a hospital stay on average of 1.02 days, while PUL patients benefited from ambulatory stays only. In addition, the TOT group had a significantly longer average operating time (16.80 min) compared to the PUL group (9.90 min, p < 0.001). The study revealed notable outcomes in both groups, with high cure rates for both TOT (N(1) = 33, 82.5%) and PUL (N(2) = 28, 70%) procedures. Specifically, 76.25% of the patients (61 out of 80) were cured after the procedures. Chronic pelvic pain was present in 3.75% of all patients and was notably only observed in the TOT group, with 3 (7.5%) cases being noted. Similarly, vaginal erosion was experienced by 5% of all patients, with 10% of patients in the TOT group and none in the PUL group being affected. Dyspareunia occurred in 2.5% of all patients, with there being two (5%) cases in the TOT group and none in the PUL group. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights that while the PUL procedure achieves cure rates comparable to TOT, it offers a less invasive option with shorter operating times and no hospitalization required. These findings suggest that PUL could be a viable alternative for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) treatment, especially in contexts where avoiding mesh use is preferred. This adds significant value to patient-centered care in SUI management, offering tailored treatment options based on patient characteristics, preferences, and risk profiles.",0
Exploring patient treatment decision making for osteoarthritis in the UAE: a cross-sectional adaptive choice-based conjoint study.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess osteoarthritis (OA) patients' preferences for pharmaceutical treatment via Adaptive Choice-Based Conjoint (ACBC) method. METHODS: A United Arab Emirates (UAE) based Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) group designed the ACBC questionnaire with 10 attributes and 34 levels. The questionnaire was developed using Sawtooth Software and analyzed through Hierarchical Bayesian (HB). Results were standardized using Z-score via SPSS. RESULTS: Study participants were 1030 OA patients, 83.6% aged 50 or older and 83.4% female. The avoidance of medication's side effects accounted for 66% relative importance compared to 6% relative importance for the medication's benefits. The ""way of taking the medicine"" attribute had the highest coefficient of variation (70%) and the four side effect attributes ""risk of gastric ulcer, addiction, kidney and liver impairment, and heart attacks and strokes"" had a coefficient of variation from 18 to 21%. CONCLUSIONS: Arab OA patients are similar to other ethnic groups in trading-off benefits and side effects and consistently prioritizing the avoidance of medications' side effects. Although the ""Way of taking medicine"" was the least important attribute it was associated with the highest variation amongst patients. OA patients also prefer prescribed medications to internet-purchased and over-the-counter options.",1
Availability and use of web-based interventions for patients with head and neck cancer: a scoping review.,"PURPOSE: To identify and review the nature, scope and use of web-based interventions for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). METHOD: A scoping review guided by the methodological framework described by the Joanna Briggs Institute was performed to review empirical studies and websites. Seven electronic databases (CINAHL, Medline, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane, PubMed and PsycInfo) were searched from 2010 to 2020, data extracted and synthesised using thematic analysis. The Google search engine was employed, identifying the first 100 websites, using the search term head and neck cancer. Websites meeting eligibility criteria were assessed using the QUEST analysis tool, and descriptively summarised. RESULTS: Thirteen empirical studies and 32 websites were included. As identified by empirical studies, web-based interventions were developed to provide (1) patient information on HNC and related treatments, (2) advice and support during treatment and (3) management strategies promoting adjustment to life with and beyond HNC. The reviewed websites provided minimal information to aid shared decision-making and facilitate preparedness for treatment, with few utilising patient narratives. Web-based interventions for HNC patients were mainly text based and focused on survivorship. CONCLUSIONS: There is a paucity of theory-based, co-designed web-based interventions using patient narratives. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: As patients increasingly look to the internet for advice and support, healthcare professionals are in a position to provide high-quality web-based interventions. There is an opportunity to rigorously develop a web-based intervention, containing narratives of peoples' lives before and after HNC treatment, aiding decision-making, preparedness for treatment and self-management.",0
"Patient Preferences for Long-Term Implant Care in Cochlear, Glaucoma and Cardiovascular Diseases.","In the process of developing and implementing innovative implant technologies the consideration of patient preferences can be beneficial for patients, doctors and developers. Nevertheless, in existing literature, there is still scarce knowledge of patients' perspectives on long-term implant care. In this study, three discrete choice experiments (DCEs) were conducted in the context of cochlear implants (CI, n = 92), glaucoma implants (GI, n = 21) and cardiovascular implants (CVI, n = 23), examining the relative importance of attributes of long-term implant care from the patients' perspective. The participants chose between differently shaped options for implant-related care. The attributes of these care options were generated and selected based on previous literature reviews, group discussions and a diary study with patients. The choice data were analyzed via binary logit regression. In CI-DCE, the technological compatibility of the implant with newer implant models, accessories or devices from other manufacturers was highly valued by participants, whereas in GI-DCE the (in)dependency on glaucoma medication post-implantation had the greatest influence on participants' choice behavior. In CVI-DCE, the attribute with the highest relative importance related to the means of securing long-term treatment success. In all three DCE, shared decision making was relatively important for participants. Our results emphasized the importance of an adequate transfer of technological advancements in implant care for promoting patient benefits, such as the availability of comprehensible, understandable, high-quality information about current developments. Similarly, promoting technological health literacy and further pushing the technological compatibility, durability and safety of implants are directions for future implant development in accordance with patients' preferences. Therefore, the participation of implant wearers in the development process is encouraged.",1
Preparation for cardiac procedures: a cross-sectional study identifying gaps between outpatients' views and experiences of patient-centred care.,"BACKGROUND: To examine and identify gaps in care perceived as essential by patients; this study examined outpatients': 1) views on what characterises essential care and 2) experiences of care received, in relation to cardiac catheterisation and subsequent cardiovascular procedures. METHODS: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Surveys were posted to outpatients who had undergone elective cardiac catheterisation in the prior six months at an Australian hospital. Participants completed a 65-item survey to determine: a) aspects of care they perceive as essential to patients receiving care for a cardiac condition (Important Care Survey); or b) their actual care received (Actual Care Survey). Numbers and percentages were used to calculate the most frequently identified essential care items; and the experiences of care received. Items rated as either 'Essential'/'Very important' by at least 80% of participants were determined. A gap in patient-centred care was identified as being any item that was endorsed as essential/very important by 80% or more of participants but reported as received by less than 80% of participants. RESULTS: Of 582 eligible patients, 264 (45%) returned a completed survey. 43/65 items were endorsed by > 80% of participants as essential. Of those, for 22 items, <80% reported the care as received. Gaps were identified in relation to GP consultation (1 item), preparation (1 item) subsequent decision making for treatment (1 item), prognosis (6 items) and post-treatment follow-up (1 item). CONCLUSIONS: Areas were identified where actual care fell short of patients' perceptions of essential care.",0
Evaluating Policies of Expanding Versus Restricting First-Line Treatment Choices: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Framework.,"OBJECTIVES: Healthcare payers often implement coverage policies that restrict the utilization of costly new first-line treatments. Cost-effectiveness analysis can be conducted to inform these decisions by comparing the new treatment with an existing one. However, this approach may overlook important factors such as treatment effect heterogeneity and endogenous treatment selection, policy implementation costs, and diverse patient preferences across multiple treatment options. We aimed to develop a cost-effectiveness analysis framework that considers these real-world factors, facilitating the evaluation of alternative policies related to expanding or restricting first-line treatment choices. METHODS: We introduced a metric of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) that compares an expanded choice set (CS) including the new first-line treatment with a restricted CS excluding the new treatment. ICER(CS) accounts for treatment selection influenced by heterogeneous treatment effects and policy implementation costs. We examined a basic scenario with 2 standard first-line treatment choices and a more realistic scenario involving diverse preferences toward multiple choices. To illustrate the framework, we conducted a retrospective evaluation of including versus excluding abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AAP) (androgen deprivation therapy [ADT] + AAP) as a first-line treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. RESULTS: The traditional ICERs for ADT + AAP versus ADT alone and ADT+ docetaxel were $104 269 and $206 324/quality-adjusted life-year, respectively. The ICER(CS) for comparing an expanded CS with ADT + AAP with a restricted CS without ADT + AAP was $123 179/quality-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework provides decision makers with policy-relevant tools, enabling them to assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative policies of expanding versus restricting patients' and physicians' first-line treatment choices.",0
Demystifying Dry Powder Inhaler Resistance with Relevance to Optimal Patient Care.,"The selection of an inhaler device is a key component of respiratory disease management. However, there is a lack of clarity surrounding inhaler resistance and how it impacts inhaler selection. The most common inhaler types are dry powder inhalers (DPIs) that have internal resistance and pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) that use propellants to deliver the drug dose to the airways. Inhaler resistance varies across the DPIs available on the market, depending largely on the design geometry of the device but also partially on formulation parameters. Factors influencing inhaler choice include measures such as flow rate or pressure drop as well as inhaler technique and patient preference, both of which can lead to improved adherence and outcomes. For optimal disease outcomes, device selection should be individualised, inhaler technique optimised and patient preference considered. By addressing the common clinically relevant questions, this paper aims to demystify how DPI resistance should guide the selection of the right device for the right patient.",0
"Comparing Tubeless and Tubed Approaches in Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy for Moderate Renal Calculi: Outcomes on Safety, Efficacy, Pain Management, Recovery Time, and Cost-Effectiveness.","Introduction This study focuses on investigating the effect of routine nephrostomy tube placement in patients with moderate renal calculi of size 2.5 cm or less who undergo uncomplicated percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) procedures. Previous studies have not specified whether only uncomplicated cases were included in the analysis, which may affect the results. This study aims to provide a clearer understanding of the effect of routine nephrostomy tube placement on blood loss in a more homogeneous patient population. Materials and methods A prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted at our department over 18 months, dividing 60 patients with a single renal or upper ureteric calculus of size ≤2.5 cm into two groups: 30 patients in each group (group 1: tubed PCNL, group 2: tubeless PCNL). The primary outcome was the drop in perioperative hemoglobin level and the number of packed cell transfusions necessary. The secondary outcome included the mean pain score, analgesic requirement, length of hospital stay, time to return to normal activities, and the total cost of the procedure. Results The two groups were comparable in age, gender, comorbidities, and stone size. The postoperative hemoglobin level was significantly lower in the tubeless PCNL group (9.56 ± 2.13 gm/dL) compared to the tube PCNL group (11.32 ± 2.35 gm/dL) (p = 0.0037), and two patients in the tubeless group required blood transfusion. The duration of surgery, pain scores, and analgesic requirement were comparable between the two groups. The total procedure cost was significantly lower in the tubeless group (p = 0.0019), and the duration of hospital stay and time to return to daily activities were significantly shorter in the tubeless group (p < 0.0001). Conclusions Tubeless PCNL is a safe and effective alternative to conventional tube PCNL, with the advantages of shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, and lower procedure costs. Tube PCNL is associated with less blood loss and the need for transfusions. Patient preferences and bleeding risk should be considered when choosing between the two procedures.",0
Derivation of a UK preference-based value set for the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS) to allow estimation of Mental Well-being Adjusted Life Years (MWALYs).,"BACKGROUND: The Mental Well-being Adjusted Life Year (MWALY) is an alternative outcome measure to the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in economic evaluations of interventions aimed at improving mental well-being. However, there is a lack of preference-based mental well-being instruments for capturing population mental well-being preferences. OBJECTIVES: To derive a UK preference-based value set for the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS). METHODS: 225 participants that were interviewed between December 2020 and August 2021 completed 10 composite time trade-off (C-TTO) and 10 discrete choice experiment (DCE) interviewer-administered exercises. Heteroskedastic Tobit and conditional logit models were used to model C-TTO and DCE responses respectively. The DCE utility values were rescaled to a C-TTO comparable scale through anchoring and mapping. An inverse variance weighting hybrid model (IVWHM) was used to derive weighted-average coefficients from the modelled C-TTO and DCE coefficients. Model performance was assessed using statistical diagnostics. RESULTS: The valuation responses confirmed the feasibility and face validity of the C-TTO and DCE techniques. Apart from the main effects models, statistically significant associations were estimated between the predicted C-TTO value and participants' SWEMWBS scores, gender, ethnicities, education levels, and the interaction terms between age and useful feeling. The IVWHM was the most optimal model with the fewest logically inconsistent coefficients and the lowest pooled standard errors. The utility values generated by the rescaled DCE models and the IVWHM were generally higher than those of the C-TTO model. The predictive ability of the two DCE rescaling methods was similar according to the mean absolute deviation and root mean square deviation statistics. CONCLUSIONS: This study has produced the first preference-based value set for a measure of mental well-being. The IVWHM provided a desirable blend of both C-TTO and DCE models. The value set derived by this hybrid approach can be used for cost-utility analyses of mental well-being interventions.",1
Preference for and impact of telehealth vs in-person asthma visits among Black and Latinx adults.,"BACKGROUND: Black and Latinx adults experience disproportionate asthma-related morbidity and limited specialty care access. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic expanded telehealth use. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate visit type (telehealth [TH] vs in-person [IP]) preferences and the impact of visit type on asthma outcomes among Black and Latinx adults with moderate-to-severe asthma. METHODS: For this PREPARE trial ancillary study, visit type preference was surveyed by e-mail or telephone post-trial. Emergency medical record data on visit types and asthma outcomes were available for a subset (March 2020 to April 2021). Characteristics associated with visit type preferences, and relationships between visit type and asthma outcomes (control [Asthma Control Test] and asthma-related quality of life [Asthma Symptom Utility Index]), were tested using multivariable regression. RESULTS: A total of 866 participants consented to be surveyed, with 847 respondents. Among the participants with asthma care experience with both visit types, 42.0% preferred TH for regular checkups, which associated with employment (odds ratio [OR] = 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-2.39; P = .02), lower asthma medication adherence (OR = 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11; P = .03), and having more historical emergency department and urgent care asthma visits (OR = 1.10 for each additional visit; 95% CI, 1.02-1.18; P = .02), after adjustment. Emergency medical record data were available for 98 participants (62 TH, 36 IP). Those with TH visits were more likely Latinx, from the Southwest, employed, using inhaled corticosteroid-only controller therapy, with lower body mass index, and lower self-reported asthma medication adherence vs those with IP visits only. Both groups had comparable Asthma Control Test (18.4 vs 18.9, P = .52) and Asthma Symptom Utility Index (0.79 vs 0.84, P = .16) scores after adjustment. CONCLUSION: TH may be similarly efficacious as and often preferred over IP among Black and Latinx adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, especially for regular checkups.

Patient Preferences for Treatment Attributes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Results From a Large Survey Across Seven European Countries Using a Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease requires long-term treatment; therefore, understanding patient preferences is important in aiding informed treatment decision making. This study explored patients' preferences for treatment attributes of available inflammatory bowel disease therapies. METHODS: Adult patients from 7 European countries who self-reported previous/current treatment for Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) participated in an online survey via the Carenity platform. In a discrete choice experiment, the relative importance of treatment attributes for CD and UC was estimated using conditional logit models. Latent class analysis was conducted to estimate heterogeneous treatment preferences based on patient profiles. Patients' perspectives and preferences regarding their quality of life were assessed. RESULTS: Across 686 completed survey responses (CD, n = 360; UC, n = 326), the mean patient age was 48 and 50 years, respectively. Patients with CD ranked route of administration as the most important attribute (attribute importance: 32%), preferring subcutaneous over intravenous treatment (P < .001). Patients with UC ranked route of administration and frequency of serious adverse events as the most important attributes (attribute importance: 31% and 23%, respectively), preferring oral (P < .001) and subcutaneous (P < .001) over intravenous treatment and treatment that minimized the risk of serious adverse events (P < .001) or mild adverse events (P < .01). Latent class analyses confirmed the impact of patients' sociodemographic profile on their preferences. All patients prioritized general well-being, energy level, and daily activities as the most important aspects for improvement through treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Patient preferences for treatment attributes varied among patients with CD or UC, highlighting the importance of personalized care and shared decision making to maximize treatment benefits.",1
The Impact of Patient Preference on Attendance and Completion Rates at Centre-Based and mHealth Pulmonary Rehabilitation: A Non-Inferiority Pragmatic Clinical Trial.,"PURPOSE: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is vital in the management of chronic respiratory disorders (CRDs) although uptake, attendance and completion are poor. Differing models of delivering PR are emerging in an attempt to increase the uptake and completion of this intervention. This study aimed to evaluate participant rate of attendance and completion of PR when given a preference regarding model of delivery (centre-based and mPR). Secondary aims were to evaluate the factors affecting patient preference for model of delivery and determine whether mPR is non-inferior to centre-based PR in health outcomes. METHODS: A multi-centre non-inferiority preference based clinical trial in Auckland, New Zealand. Participants with a CRD referred for PR were offered the choice of centre-based or mHealth PR (mPR). The primary outcome was completion rate of chosen intervention. RESULTS: A total of 105 participants were recruited to the study with 67 (64%) preferring centre-based and 38 (36%) mPR. The odds of completing the PR programme were higher in the centre-based group compared to mPR (odds ratio 1.90 95% CI [0.83-4.35]). Participants opting for mPR were significantly younger (p = 0.002) and significantly more likely to be working (p = 0.0001). Results showed that mPR was not inferior to centre-based regarding changes in symptom scores (CAT) or time spent in sedentary behaviour (SBQ). When services were forced to transition to telehealth services during COVID-19 restrictions, the attendance and completion rates were higher with telephone calls and video conferencing compared to mPR - suggesting that synchronous interpersonal interactions with clinicians may facilitate the best attendance and completion rates. CONCLUSION: When offered the choice of PR delivery method, the majority of participants preferred centre-based PR and this facilitated the best completion rates. mPR was the preferred choice for younger, working participants suggesting that mPR may offer a viable alternative to centre-based PR for some participants, especially younger, employed participants.",0
"A discrete choice experiment to elicit preferences for a liver screening programme in Queensland, Australia: a mixed methods study to select attributes and levels.","BACKGROUND: In Australia, the overall prevalence of liver disease is increasing. Maximising uptake of community screening programmes by understanding patient preferences is integral to developing consumer-centred care models for liver disease. Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are widely used to elicit preferences for various healthcare services. Attribute development is a vital component of a well-designed DCE and should be described in sufficient detail for others to assess the validity of outcomes. Hence, this study aimed to create a list of potential attributes and levels which can be used in a DCE study to elicit preferences for chronic liver disease screening programmes. METHODS: Key attributes were developed through a multi-stage, mixed methods design. Focus groups were held with consumers and health care providers on attributes of community screening programmes for liver disease. Stakeholders then prioritised attributes generated from the focus group in order of importance via an online prioritisation survey. The outcomes of the prioritisation exercise were then reviewed and refined by an expert panel to ensure clinically meaningful levels and relevance for a DCE survey. RESULTS: Fifteen attributes were generated during the focus group sessions deemed necessary to design liver disease screening services. Outcomes of the prioritisation exercise and expert panel stages recognised five attributes, with three levels each, for inclusion in a DCE survey to elicit consumer preferences for community screening for liver disease. This study also highlights broader social issues such as the stigma around liver disease that require careful consideration by policy makers when designing or implementing a liver screening programme. CONCLUSIONS: The attributes and levels identified will inform future DCE surveys to understand consumer preferences for community screening programmes for liver disease. In addition, the outcomes will help inform the implementation of the LOCATE-NAFLD programme in real-world practice, and could be relevant for other liver and non-liver related chronic disease screening programmes.",1
A rapid umbrella review of the literature surrounding the provision of patient-centred end-of-life care.,"BACKGROUND: Patients have reported a broad range of unmet needs in their receipt of clinical care at the end of life. Therefore, enhancing the quality of end-of-life care through patient-centred healthcare interactions is warranted. AIM: The aim of this rapid umbrella review was to synthesise previous literature reviews that have examined: (1) patient preferences for patient-centred end-of-life care; (2) barriers and enablers to patient-centred end-of-life care; (3) interventions designed to enhance patient-centred end-of-life care; and (4) patient-centred models of end-of-life care. DESIGN: A rapid umbrella review was conducted and informed by the Joanna Briggs Institute's methodological guidance for conducting umbrella reviews. DATA SOURCES: Three academic databases were searched for relevant literature in May 2022: MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL Plus. Inclusion criteria encompassed literature reviews that examined the topic of patient-centred care for any adult patients in end-of-life care. RESULTS: A total of 92 literature reviews were identified. Findings suggest that there is often a discrepancy between patient preferences and the provision of care. These discrepancies have been associated with a range of barriers at the patient, staff and system levels. Common interventions included education and training for staff which were often met with improved patient outcomes. Patient-centred models of care were underrepresented across the literature. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlighted a need for healthcare systems to support staff in providing a patient-centred end of life experience through the development of a co-designed patient-centred model of care, supplemented by professional development and a systematic approach to identifying and documenting patient preferences.",0
Impact of Potential Symptoms and Risks Associated with Acid Sphingomyelinase Deficiency on Patients and Caregivers: A Best-Worst Scaling Study.,"PURPOSE: Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) is a rare, progressive, and potentially fatal disease affecting major organs; its symptoms present heterogeneously. Data on the most bothersome symptoms for patients with ASMD types B or A/B and their caregivers or parents are limited. We conducted a survey to quantify the relative impact of potential ASMD symptoms and risks for patients and parents/caregivers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty respondents, recruited via National Niemann-Pick Disease Foundation (United States) and Niemann-Pick United Kingdom, took a preference survey: 11 patients who had a self-reported diagnosis of ASMD types B or A/B and 9 parents who had a child with ASMD types B or A/B. Using object-case best-worst scaling, we explored the most and least bothersome among a set of 15 ASMD symptoms/risks selected based on clinical input and qualitative research with patients and caregivers. In 15 experimentally designed questions containing five items each, respondents ranked the symptoms/risks, irrespective of their experiences with them. Data were analyzed using a conditional multinomial logit model. RESULTS: Patients reported constant abdominal pain, severe pain in bones and joints, and severe fatigue to be the most bothersome potential symptoms or risks, followed by a chance of bleeding in the spleen. The next most bothersome potential symptom was constant shortness of breath. Easy bruising and noticeable abdominal enlargement were among the least bothersome symptoms. The most bothersome symptom for parents was bleeding in the spleen. CONCLUSION: Patients and parents had similar perceptions of the most bothersome potential symptoms/risks. Despite the small sample size typical of rare disease studies, understanding patient preferences is important for such diseases and can inform shared decision-making.",1
Treatment Rechallenge With Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Advanced Urothelial Carcinoma.,"OBJECTIVES: To examine patient and disease characteristics, toxicity, and clinical outcomes for patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma (aUC) who are rechallenged with immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort, we included patients treated with ICI for aUC after having prior ICI treatment. Endpoints included the evaluation of radiographic response and disease control rates with first and second ICI courses, outcomes based on whether there was a change in ICI class (anti-PD-1 vs. anti-PD-L1), and assessment of the reasons for ICI discontinuation. RESULTS: We identified 25 patients with aUC from 9 institutions who received 2 separate ICI courses. ORR with first ICI and second ICI were 39% and 13%, respectively. Most patients discontinued first ICI due to progression (n = 19) or treatment-related toxicity (n = 4). Thirteen patients received non-ICI treatment between the first and second ICI, and 12 patients changed ICI class (anti-PD-1 vs. anti-PD-L1) at rechallenge. Among 10 patients who changed ICI class, 8 (80%) had progressive disease as best response with second ICI, while among 12 patients re-treated with the same ICI class, only 3 (25%) had progressive disease as best response at the time of rechallenge. With second ICI, most patients discontinued treatment due to progression (n = 18) or patient preference (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: A proportion of patients with aUC rechallenged with ICI-based regimens may achieve disease control, supporting clinical trials in that setting, especially with ICI-based combinations. Future studies are needed to validate our results and should also focus on identifying biomarkers predictive of benefit with ICI rechallenge.",0
Outpatient and Minor Burn Treatment.,"Burn injuries are common; most burn injuries may be considered minor and are suitable for outpatient management. Steps should be taken to ensure that patients managed in this way still retain access to the full burns multidisciplinary team, and that admission remains an option if complications develop or according to patient preference. Modern antimicrobial dressings, outreach nursing teams, and the use of telemedicine means that the number of patients that can be safely managed without hospital admission is likely to increase further.",0
Factors Important to Patient Decision-Making After Ulnar Collateral Ligament Injury in Competitive High School and Collegiate Baseball Players.,"BACKGROUND: Patients are faced with several treatment decisions after an ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injury: nonoperative versus operative treatment, repair versus reconstruction, and immediate versus delayed surgery. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The aim of this study was to investigate the factors important to patients when deciding which treatment to pursue after a UCL injury. We hypothesized that (1) length of time away from sports and seasonal timing would be important to patients and (2) treatment decision-making would be heavily influenced by how many and which seasons of their baseball career would be missed. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: High school and collegiate baseball players with UCL tears treated at an academic institution were surveyed retrospectively on their sports participation at the time of injury and their UCL injury treatment decisions. Respondents rated the influence of various factors on a 5-point Likert scale, and they selected the top 3 factors and the single most important factor influencing their treatment decisions. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between player characteristics and factors important to their treatment decision. RESULTS: A total of 83 athletes completed the survey; 40 were in high school and 43 were in college at the time of injury; 7 were treated nonoperatively and 76 underwent surgery (66 immediately and 10 in a delayed fashion), 10 with UCL repair and 66 with UCL reconstruction. The ability to play competitive baseball in the long term was very important or extremely important to 90% of players, while the ability to play in the short term was very important or extremely important to 17%. Length of recovery and seasonal timing were also important factors for 53% and 54% of players, respectively, and almost all (90%) highly valued advice from a surgeon. Possible failure of nonoperative treatment leading to increased time away and the possible loss of 2 consecutive baseball seasons heavily influenced decision-making in 41% of respondents. CONCLUSION: Survey respondents were driven by the desire to play baseball in the long term. Treatment decisions were influenced by the length of recovery and by the seasonal timing of their injury, both of which affect how many and which seasons of baseball a player may miss. Patients found advice from their surgeon to be extremely important to decision-making.",0
Survival Outcomes in Older Women with Oestrogen-Receptor-Positive Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Primary Endocrine Therapy vs. Surgery by Comorbidity and Frailty Levels.,"Primary endocrine therapy (PET) offers non-surgical treatment for older women with early-stage breast cancer who are unsuitable for surgery due to frailty or comorbidity. This research assessed all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality of PET vs. surgery in older women (≥70 years) with oestrogen-receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer by frailty and comorbidity levels. This study used UK secondary data to analyse older female patients from 2000 to 2016. Patients were censored until 31 May 2019 and grouped by the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and hospital frailty risk score (HFRS). Cox regression models compared all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality between PET and surgery within each group, adjusting for patient preferences and covariates. Sensitivity analyses accounted for competing risks. There were 23,109 patients included. The hazard ratio (HR) comparing PET to surgery for overall survival decreased significantly from 2.1 (95%CI: 2.0, 2.2) to 1.2 (95%CI: 1.1, 1.5) with increasing HFRS and from 2.1 (95%CI: 2.0, 2.2) to 1.4 (95%CI 1.2, 1.7) with rising CCI. However, there was no difference in BCSM for frail older women (HR: 1.2; 0.9, 1.9). There were no differences in competing risk profiles between other causes of death and breast cancer-specific mortality with PET versus surgery, with a subdistribution hazard ratio of 1.1 (0.9, 1.4) for high-level HFRS (p = 0.261) and CCI (p = 0.093). Given limited survival gains from surgery for older patients, PET shows potential as an effective option for frail older women with early-stage breast cancer. Despite surgery outperforming PET, surgery loses its edge as frailty increases, with negligible differences in the very frail.",0
Survival rates of systemic interventions for psoriasis in the Western Japan Psoriasis Registry: A multicenter retrospective study.,"Psoriasis affects approximately 0.3% of the Japanese population. Recently, various effective systemic drugs have become available, and the continuation of a given treatment has become critical because of the chronic nature of psoriasis. Factors affecting drug survival (the time until treatment discontinuation) in psoriasis treatment include efficacy, safety, ease of use, and patient preference. In the present study, the authors retrospectively surveyed a multifacility patient registry to determine the real-world evidence of the survival rate of systemic interventions for psoriasis treatment. Patients with psoriasis who visited 20 facilities in the Western Japan area between January 2019 and May 2020 and gave written consent were registered as study participants, and their medical history of systemic interventions for psoriasis (starting from 2010) was retrospectively collected and analyzed. The drugs investigated were adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, risankizumab, cyclosporine, and apremilast. When drugs were discontinued, the reasons were also recorded. A total of 1003 patients with psoriasis including 268 with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) were enrolled. In biologics, more recently released drugs such as interleukin 17 inhibitors showed a numerically higher survival rate in the overall (post-2010) analysis. However, in the subset of patients who began treatment after 2017, the difference in the survival rate among the drugs was smaller. The reasons for discontinuing drugs varied, but a loss of efficacy against dermatological or joint symptoms were relatively frequently seen with some biologics and cyclosporine. The stratification of drug survival rates based on patient characteristics such as bio-naive or experienced, normal weight or obese, and with or without PsA, revealed that bio-experienced, obese, and PsA groups had poorer survival rates for most drugs. No notable safety issues were identified in this study. Overall, the present study revealed that the biologics show differences in their tendency to develop a loss of efficacy, and the factors that negatively impact the survival rate of biologics include the previous use of biologics, obesity, and PsA.",0
Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Absorbable and Nonabsorbable Sutures in A1 Pulley Release.,"BACKGROUND: Both absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures are used to correct palmar incisions or lacerations. Nonabsorbable sutures have been used without complications but require removal at a follow-up appointment. Alternatively, the use of absorbable sutures has increased in popularity as postoperative suture removal is not required but is associated with local immunological and inflammatory responses. In this study, we compared the scar quality and outcomes of nonabsorbable and absorbable sutures in A1 pulley release. METHODS: Patients who underwent A1 pulley release were randomized to 1 of 2 suture materials. The Patient Scar Assessment Scale, Observer Scar Assessment Scale, Visual Analogue Scale, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores were collected at 2, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Among the 41 patients included in the study, 23 were randomized to the nonabsorbable suture group, and 18 to the absorbable suture group. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the two suture groups in the aforementioned assessments. Complication rates were higher in the nonabsorbable suture group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Notably, 1 case in the absorbable suture group had uncontrolled postoperative bleeding and required reoperation. CONCLUSION: We found no significant difference between the two materials in terms of the Patient or Observer Scar Assessment Scales, overall complication rates, symptom scores, or pain scores. Therefore, the choice using absorbable or nonabsorbable can be guided by other factors such as physician or patient preference, availability, and cost.",0
Patient preferences for operative versus nonoperative treatment of LC1 pelvis fracture: a discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify how patients with LC1 pelvis fracture value attributes of operative versus nonoperative treatment. METHODS: Design: Discrete choice experiment. SETTING: 3 US Level 1 trauma centers. PATIENT SELECTION CRITERIA: Adult survivors of an LC1 pelvis treated between June 2016 through March 2023 were identified from institutional registries. The choice experiment was administered as a survey from March through August 2023. OUTCOME MEASURES AND COMPARISONS: Participants chose between 12 hypothetical comparisons of treatment attributes including operative or nonoperative care, risk of death, severity of pain, risk of secondary surgery, shorter hospital stay, discharge destination, and independence in ambulation within one month of injury. The marginal utility of each treatment attribute, e.g. the strength of participants' aggregate preference for an attribute as indicated by their survey choices, was estimated by multinomial logit modeling with and without stratification by treatment received. RESULTS: 449 eligible patients were identified. The survey was distributed to 182 patients and collected from 72 (39%) patients at a median 2.3 years after injury. Respondents were 66% female with a median age of 59 years (IQR 34-69). Before injury, 94% ambulated independently and 75% were working. 41% received operative treatment. Independence with ambulation provided the highest relative marginal utility (21%, p<0.001), followed by discharge to home versus skilled nursing (20%, p<0.001), moderate versus severe post-discharge pain (17%, p<0.001), shorter hospital stay (16%, p<0.001), secondary surgery (15%, p<0.001), mortality (10%, p=0.02). Overall, no relative utility for operative versus nonoperative treatment was observed (2%, p=0.54). However, respondents strongly preferred the treatment they received: operative patients valued operative treatment (utility, 0.37 vs. -0.37, p<0.001); nonoperative patients valued nonoperative treatment (utility, 0.19 vs. -0.19, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: LC1 pelvis fracture patients valued independence with ambulation, shorter hospital stay, and avoiding secondary surgery and mortality in the month after their injury. Patients preferred the treatment they received rather than operative versus nonoperative care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.",1
Interscalene block vs. periarticular liposomal bupivacaine for pain control following reverse shoulder arthroplasty: a randomized trial.,"BACKGROUND: Interscalene nerve blocks and local anesthetic infiltration are 2 methods commonly used in multimodal analgesia regimens for shoulder arthroplasty. Liposomal bupivacaine is a novel anesthetic that can be detected more than 24 hours following local administration. Studies comparing liposomal bupivacaine with conventional analgesic methods have found mixed results regarding pain and narcotic consumption, and there is little information available regarding patient satisfaction and the role of psychosocial variables. METHODS: This is a randomized study of 76 adult patients undergoing reverse shoulder arthroplasty who were assigned to receive a preoperative interscalene nerve block with ropivacaine (Block = 38) or an intraoperative periarticular injection of liposomal bupivacaine (Local = 38). The primary outcomes were narcotic consumption (MEq, morphine equivalents), visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, and satisfaction (0-10). The secondary outcomes were the effect of patient group preference (Block vs. Local) and psychosocial variables (Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Brief Resilience Scale) on satisfaction. Length of stay, pain-related phone calls, pain-related readmissions, and the number of narcotic refills were tracked from the day of surgery through the first postoperative appointment, which was routinely 7-14 days following surgery. RESULTS: Intraoperative and day 0 narcotic consumption was lower in the Block group by 17.3 and 21.6 MEq (P < .001, P = .035) with no differences on day 1 or 2. There was no difference in VAS pain scores, length of stay, pain-related phone calls, pain-related readmissions, or the number of narcotic refills. Patient satisfaction was higher in the Block group (8.3 vs. 6.8, P = .017). Pain catastrophizing, resilience, and patient group preference did not have any significant relationship with patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing reverse shoulder arthroplasty have higher satisfaction with a conventional interscalene block compared to a periarticular injection of liposomal bupivacaine. There were no clinically important differences in narcotic consumption, VAS pain scores, length of stay, pain-related phone calls, pain-related readmissions, or the number of narcotic refills. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Brief Resilience Scale, and patient preferences did not have any relationship with patient satisfaction.",0
'Ease of adaptation' predicts preferred spectacle prescriptions better than visual acuity: a retrospective analysis.,"CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Factors predicting patient acceptance of a new spectacle prescription need to be determined to make optimal prescribing decisions. BACKGROUND: Clinicians usually prescribe for best visual acuity. However, for some patients, a partial change is prescribed to ease adaptation, despite providing suboptimal visual acuity. This study seeks to develop an understanding of which factors predict patient preference between spectacle prescriptions by using a retrospective analysis to compare ease of adaptation, subjective quality of distance vision and optimal distance visual acuity. METHODS: A retrospective analysis utilised a 196-patient data set in which participants wore two prescriptions, one based on the subjective refraction of an optometrist modified by judgement and one on autorefractor results modified for ease of adaptation by an algorithm. Spectacles were worn for 3 weeks each, and participants responded to questions about which prescription they preferred and their quality of distance vision and ease of adaptation (on a 0-10 scale) with each prescription. A logistic regression analysed which variables predicted whether participants responded yes or no to the question 'If you had purchased these spectacles for $100 (US$200 adjusted to 2023 value), would you be happy with them?' RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the preferred and non-preferred prescriptions for the subjective quality of distance vision rating (medians 9 vs. 8; Z = -7.80, p < 0.0001) and ease of adaptation rating (medians 8 vs. 5; Z = -8.32, p < 0.0001) but the distance binocular visual acuity was not significantly different (both means = -0.09 logMAR; Z = -0.60, p = 0.55). Of all participants, 94% preferred the prescription deemed easier to adapt to but only 59% preferred the prescription with better subjective quality of distance vision and best visual acuity. CONCLUSION: Distance visual acuity was not found to be a useful predictor of participant preference to a new prescription and is likely over-relied upon in practice. The results support the adjustment of the subjective prescription where appropriate to aid patient adaptation and comfort.",0
Preferences for accessing sexual health services among middle-aged and older adults in the UK: a study protocol for a discrete choice experiment using mixed methods.,"INTRODUCTION: Sexual health is essential for general health and well-being. Sexual health services for middle-aged and older adults are not prioritised and optimising available services for this population is often overlooked. Not much is known about preferences for accessing sexual health services among middle-aged and older people or level of satisfaction with current services. The aim of this study is to explore preferences for seeking sexual health services among middle-aged and older adults in the UK. This study will use discrete choice experiments (DCEs) including initial qualitative interviews followed by the survey, which have been used as a tool to explore preferences in various health service delivery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The project will be carried out in two phases. First, we will conduct in-depth semi-structured interviews with 20-30 adults (aged 45+), including disabled people, and those from sexual minority groups resident in the UK. Interviews will explore indications, preferences and factors related to accessing sexual health services. Themes and subthemes emerging from the analysis of the interviews will then be used to design the choice sets and attribute level for the DCEs. For the second phase, for the DCEs, we will design choice sets composed of sexual health service delivery scenarios. The software Ngene will be used to develop the experimental design matrix for the DCE. We will use descriptive statistics to summarise the key sociodemographic characteristics of the study population. Multinomial logit, latent class and mixed logit models will be explored to assess sexual health service preferences and preference heterogeneity. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for both parts of this study was granted by the Research and Ethics Committee at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Findings from this study will be disseminated widely to relevant stakeholders via scheduled meetings, webinars, presentations and journal publications.",1
Preferences of women in difficult life situations for a physical activity programme: protocol of a discrete choice experiment in the German NU-BIG project.,"INTRODUCTION: The BIG project ('Bewegung als Investition in die Gesundheit', ie, 'Movement as Investment in Health') was developed in 2005 as a community-based participatory research programme to offer accessible opportunities for physical activity to women in difficult life situations. Since then, the programme has been expanded to eight sites in Germany. A systematic evaluation of BIG is currently being conducted. As part of this effort, we strive to understand the preferences of participating women for different aspects of the programme, and to analyse their willingness to pay. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this protocol, we describe the development and analysis plan of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to investigate participants' preferences for a physical activity programme for women in difficult life situations. The experiment will be embedded in a questionnaire covering several aspects of participation in the programme (eg, reach, efficacy and further effects) and the socioeconomic characteristics of all active participants. After a thorough search of the literature, BIG documents review and expert interviews, we identified five important attributes of the programme: course times, travel time to the course venue, additional social activities organised by BIG, consideration of wishes and interests for the further planning of courses and costs per course unit. Thereafter, we piloted the experiment with a sample of participants from the target group. After data collection, the experiment will be analysed using a conditional logit model and a latent class analysis to assess eventual heterogeneity in preferences. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Understanding women's preferences will provide useful insights for the further development of the programme and ultimately increase participation and retention. The questionnaire, the included DCE and the pretest on participants received ethical approval (application no. 20-247_1-B). We plan to disseminate the results of the DCE in peer-reviewed journals, national conferences and among participants and programme coordinators and organisers.",1
How surgeons use risk calculators and non-clinical factors for informed consent and shared decision making: A qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: The discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery with patients is a defining component of informed consent. As shared-decision making has become central to surgeon-patient communication, risk calculators have emerged as a tool to aid communication and decision-making. To optimize informed consent, it is necessary to understand how surgeons assess and communicate risk, and the role of risk calculators in this process. METHODS: We conducted interviews with 13 surgeons from two institutions to understand how surgeons assess risk, the role of risk calculators in decision-making, and how surgeons approach risk communication during informed consent. We performed a qualitative analysis of interviews based on SRQR guidelines. RESULTS: Our analysis yielded insights regarding (a) the landscape and approach to obtaining surgical consent; (b) detailed perceptions regarding the value and design of assessing and communicating risk; and (c) practical considerations regarding the future of personalized risk communication in decision-making. Above all, we found that non-clinical factors such as health and risk literacy are changing how surgeons assess and communicate risk, which diverges from traditional risk calculators. CONCLUSION: Principally, we found that surgeons incorporate a range of clinical and non-clinical factors to risk stratify patients and determine how to optimally frame and discuss risk with individual patients. We observed that surgeons' perception of risk communication, and the importance of eliciting patient preferences to direct shared-decision making, did not consistently align with patient priorities. This study underscored criticisms of risk calculators and novel decision-aids - which must be addressed prior to greater adoption.",0
Genetic counseling and testing for females at elevated risk for breast cancer: Protocol for the randomized controlled trial of the Know Your Risk intervention.,"BACKGROUND: Genetic counseling and testing have an important role in the care of patients at elevated risk for breast cancer. However, conventional pre- and post-test genetic counseling is labor and time intensive, less accessible for patients living outside major urban centers, and impractical on a large scale. A patient-driven approach to genetic counseling and testing may increase access, improve patients' experiences, affect efficiency of clinical practice, and help meet workforce demand. The objective of this 2-arm randomized controlled trial is to determine the efficacy of Know Your Risk (KYR), a genetic counseling patient preference intervention. METHODS: Females (n = 1000) at elevated risk (>20% lifetime) for breast cancer will be randomized to the KYR intervention or conventional genetic counseling. The study will provide comprehensive assessment of breast cancer risk by multigene panel testing and validated polygenic risk score. Primary outcome is adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for a clinical encounter every 6-12 months and an annual mammogram (breast MRI if recommended) determined by medical record review. Secondary outcomes include adherence to other recommended cancer screening tests determined by medical record review and changes in breast cancer knowledge, perception of risk, post-test/counseling distress, and satisfaction with counseling by completion of three surveys during the study. Study aims will be evaluated for non-inferiority of the KYR intervention compared to conventional genetic counseling. CONCLUSION: If efficacious, the KYR intervention has the potential to improve patients' experience and may change how genetic counseling is delivered, inform best practices, and reduce workforce burden.

Combining Gluteal Shaping with High-Definition Liposuction: New Concepts and Techniques.,"Gluteal contouring has been subject to numerous publications in aesthetic plastic surgery. Not only the female but also the male features that govern such procedures have been thoroughly described by different authors. In this article, we will provide the reader with an updated account of how gluteal contouring blends with High Definition Liposculpture (HDL). We discuss the most current techniques for buttocks reshaping through a holistic approach of new anatomical and artistic concepts. We will dive into new techniques to perform multiplanar and 4-dimensional Fat Grafting and equalization of the buttocks and surrounding areas, which we believe might help plastic surgeons to improve the quality of their patient outcomes. In effect, a proper understanding of the anatomical structures and its variations among different gender and ethnicities, will both help the surgeon to individualize the procedure based on patient preferences.",0
Design and Material Characterization of an Inflatable Vaginal Dilator.,"There are more than 13,000 new cases of cervical cancer each year in the United States and approximately 245,000 survivors. External beam radiation and brachytherapy are the front-line treatment modalities, and 60% of patients develop vaginal damage and constriction, i.e., stenosis of the vaginal vault, greatly impeding sexual function. The incidence of vaginal stenosis (VS) following radiotherapy (RT) for anorectal cancer is 80%. VS causes serious quality of life (QoL) and psychological issues, and while standard treatment using self-administered plastic dilators is effective, acceptance and compliance are often insufficient. Based on published patient preferences, we have pursued the design of a soft inflatable dilator for treating radiotherapy-induced vaginal stenosis (VS). The critical component of the novel device is the dilator balloon wall material, which must be compliant yet able to exert therapeutic lateral force levels. We selected a commercially available silicone elastomer and characterized its stress-strain characteristics and hyperelastic properties. These parameters were quantified using uniaxial tensile testing and digital image correlation (DIC). Dilator inflation versus internal pressure was modeled and experimentally validated in order to characterize design parameters, particularly the dilator wall thickness. Our data suggest that an inflatable silicone elastomer-based vaginal dilator warrants further development in the context of a commercially available, well-tolerated, and effective device for the graded, controlled clinical management of radiotherapy-induced VS.",0
Colposcopy in the Primary Health Care: A Scoping Review.,"AIM: Low- and middle-income countries represent nearly 85% of all cervical cancer cases worldwide; thereby, it is extremely important to identify methods to improve the screening process. Therefore, this study aimed to summarize the primary characteristics of studies on accessibility, coverage, patient preferences, and factors associated with patient satisfaction or acceptance of colposcopy in primary healthcare. METHODS: A search strategy, based on MeSH, Emtree, and free terms, was run through 5 databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Ovid/Medline, and Web of Science). EndNote 20.1 © and Rayyan QCRI © were used for screening. A preset datasheet was used for data extraction. RESULTS: The systematic search retrieved 1127 references, and after removing duplicates, screening the titles and abstracts, and reviewing the full text, 7 studies were included. The interrater reliability was 77.73% (kappa statistic = 0.1842). Most studies estimated the proportion of women that sought for colposcopy after a previous screening test for human papilloma virus. One study identifies barriers to colposcopy examination in women at risk of developing cervical cancer. Three studies assessed the decentralization of colposcopy from a tertiary healthcare center to a primary care center. Pap smear was the most common first-line screening test, followed by liquid-based cytology sample and visual inspection with acetic acid. CONCLUSION: Only a few countries have investigated the use of colposcopy in primary care. Thus, barriers and the care structure for this implementation to be successful in reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality should be identified.",0
Patient Perception of Physician Attire Before and After the COVID-19 Global Pandemic Began.,"Introduction: This study evaluated patient preference of physician attire both before and after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic began. The primary outcome was patient preference of physician attire in 2017 compared to 2022 survey cohorts. Methods: An observational cross-sectional study performed at a single-site academic institution in the United States using patient survey materials. In total, 339 patients were included in the study, 161 from 2017 and 178 from 2022. Key Points: There was a statistically significant decrease in patient preference for formal attire in the clinical settings of primary care, hospital, and overall. Male patient preference for formal attire declined in primary care, emergency room, and overall; whereas female patient preference for formal attire declined in the hospital setting. For all genders, the odds ratio was statistically significantly lower in the settings of primary care clinic, hospital, and overall clinical settings. Conclusions: Patient preference for physicians wearing formal attire has decreased significantly since the COVID-19 global pandemic began.",0
Sentiment analysis of pain physician reviews on Healthgrades: a physician review website.,"INTRODUCTION: There are currently no published studies using patient reviews of pain physicians to quantitatively assess patient preferences for pain physician attributes. The aim of the present study was to use natural language processing to quantitatively analyze patient reviews of pain physicians by determining the effect of physician demographics and word frequency on positive review outcomes. METHODS: Using a peer-reviewed algorithm, online Healthgrades reviews of pain physicians practicing in the USA were scored according to their positive sentiment from -1 to 1. These sentiment scores and star ratings were used to compare physicians by age, gender and region of practice. Frequency analysis of words and bigrams was performed for all reviews. RESULTS: There were 15 101 reviews collected among 1275 pain physicians which showed male physicians received higher star ratings and review sentiment scores than female physicians. Pain physicians younger than 55 years received higher star ratings and sentiment scores than those of 55 years and older. Frequency analysis revealed that words most commonly used in the more positive patient reviews included 'care', 'professional', 'patient', 'help' and 'kind'; the words most commonly used in less positive reviews included 'pain', 'back', 'office', 'time' and 'years'. CONCLUSIONS: Male and/or younger pain physicians receive more positive reviews. Patients highly rate pain physicians who are perceived as personable. Patients lowly rate physicians who are perceived as providing ineffective treatment of their pain as well as when they experience barriers to their access to care.",0
Squamous Cell Carcinoma in Situ of the Nail Unit: Current Evidence and Recommendations for Patient Centered Treatment.,"Squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the hand and nail is an infrequent tumor but represents the majority of hand and nail malignancies. While the conventional treatments of invasive nail unit squamous cell carcinoma include Mohs micrographic surgery, wide local excision, or distal digit amputation, no standardized management paradigm for in situ disease exists and the necessity of surgical options is debated. This review aims to discuss the most commonly reported treatment methods and critically assess relevant management considerations in order to facilitate appropriate treatment decisions for nail unit SCCis across dermatologic practice settings. Assessment of the current literature reveals insufficient evidence to determine a standardized treatment for nail unit squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Rather, management is greatly impacted by multiple factors including the presence of subungual involvement, surgical candidacy, importance of curative treatment, and patient preferences regarding cosmesis and function versus cure. When cure is desired, Mohs micrographic surgery is the treatment of choice in most cases. In the setting of desired curative intent, but poor surgical candidacy, radiotherapy may be effective and provide a reasonable chance of functional and cosmetic preservation. Other methods including photodynamic therapy, electrodesiccation and curettage, cryotherapy, and intralesional chemotherapeutics may be appropriate in specific circumstances, but are generally limited by lack of evidence or impracticalities. Lastly, observation with palliation may be appropriate when considering exceedingly rare disease-related mortality.",0
Shared Decision-Making in Allergen Immunotherapy (AIT) Options Using a Questionnaire for Respiratory Allergic Patients: A Delphi Consensus Study.,"PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to develop and validate a questionnaire, through a Delphi consensus, to be used by allergists in their routine clinical practice to assess the preferences of patients starting allergen immunotherapy (AIT) treatment using an objective approach. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Delphi consensus-driven process was used. The scientific committee, composed of 15 allergists, led the study and participated in the preparation of the questionnaire. Two-hundred panelists from different Spanish regions were invited to complete a 16-item questionnaire on a nine-point Likert scale covering six topic blocks. Consensus was achieved if ≥66.6% of panelists reached agreement or disagreement. RESULTS: Of the 200 experts invited to participate in the Delphi process, a total of 195 (97.5%) answered the questionnaire. The panel experts reached a consensus on ""agreement"" on a total of 12 of the 16 (75.0%) items, covering a total of six categories: (a) patient knowledge (2 questions), (b) barriers to patient adherence (3 questions), (c) patient behavior (4 questions), (d) future actions (3 questions), (e) treatment costs (2 questions), and (f) final patient preferences (2 questions). CONCLUSION: This Delphi consensus study validated a set of twelve recommended questions for patients objectively assessing their preferences and suitability for the most common AIT options available. The questionnaire intends to assist allergists in making an objective, unconditioned decision regarding the best AIT option for each patient, after informing them about the different routes.",0
Patients preferences for communication during video consultations.,"Objective The aim of our simulation-based study was to explore patient preferences for physician behaviours in video consultations METHODS: We conducted an exploratory study in outpatient setting in Geneva, Switzerland.Patients were invited to watch two variations videos of six simulated physician communication behaviours (camera framing, gaze orientation, initial talk at the opening phase, privacy reminder, pauses, empathy)and to indicate which one they preferred RESULTS: 417 patients watched three different video-recorded encounters. Most patients preferred framing with both face and bust (50.7 %) versus face alone (21.8 %). They valued eye gazing towards the camera (42.9 %) versus eye gazing shifting between screen and camera (13 %). The social talk related to the connection quality was appreciated (43.1 % vs 17.1 %) as well as the privacy reminder (80.8 % vs 6.5 %). Patients preferred short rather than long pauses after physician's statements (63.9 vs 14.9 %) as well as expressive rather than neutral nonverbal behaviour (46.7 % vs 17.6 %). CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that patients prefer the use of video specific communication behaviours recommended by experts except for shifting eye gaze and long pauses after physician's statements. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Given the increasing use of video consultations, video communication ""best practices""should be systematically addressed in physician training.",0
The Evolving Treatment Landscape of Merkel Cell Carcinoma.,"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) has a high risk of recurrence and requires unique treatment relative to other skin cancers. The patient population is generally older, with comorbidities. Multidisciplinary and personalized care is therefore paramount, based on patient preferences regarding risks and benefits. Positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) is the most sensitive staging modality and reveals clinically occult disease in ~ 16% of patients. Discovery of occult disease spread markedly alters management. Newly diagnosed, localized disease is often managed with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), local excision, primary wound closure, and post-operative radiation therapy (PORT). In contrast, metastatic disease is usually treated systemically with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). However, one or more of these approaches may not be indicated. Criteria for such exceptions and alternative approaches will be discussed. Because MCC recurs in 40% of patients and early detection/treatment of advanced disease is advantageous, close surveillance is recommended. Given that over 90% of initial recurrences arise within 3 years, surveillance frequency can be rapidly decreased after this high-risk period. Patient-specific assessment of risk is important because recurrence risk varies widely (15 to > 80%: Merkelcell.org/recur) depending on baseline patient characteristics and time since treatment. Blood-based surveillance tests are now available (Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) antibodies and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)) with excellent sensitivity that can spare patients from contrast dye, radioactivity, and travel to a cancer imaging facility. If recurrent disease is locoregional, management with surgery and/or RT is typically indicated. ICIs are now the first line for systemic/advanced MCC, with objective response rates (ORRs) exceeding 50%. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is sometimes used for debulking disease or in patients who cannot tolerate ICI. ICI-refractory disease is the major problem faced by this field. Fortunately, numerous promising therapies are on the horizon to address this clinical need.",0
Current Practices and Challenges When Submitting Patient Experience Data for Regulatory Decisions by the US Food and Drug Administration: An Industry Survey.,"OBJECTIVES: To understand industry practices and challenges when submitting patient experience data (PED) for regulatory decisions by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). METHODS: A two-part online survey related to collection, submission, and use of PED by FDA in regulatory decision-making (part 1) and a best-worst exercise for prioritizing potential PED initiatives (part 2) was completed by industry and contract research organization (CRO) members with ≥ 2 years of recent experience with patient-reported outcome (PRO), natural history study (NHS), or patient preference (PP) data; and direct experience with FDA filings including PED. RESULTS: A total of 50 eligible respondents (84% industry) completed part 1 of the survey, among which 46 completed part 2. Respondents mostly had PRO (86%) and PP (50%) experience. All indicated that FDA meetings should have a standing agenda item to discuss PED. Most (78%) reported meetings should occur before pivotal trials. A common challenge was justifying inclusion without knowing if and how data will be used. Most agreed that FDA and industry should co-develop the PED table in the FDA clinical review (74%), and the table should report reason(s) for not using PED (96%) in regulatory decision-making. Most important efforts to advance PED use in decision-making were a dedicated meeting pathway and expanded FDA guidance (51% each). CONCLUSIONS: FDA has policy targets expanding PED use, but challenges remain regarding pathways for PED submission and transparency in regulatory decision-making. Alignment on the use of existing meeting opportunities to discuss PED, co-development of the PED table, and expanded guidance are encouraged.",1
The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of outpatient clinic services in East Jerusalem hospitals: patients' perspectives.,"BACKGROUND: Due to the decreased availability, accessibility, and quality of services, the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the healthcare system. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients' perceptions of healthcare have changed, and out-patient visits to clinics have decreased. As part of the COVID-19 outbreak in East Jerusalem, this study aims to assess how patients perceive the way that outpatient clinic services were delivered before and during COVID-19 outbreak. METHODOLOGY: Convenience sampling and self-reported questionnaires were used in a cross-sectional study. Three hundred people from three significant outpatient clinic hospitals in East Jerusalem-Al-Makassed Hospital, Augusta Victoria Hospital, and Sant-Joseph Hospital- made up the sample. Multivariate tests, frequencies, and percentages were used in the statistical analysis. RESULTS: The results showed that the most of the participants (98.6%) had negative opinion when the current situation is compared with before the COVID-19 period in terms of accessibility, availability of resources, quality of care, attitudes and patient's preference. Finally, multivariate analysis indicated a significant relationship between participant opinion and education level and participants with educational levels of 12 study years or less had more positive opinions of the delivery of the healthcare system during the COVID-19 outbreak period than the group with more than 12 study years. Also, the multivariate analysis revealed a significant `relationship between participant opinion and the duration of the illness as those with years of illness and less had more negative opinion toward the delivery of the healthcare system than those with more than 3 years of illness. CONCLUSION: This study found that when the current situation during the COVID-19 outbreak is compared to before the COVID-19 period in terms of accessibility, availability of resources, quality of care, attitudes, and patient preferences, the majority of the participants with chronic diseases or cancer had a negative opinion. Policymakers and health managers should enhance patient preferences and attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic and other pandemics by increasing accessibility, availability of health resources, and the quality of healthcare.",0
Understanding Treatment Preferences for Patients with Tricuspid Regurgitation.,"Background. Tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a high-prevalence disease associated with poor quality of life and mortality. This quantitative patient preference study aims to identify TR patients' perspectives on risk-benefit tradeoffs. Methods. A discrete-choice experiment was developed to explore TR treatment risk-benefit tradeoffs. Attributes (levels) tested were treatment (procedure, medical management), reintervention risk (0%, 1%, 5%, 10%), medications over 2 y (none, reduce, same, increase), shortness of breath (none/mild, moderate, severe), and swelling (never, 3× per week, daily). A mixed logit regression model estimated preferences and calculated predicted probabilities. Relative attribute importance was calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed. Results. An online survey was completed by 150 TR patients. Shortness of breath was the most important attribute and accounted for 65.8% of treatment decision making. The average patients' predicted probability of preferring a ""procedure-like"" profile over a ""medical management-like"" profile was 99.7%. This decreased to 78.9% for a level change from severe to moderate in shortness of breath in the ""medical management-like"" profile. Subgroup analysis confirmed that patients older than 64 y had a stronger preference to avoid severe shortness of breath compared with younger patients (P < 0.02), as did severe or worse TR patients relative to moderate. New York Heart Association class I/II patients more strongly preferred to avoid procedural reintervention risk relative to class III/IV patients (P < 0.03). Conclusion. TR patients are willing to accept higher procedural reintervention risk if shortness of breath is alleviated. This risk tolerance is higher for older and more symptomatic patients. These results emphasize the appropriateness of developing TR therapies and the importance of addressing symptom burden. HIGHLIGHTS: This study provides quantitative patient preference data from clinically confirmed tricuspid regurgitation (TR) patients to understand their treatment preferences.Using a targeted literature search and patient, physician, and Food and Drug Administration feedback, a cross-sectional survey with a discrete-choice experiment that focused on 5 of the most important attributes to TR patients was developed and administered online.TR patients are willing to accept higher procedural reintervention risk if shortness of breath is alleviated, and this risk tolerance is higher for older and more symptomatic patients.",1
The Effects of Changing Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Devices in Japanese Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Case Series.,"Objective The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in Japanese patients have not been reported. We assessed the effects of changing CPAP devices (from the Philips Respironics device to the ResMed device) on the control of OSA. Methods We retrospectively examined 13 patients with OSA who voluntarily changed from the Philips Respironics device to the ResMed device due to a Philips Respironics CPAP device recall. Data on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) were obtained from the CPAP devices for three months before and after changing the devices. Results The AHI obtained from the CPAP devices significantly decreased from 4.4 (3.1-10.7) events/h to 2.0 (0.8-3.6) events/h when patients changed devices (p=0.022). The AHI decreased to <5 events/h after changing devices in 4 patients, whereas it had been ≥5 events/h before changing devices in 6 patients. Conclusion Changing CPAP devices can decrease the AHI.",0
Cardiac rehabilitation for heart failure: 'Cinderella' or evidence-based pillar of care?,"Cardiac rehabilitation remains the 'Cinderella' of treatments for heart failure. This state-of-the-art review provides a contemporary update on the evidence base, clinical guidance, and status of cardiac rehabilitation delivery for patients with heart failure. Given that cardiac rehabilitation participation results in important improvements in patient outcomes, including health-related quality of life, this review argues that an exercise-based rehabilitation is a key pillar of heart failure management alongside drug and medical device provision. To drive future improvements in access and uptake, health services should offer heart failure patients a choice of evidence-based modes of rehabilitation delivery, including home, supported by digital technology, alongside traditional centre-based programmes (or combinations of modes, 'hybrid') and according to stage of disease and patient preference.",0
Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to personalise follow-up care of ovarian cancer: what do patients think? A qualitative interview study.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore ovarian cancer patients' preferences regarding follow-up care and, in particular, the use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) as an approach to personalise follow-up care. METHODS: Between May and June 2021, semi-structured interviews were conducted with ovarian cancer patients, who had finished their primary treatment at least 6 months prior and were receiving follow-up care at our centre. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using an inductive thematic approach. A thematic flow chart was created describing interacting themes. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were interviewed, of which 11 were familiar with PROMs. Two key themes emerged from the data: the need for reassurance and the wish for personalised care. A follow-up scheme using PROMs was identified as a separate theme with the potential to personalise care. Several barriers and facilitators of PROMs were mentioned. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian cancer patients have a desire for personalised follow-up care and seek reassurance. PROMs may be able to support both of these needs. Future research is needed to determine the most effective, patient-centred way to implement them. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: By understanding what patients' preferences are regarding follow-up care, more initiatives can be set up to personalise follow-up care, through which patient anxiety and dissatisfaction can be reduced.",0
Etanercept is Effective and Halts Radiographic Progression in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis: Final Results from a German Non-interventional Study (PRERA).,"INTRODUCTION: Etanercept (ETN) has been shown to slow radiographic progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in clinical trials. This real-world, non-interventional study assessed radiographic progression in patients with RA or PsA treated with ETN for ≤ 36 months in outpatient care in Germany (NCT01623752). METHODS: Patients with RA or PsA attended ≤ 10 visits across two study phases (phase 1: seven visits, baseline to month 18; phase 2: three visits until month 36). Radiographs were taken at baseline (Rx1), months 12-18 (Rx2), and/or months 30-36 (Rx3). Historic radiographs (Rx0) taken 12-48 months pre-baseline were also evaluated (if available). The primary endpoint was the change in modified total Sharp score (mTSS). The erosion score (ES) and joint space narrowing score (JSN) were also evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 1821 patients were enrolled (RA: n = 1378; PsA: n = 440). In patients with Rx1 and Rx2 (RA: n = 511; PsA: n = 167), the mean mTSS remained stable for both disease groups, and the annualized median change in mTSS was 0. In patients with Rx0, Rx1, and Rx2 (RA: n = 180; PsA: n = 47), annualized radiographic progression in mTSS, ES, and JSN was larger in the pre-ETN treatment phase than during ETN treatment in both disease groups. The percentage of patients with radiographic non-progression was higher during ETN treatment versus pre-ETN. Improvement in clinical disease activity and patient-reported outcomes was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first real-world, non-interventional study to report systematically collected radiographic data in a large cohort of patients with RA or PsA under treatment with a biologic. In patients with available radiographic data, mean radiographic progression was lower and the proportion of patients without progression was greater during ETN treatment than in the pre-ETN period.",0
"Real-World Use of Albutrepenonacog Alfa, A Recombinant Coagulation Factor IX Albumin Fusion Protein, for Personalized Prophylaxis in Japanese Individuals With Hemophilia B: A Case Series.","Currently, the mainstay of disease management for hemophilia B, a hemorrhagic disease caused by a congenital deficiency or molecular abnormalities of blood coagulation factor IX (FIX), is prophylaxis using FIX concentrate. On-demand injections of FIX concentrate may also be required, even during prophylaxis, when a patient with hemophilia B is bleeding. Albutrepenonacog alfa (rFIX-FP) is a human albumin fusion gene recombinant FIX, which is administered once every seven, 14, or 21 days, depending on patient preferences and symptoms. Studies have demonstrated its efficacy and safety in a range of patients; however, to date, reports of real-world experiences of the use of rFIX-FP in Japan are limited. We present a case series of three Japanese individuals with moderately severe (FIX activity 1 to <2%) or severe (FIX activity <1%) hemophilia B who benefited from prophylaxis using rFIX-FP in our clinical practice setting. We highlighted the good effectiveness of rFIX-FP in a patient with moderately severe hemophilia B who required prophylaxis due to joint bleeding, which was causing deterioration of his left ankle joint, as well as in a patient with severe hemophilia B and atherothrombotic cerebral infarction, whose trough level had to be ≥5% for concomitant use of an antiplatelet drug, and in a patient with severe hemophilia B who was working in nursing care, which involved heavy labor and night shifts, and who had previously been treated with on-demand FIX concentrate. In all three cases, rFIX-FP improved disease symptoms, and the patients were able to maintain steady states of therapy due to the treatment characteristics of rFIX-FP, which stabilizes FIX at high trough levels.",0
Growth Modification of Developing Class II Division 1 Malocclusion Using Myofunctional Appliances.,"Background and Overview. Interceptive orthodontics is a phase of orthodontics that identifies and corrects potential malocclusions in the growing dentofacial complex. At this point, myofunctional appliances are a necessary component. A 9-year-old girl appeared with a Class II division 1, a 6 mm overjet, a 6 mm overbite, a V-shaped maxillary arch, as well as lip hypertonicity, and an overdeveloped maxilla. Myobrace® combines the dental alignment abilities of rigid and soft appliances. Its structure replicates a fixed appliance: the soft outer part acts as the orthodontic wire, whereas the inner hard part engages the teeth individually. After 12 months of treatment, facial photos and a cephalogram were taken, both of which demonstrated an enhancement to the patient's facial profile. Conclusions and Practical Implications. This case demonstrates that Myobrace® may be a simple and good choice to treat skeletal malocclusion with oral habit because of its greater compliance and favorable results. In certain instances, an early approach, taking into account patient preferences and compliance, is practical and should be considered in future treatment planning and research.",0
Updates in the Treatment of Non-Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer: The Benefit of Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Antagonists.,"OBJECTIVE: To review pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and considerations for use, of second-generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonists in treatment of nonmetastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (M0CRPC). DATA SOURCES: Conducted search in PubMed and Google scholar (January, 1, 2002-December 31, 2022), using relevant terms. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Relevant English-language studies, conducted in humans evaluating second-generation AR antagonists for M0CRPC, and additional articles and package inserts were considered. DATA SYNTHESIS: Apalutamide, darolutamide, and enzalutamide are effective in delaying the time to development of metastatic prostate cancer in men with M0CRPC with a rapid prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time (<10 months). No head-to-head, randomized, clinical trials have been conducted. The most common adverse effects include fatigue and hypertension, and quality of life is maintained in most patients. Cost is similar among the agents (~$15,000/month). Drug-drug interactions vary among these agents and should be considered, when selecting therapy as well as likely adherence. Darolutamide is administered twice daily with the others once daily. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: Second-generation AR antagonists are effective in reducing time to development of metastatic disease and prolonging overall survival in patients with M0CRPC and a PSA doubling time of <10 months. Recent imaging advances may alter how we evaluate outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Second-generation AR antagonists improve disease control and overall survival. Generally, they are well tolerated and QOL is maintained. Selection of the best agent is based on the adverse effect profile, potential for drug- and disease-interactions, administration, cost, and patient preference.",0
Treatment decision-making among patients with metastatic prostate cancer: Impact of decision locus of control on functional outcomes and decision satisfaction.,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making (SDM) for metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) engages patients in the decision-making process and may be associated with better outcomes relative to physician- or patient-directed decision-making. We assessed the association between decision locus of control (DLOC) and patient-reported quality of life (QOL), functional outcomes, and decision satisfaction among mPC patients. METHODS: After a clinic visit in which a treatment decision was made (baseline), mPC patients completed DLOC and QOL surveys. QOL was re-assessed at 2- and 4-months post-baseline. Mean scores for each QOL dimension (physical, emotional, cognitive, social, and role functioning) were compared by DLOC group using mixed effects models. Patient preferences for DLOC and provider communication techniques were similarly collected via survey. RESULTS: Median age of participants (N = 101) was 69 years (range: 49-92); most were White (80%) and married (82%). 62% reported using SDM. At baseline, there were no differences in QOL dimensions between DLOC groups. At 4 months, patient-directed (p = 0.01) and SDM (p = 0.03) were associated with better physical functioning than physician-directed decision-making, and there was an indication of potentially greater decision satisfaction among patients who reported patient-directed (p = 0.06) or SDM (p = 0.10). SDM was the most reported preferred DLOC. CONCLUSION: mPC patients reporting SDM had better physical functioning at 4 months than physician- or patient-directed decision-making, suggesting measurable benefit from patient involvement in decision-making. Future investigations of these associations in larger, more diverse populations can further clarify these previously unmeasured benefits of patient engagement in treatment decisions.",0
"Patient-Centered Practice Guidelines: GRADEing Evidence to Incorporate Certainty, Balance Between Benefits and Harms, Equity, Feasibility, and Cost-Effectiveness.","The practice of medicine in recent years has emphasized the use of evidence-based clinical guidelines to help inform treatment decisions. Since its development in 2004, the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach has offered a systematic process for reviewing and summarizing the certainty of evidence found in the medical literature regarding various treatment options. To develop truly patient-centered care guidelines, this appraisal of the certainty of evidence must be combined with an understanding of the balance between benefits and harms, patient preferences, equity, feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and policy implications. This review examines each of these domains in detail, exploring the process and benefits of developing relevant, patient-focused guidelines directly applicable to the practice of modern medicine.",0
Sequencing and combination of current small-molecule inhibitors for chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Where is the evidence?,"Small-molecule inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a landscape once dominated by chemoimmunotherapy (i.e., an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody in combination with systemic chemotherapy) in fit and unfit individuals. Key challenges include the management of refractory disease as well as the optimization of the therapy sequence. Decreased responsiveness has been observed with prolonged treatment, especially with Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors which are given continuously, while venetoclax, an agent that targets dysregulations in intrinsic apoptosis signaling, has a fixed duration when combined with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or BTK inhibitors. Combination therapy aims to synergistically target different oncogenic signaling pathways to abrogate the proliferation of resistant clones and thereby allows for fixed-duration treatments. An advantage of fixed-duration therapy is the potential to decrease financial and drug-induced toxicities. Sequencing of therapies is important to individualize treatment decisions based on factors such as age, comorbidities, tolerability, and patient preferences. However, to date, there are limited data to guide the rational sequencing or combination of these therapies, since conventional chemoimmunotherapy or chemotherapy regimens were used as comparators against these small-molecule inhibitors in trials that led to their regulatory approvals. In this article, we examined and evaluated the current evidence for sequencing versus the combination of small-molecule inhibitors for CLL by conducting comprehensive searches of the United States National Library of Medicine PubMed database, key meeting abstracts, and clinical practice guidelines. We also summarized findings from expert opinions to elucidate best practices for clinical scenarios with limited evidence to guide treatment selection.",0
Extended-release Buprenorphine Administered at Discharge in Hospitalized Persons With Opioid Use Disorder: A Case Series.,"INTRODUCTION: Monthly subcutaneous injectable buprenorphine (XR-Bup) is an option for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) that addresses some sublingual buprenorphine adherence barriers and is infrequently offered to hospitalized patients with OUD. METHODS: A retrospective case series was performed for patients receiving XR-Bup upon discharge from 1 academic medical center. Demographic information, diagnoses, follow-up, and documented factors informing the selection of XR-Bup were extracted from the electronic health record. RESULTS: In 1 year, 37 hospitalized patients with OUD received XR-Bup at discharge. The average age was 37.6 years, and patients were primarily Medicaid insured with an injection-related infection. The most common documented factors informing the selection of XR-Bup were as follows: previous sublingual buprenorphine adherence barriers, concurrent stimulant use disorder, and patient preference. Sixty-four percent of patients scheduled for follow-up attended appointments, and 55% received a second dose of XR-Bup. CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous injectable buprenorphine is an option for OUD treatment among hospitalized patients providing 30 or more days of buprenorphine coverage in the postdischarge period.",0
Co-design of an intervention to improve patient participation in discharge medication communication.,"Patients can experience medication-related harm and hospital readmission because they do not understand or adhere to post-hospital medication instructions. Increasing patient medication literacy and, in turn, participation in medication conversations could be a solution. The purposes of this study were to co-design and test an intervention to enhance patient participation in hospital discharge medication communication. In terms of methods, co-design, a collaborative approach where stakeholders design solutions to problems, was used to develop a prototype medication communication intervention. First, our consumer and healthcare professional stakeholders generated intervention ideas. Next, inpatients, opinion leaders, and academic researchers collaborated to determine the most pertinent and feasible intervention ideas. Finally, the prototype intervention was shown to six intended end-users (i.e. hospital patients) who underwent usability interviews and completed the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability questionnaire. The final intervention comprised of a suite of three websites: (i) a medication search engine; (ii) resources to help patients manage their medications once home; and (iii) a question builder tool. The intervention has been tested with intended end-users and results of the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability questionnaire have shown that the intervention is acceptable. Identified usability issues have been addressed. In conclusion, this co-designed intervention provides patients with trustworthy resources that can help them to understand medication information and ask medication-related questions, thus promoting medication literacy and patient participation. In turn, this intervention could enhance patients' medication self-efficacy and healthcare utilization. Using a co-design approach ensured authentic consumer and other stakeholder engagement, while allowing opinion leaders and researchers to ensure that a feasible intervention was developed.",0

The move towards living systematic reviews and living guidelines in healthcare: consideration of the possibilities and challenges for living qualitative evidence syntheses.,"Over the past decade qualitative evidence synthesis (QES), a range of methods for synthesising qualitative research evidence, has become a valued form of evidence for guideline producers who wish to understand more about patient preference and acceptability of treatments. The surge in interest in living systematic reviews and the appearance of living guidelines as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic potentially weaken the value and usability of QES.There are currently no published methods for producing living QES, and if QES are to remain of worth to guideline producers then methods for the rapid, frequent updating of them will need to be developed. We discuss some of the similarities and differences between qualitative and quantitative evidence syntheses and highlight areas where development is needed if reviewers are to progress with living approaches to QES.",0
Nonpharmacologic and Pharmacologic Treatments of Adult Patients With Major Depressive Disorder: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis for a Clinical Guideline by the American College of Physicians.,"BACKGROUND: Primary care patients and clinicians may prefer alternative options to second-generation antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD). PURPOSE: To compare the benefits and harms of nonpharmacologic treatments with second-generation antidepressants as first-step interventions for acute MDD, and to compare second-step treatment strategies for patients who did not achieve remission after an initial attempt with antidepressants. DATA SOURCES: English-language studies from several electronic databases from 1 January 1990 to 8 August 2022, trial registries, gray literature databases, and reference lists to identify unpublished research. STUDY SELECTION: 2 investigators independently selected randomized trials of at least 6 weeks' duration. DATA EXTRACTION: Reviewers abstracted data about study design and conduct, participants, interventions, and outcomes. They dually rated the risk of bias of studies and the certainty of evidence for outcomes of interest. DATA SYNTHESIS: 65 randomized trials met the inclusion criteria; eligible data from nonrandomized studies were not found. Meta-analyses and network meta-analyses indicated similar benefits of most nonpharmacologic treatments and antidepressants as first-step treatments. Antidepressants had higher risks for discontinuation because of adverse events than most other treatments. For second-step therapies, different switching and augmentation strategies provided similar symptomatic relief. The certainty of evidence for most comparisons is low; findings should be interpreted cautiously. LIMITATIONS: Many studies had methodological limitations or dosing inequalities; publication bias might have affected some comparisons. In some cases, conclusions could not be drawn because of insufficient evidence. CONCLUSION: Although benefits seem to be similar among first- and second-step MDD treatments, the certainty of evidence is low for most comparisons. Clinicians and patients should focus on options with the most reliable evidence and take adverse event profiles and patient preferences into consideration.
