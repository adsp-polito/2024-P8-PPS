Discrete Choice Experiments in Health State Valuation: A Systematic Review of Progress and New Trends.,"BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are increasingly used in health state valuation studies. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review updates the progress and new findings of DCE studies in the health state valuation, covering the period since the review of June 2018 to November 2022. The review reports the methods that are currently being used in DCE studies to value health and study design characteristics, and, for the first time, reviews DCE health state valuation studies published in the Chinese language. METHODS: English language databases PubMed and Cochrane, and Chinese language databases Wanfang and CNKI were searched using the self-developed search terms. Health state valuation or methodology study papers were included if the study used DCE data to generate a value set for a preference-based measure. Key information extracted included DCE study design strategies applied, methods for anchoring the latent coefficient on to a 0-1 QALY scale and data analysis methods. RESULTS: Sixty-five studies were included; one Chinese language publication and 64 English language publications. The number of health state valuation studies using DCE has rapidly increased in recent years and these have been conducted in more countries than prior to 2018. Wide usage of DCE with duration attributes, D-efficient design and models accounting for heterogeneity has continued in recent years. Although more methodological consensus has been found than in studies conducted prior to 2018, this consensus may be driven by valuation studies for common measures with an international protocol (the 'model' valuation research). Valuing long measures with well-being attributes attracted attention and more realistic design strategies (e.g., inconstant time preference, efficient design and implausible states design) were identified. However, more qualitative and quantitative methodology study is still necessary to evaluate the effect of those new methods. CONCLUSIONS: The use of DCEs in health state valuation continues to grow dramatically and the methodology progress makes the method more reliable and pragmatic. However, study design is driven by international protocols and method selection is not always justified. There is no gold standard for DCE design, presentation format or anchoring method. More qualitative and quantitative methodology study is recommended to evaluate the effect of new methods before researchers make methodology decisions.",1
"Aortic valve replacement in non-elderly: the gap between reality, guidelines and evidence.","OBJECTIVES: There are several treatment options for non-elderly adults (18-60 years) in need of aortic valve replacement (AVR): a mechanical or biological substitute, a homograft, the Ross procedure or nowadays even transcatheter aortic valve replacement. This study evaluated the current opinions and practices of cardiac surgeons and cardiologists concerning AVR strategies in this patient group. METHODS: A 43-item online survey was sent out to several scientific organizations, individual cardiac surgeons, cardiologists and residents/fellows worldwide. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-two physicians from 33 different countries answered the survey. The UK (24%), Belgium (23%) and North America (22%) are best represented. A mechanical valve is the most frequently used substitute in non-elderly. With increasing patient age, the popularity of a biological valve increases. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement and the Ross procedure are each used in <10% of this cohort. Only 12% of the cardiac surgeons has experience with the Ross surgery. In 23%, the patient seems not to be involved in the decision on the type of valve substitute. CONCLUSIONS: The preferred surgical treatment for non-elderly patients in need of AVR differs widely. To enable a shared decision-making process including patient preferences, there is more need for collaboration between cardiac departments, as well as education and scientific research about patient-centred outcomes of the different AVR techniques.",0
Urological Guidelines for Kidney Stones: Overview and Comprehensive Update.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-based guidelines are published by urological organisations for various conditions, including urolithiasis. In this paper, we provide guidance on the management of kidney stone disease (KSD) and compare the American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urologists (EAU) guidelines. METHODS: We evaluate and appraise the evidence and grade of recommendation provided by the AUA and EAU guidelines on urolithiasis (both surgical and medical management). RESULTS: Both the AUA and EAU guidelines provide guidance on the type of imaging, treatment options, and medical therapies and advice on specific patient groups, such as in paediatrics and pregnancy. While the guidelines are generally aligned and based on evidence, some subtle differences exist in the recommendations, but both are generally unanimous for the majority of the principles of management. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that the guidelines should undergo regular updates based on recently published material, and while these guidelines provide a framework, treatment plans should still be personalised, respecting patient preferences, surgical expertise, and various other individual factors, to offer the best outcome for kidney stone patients.",0
Prosthesis preferences for those with upper limb loss: Discrete choice study of PULLTY® for use in regulatory decisions.,"INTRODUCTION: The patient's voice in shared decision-making has progressed from physician's office to regulatory decision-making for medical devices with FDA's Patient Preference Initiative. A discrete-choice preference measure for upper limb prosthetic devices was developed to investigate patient's risk/benefit preference choices for regulatory decision making. METHODS: Rapid ethnographic procedures were used to design a discrete-choice measure describing risk and benefits of osseointegration with myoelectric control and test in a pilot preference study in adults with upper limb loss. Primary outcome is utility of each choice based conjoint (CBC) attribute using mixed-effects regression. Utilities with and without video, and between genders were compared. RESULTS: Strongest negative preference was for avoiding infection risk (B = -1.77, p < 0.001) and chance of daily pain (B = -1.22, p, 0.001). Strongest positive preference was for attaining complete independence when cooking dinner (B = 1.62, p < 0.001) and smooth grip patterns at all levels (B = 1.62, B = 1.28, B = 1.26, p < 0.001). Trade-offs showed a 1% increase in risk of serious/treatable infection resulted in a 1.77 decrease in relative preference. There were gender differences, and where video was used, preferences were stronger. CONCLUSIONS: Strongest preferences were for attributes of functionality and independence versus connectedness and sensation but showed willingness to make risk-benefit trade-offs. Findings provide valuable information for regulatory benefit-risk decisions for prosthetic device innovations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study is not a clinical trial reporting results of a health care intervention so is not registered.",1
Ablation versus Radiation Segmentectomy for Small Liver Tumors.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a liver malignancy that affects more than a million people worldwide with a complex multifactorial etiology. After the diagnosis of HCC is made, physicians establish management using the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) guidelines revolving around tumor stage, liver function, performance status, and patient preferences. According to recent updates to these guidelines, thermal ablation is the second-best curative option apart from surgical resection for small HCC (< 2 cm). While thermal ablation is standard of care, recent studies have suggested that radiation segmentectomy (RS) has similar outcomes, limited hepatotoxicity, and ultimately a cost-efficient approach. Although there is limited literature on RS, this article compares ablation techniques against radiation segmentectomy for small HCC tumors.",0
Development of a haemophilia A gene therapy shared decision-making tool for clinicians.,"INTRODUCTION: As gene therapies are incorporated into clinical practice, shared decision-making (SDM) is recommended for implementation. AIM: To inform development of a clinician SDM tool for haemophilia A gene therapy. METHODS: Clinicians at US Hemophilia Treatment Centers completed semi-structured interviews about their experience with SDM and provided feedback on a clinician SDM tool prototype. Interviews were transcribed verbatim for coding and thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Ten participants enrolled, eight physicians and two haemophilia nurses. All participants care for adults with haemophilia (1-27 years of experience) and 7 have gene therapy trials open at their institution. Confidence in having a clinical discussion about gene therapy included none (N = 1), slight (N = 3), moderate (N = 5) and high (N = 1). All participants reported familiarity with SDM and agreed that the tool would be useful for their clinical practice. Key themes in participant feedback for the tool were (1) language and presentation; (2) content; and (3) implementation. Participants highlighted the importance of providing unbiased information and having companion tools with patient-centric language. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the need for SDM tools for haemophilia A gene therapy. Key information to include in the tool are safety, efficacy, cost and detailed information on the gene therapy process. Data should be provided in an unbiased format and allow comparison to other treatments. The tool will be evaluated in clinical practice and refined as clinical trial data and real-world experience mature.",0
Literature review and guide for optimal position in implant-based breast reconstruction.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Identification of ideal candidates for prepectoral versus retropectoral implant-based breast reconstruction relies on careful preoperative risk assessment and intraoperative flap evaluation. Few guidelines exist to guide the surgeon's decision-making process when evaluating the preferred plane for implant placement. METHODS: A literature review was performed to develop clinical decision-making algorithms for direct-to-implant (DTI) reconstruction with acellular dermal matrix (ADM) for patients undergoing prophylactic or therapeutic nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) based on patient characteristics, surgical techniques, and outcomes. KEY CONTENT AND FINDINGS: Prepectoral reconstruction is most suitable for patients with small breasts or macromastia with desire for breast reduction, low-grade ptosis, smaller implant sizes, those undergoing PMRT, and for those who aim to mitigate animation deformity and capsular contracture. Retropectoral reconstruction may be recommended for patients with larger breasts with no desire for size change requiring additional prosthesis support, and in patients who aim to reduce likelihood of rippling and need for subsequent fat grafting procedures to address contour abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Careful preoperative and intraoperative assessment of reconstruction options for patients undergoing implant-based breast reconstruction is necessary to mitigate complications and produce superior aesthetic outcomes. Decision algorithms may be used to determine ideal surgical techniques based on patient factors, like radiation history and planning, breast size and ptosis, and patient preferences.",0
Patient-centered care outcomes for patients in the emergency department with a non-English language preference: A scoping review.,"OBJECTIVE: This review highlights what is known about patient-centered care outcomes (PCCOs) for emergency department (ED) patients with non-English language preferences (NELP). METHODS: Four databases were searched and included article were written in English, presented primary evidence, published in a peer-reviewed journal, and reported PCCOs from the perspective of ED patients with NELP. PCCOs were defined using the Institute of Medicine definition, outcomes that evaluate respect and responsiveness to patient preferences, needs and values. Two reviewers assessed all articles, extracted data, and resolved discrepancies. PCCOs were grouped in categories (needs, preferences, and values) based on the definition's domains. RESULTS: Of the 6524 potentially eligible studies, 20 met inclusion criteria. Of these, 16 focused on needs; 4 on preferences and 8 on values. Within patient need, five studies found a large unmet need for language services. Within patient value, three found that language discordance negatively influenced perceptions of care. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies in this review found that not speaking English negatively influenced perceptions of care and highlighted a large unmet need for language services in the ED. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: More work needs to be done to characterize PCCOs in ED patients with NELP and develop interventions to improve care.",0
Attributing practice variation by its sources: the case of varicose veins treatments in the Netherlands.,"BACKGROUND: Unwarranted practice variation refers to regional differences in treatments that are not driven by patients' medical needs or preferences. Although it is the subject of numerous studies, most research focuses on variation at the end stage of treatment, i.e. the stage of the treating specialist, disregarding variation stemming from other sources (e.g. patient preferences, general practitioner referral patterns). In the present paper, we introduce a method that allows us to measure regional variation at different stages of the patient journey leading up to treatment. METHODS: A series of logit regressions estimating the probability of (1) initial visit with the physician and (2) treatment correcting for patient needs and patient preferences. Calculating the coefficient of variation (CVU) at each stage of the patient journey. RESULTS: Our findings show large regional variations in the probability of receiving an initial visit, The CVU, or the measure of dispersion, in the regional probability of an initial visit with a specialist was significantly larger (0.87-0.96) than at the point of treatment both conditional (0.14-0.25) and unconditional on an initial visit (0.65-0.74), suggesting that practice variation was present before the patient reached the specialist. CONCLUSIONS: We present a new approach to attribute practice variation to different stages in the patient journey. We demonstrate our method using the clinically-relevant segment of varicose veins treatments. Our findings demonstrate that irrespective of the gatekeeping role of general practitioners (GPs), a large share of practice variation in the treatment of varicose veins is attributable to regional variation in primary care referrals. Contrary to expectation, specialists' decisions meaningfully diminish rather than increase the amount of regional variation.",0
"""Whatever journey you want to take, I'll support you through"": a mixed methods evaluation of a peer worker program in the hospital emergency department.","BACKGROUND: People who are unhoused, use substances (drugs and/or alcohol), and who have mental health conditions experience barriers to care access and are frequently confronted with discrimination and stigma in health care settings. The role of Peer Workers in addressing these gaps in a hospital-based context is not well characterized. The aim of this evaluation was to 1) outline the role of Peer Workers in the care of a marginalized populations in the emergency department; 2) characterize the impact of Peer Workers on patient care, and 3) to describe how being employed as a Peer Worker impacts the Peer. METHODS: Through a concurrent mixed methods evaluation, we explore the role of Peer Workers in the care of marginalized populations in the emergency department at two urban hospitals in Toronto, Ontario Canada. We describe the demographic characteristics of patients (n = 555) and the type of supports provided to patients collected through a survey between February and June 2022. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were completed with Peer Workers (n = 7). Interviews were thematically analyzed using a deductive approach, complemented by an inductive approach to allow new themes to emerge from the data. RESULTS: Support provided to patients primarily consisted of friendly conversations (91.4%), discharge planning (59.6%), tactics to help the patient navigate their emotions/mental wellbeing (57.8%) and sharing their lived experience (50.1%). In over one third (38.9%) of all patient interactions, Peer Workers shared new information about the patient with the health care team (e.g., obtaining patient identification). Five major themes emerged from our interviews with Peer Workers which include: (1) Establishing empathy and building trust between the patient and their care team through self-disclosure; (2) Facilitating a person-centered approach to patient care through trauma-informed listening and accessible language; (3) Support for patient preferences on harm reduction; (4) Peer worker role facilitating self-acceptance and self-defined recovery; and (5) Importance of supports and resources to help Peer Workers navigate the emotional intensity of the emergency department. CONCLUSIONS: The findings add to the literature on Peer Worker programs and how such interventions are designed to best meet the needs of marginalized populations.",0
Defect-Oriented Versus Back Scar-Oriented Flap Design in Breast Reconstruction with Latissimus Dorsi Musculocutaneous Flap: A Patient-Reported Satisfaction Outcome Comparison Using BREAST-Q.,"BACKGROUND: The design of the latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap in breast reconstruction has several options. To date, there have been no reports on the surgical outcomes with flap designed based on the defect shape of the mastectomy site and flap shape of the donor site. To compare patient satisfaction according to the flap design, we designed and conducted independent three sub-studies targeting fifty-three breast reconstruction patients using BREAST-Q(©) scale. METHODS: In study 1, there was no difference in patient satisfaction between the group with the flap designed according to the shape of mastectomy defect (defect-oriented group) that with the flap designed according to patient's wish regardless of defect shape (back scar-oriented group). In study 2, comparing the results based on the shape of the flap, vertically designed flap showed a statistically significant difference in the psychosocial well-being. In study 3, comparing the results based on the shape of the defect, no significant difference was noted. RESULTS: Even though designing a donor flap based on the shape and orientation of the mastectomy defect has no statistical significance in patient satisfaction or quality of life compared with that based on the patient preference in placement of the donor site scar, the group with the vertical donor design showed better psychosocial well-being than the group with other shapes of the donor flap. By considering the advantages and disadvantages of each flap design, enhanced patient satisfaction and durability and natural aesthetic goal can be achieved. This is the first study to compare the differences in results according to the flap design method during breast reconstruction. Patient satisfaction according to the design of the flap was investigated in the form of a questionnaire survey, and the results were displayed. In addition to breast shape, donor scars and complications were also investigated. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Use of the Allium Round Posterior Stent for the Treatment of Recurrent Vesicourethral Anastomosis Stricture.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes of monopolar incision and Allium Round Posterior Stent (RPS) insertion for the treatment of recurrent vesicourethral anastomosis stricture. METHODS: Having a suprapubic catheter and an obstructed pattern with a peak flow rate (PFR) ≤12 mL/s on uroflowmetry were the indications for the surgery. Once the fibrotic vesicourethral anastomosis was incised, RPS was inserted at the level of vesicourethral anastomosis under fluoroscopic guidance. All the stents were removed at postoperative first year. Patients were evaluated 3months after stent removal. Objective cure was defined as no need to further treatments and PFR ≥12 mL/s while subjective cure was defined as having points <4 on Patient Global Impression of Improvements scale. RESULTS: Of the 30 patients with a median age 66 (52-74) enrolled in the study, 18 had a suprapubic catheter, remaining 12 had median PFR 5.2 (2-10) mL/s. Stent migration was noted in two patients, these stents were replaced by new ones. Stone formation was diagnosed in one patient, a pneumatic-lithotripsy was performed. The median follow-up time was 28 (4-60) months following stent removal. Six cases needed further treatment after removal. The median PFR of remaining 24 patients was 20 (16-30) mL/s (P = .001). The objective cure rate was 24/30(80%), the Patient Global Impression of Improvements scores varied from 1 to 2, meaning subjective cure rate was 24/30(80%). For the six failed cases, according to patient preferences a lifetime RPS insertion was planned. CONCLUSION: With its minimally invasive nature, reversibility, and acceptable success and complication rates, incision of anastomosis and insertion of the RPS for a 1-year duration is a promising option for the treatment of recurrent vesicourethral anastomosis stricture.",0
Hospital doctors' and general practitioners' perspectives of outpatient discharge processes in Australia: an interpretive approach.,"BACKGROUND: Unnecessary delays in patient discharge from hospital outpatient clinics have direct consequences for timely access of new patients and the length of outpatient waiting times. The aim of this study was to gain better understanding of hospital doctors' and general practitioners' perspectives of the barriers and facilitators when discharging from hospital outpatients to general practice. METHODS: An interpretative approach incorporating semi-structured interviews with 15 participants enabled both hospital doctors and general practitioners to give their perspectives on hospital outpatient discharge processes. RESULTS: Participants mentioned various system problems hampering discharge from hospital outpatient clinics to general practice, such as limitations of electronic communication tools, workforce and workload challenges, the absence of agreed discharge principles, and lack of benchmark data. Hospital clinicians may keep patients under their care out of a concern about lack of follow-up and an inability to escalate timely hospital care following discharge. Some hospital clinicians may have a personal preference to provide ongoing care in the outpatient setting. Other factors mentioned were insufficient supervision of junior doctors, a patient preference to remain under hospital care, and the ease of scheduling follow-up appointments. An effective handover process requires protected time, a systematic approach, and a supportive clinical environment including user-friendly electronic communication and clinical handover tools. Several system improvements and models of care were suggested, such as agreed discharge processes, co-designed between hospitals and general practice. Recording and sharing outpatient discharge data may assist to inform and motivate hospital clinicians and support the training of junior doctors. General practitioners participating in the study were prepared to provide continuation of care but require timely clinical management plans that can be applied in the community setting. A hospital re-entry pathway providing rapid access to outpatient hospital resources after discharge could act as a safety net and may be an alternative to the standard 12-month review in hospital outpatient clinics. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the barriers to discharge as mentioned in the literature and adds the perspectives of both hospital clinicians and general practitioners. Potential solutions were suggested including co-designed discharge policies, improved electronic communication tools and a rapid hospital review pathway following discharge.",0
Choosing Or Losing In Behavioral Health: A Study Of Patients' Experiences Selecting Telehealth Versus In-Person Care.,"It is not known how the growth of telehealth has affected patients' choice of visit modalities (telehealth versus in person). In 2023 we conducted a mixed-methods study that paired a nationally representative survey of 2,071 adults (including 571 who used behavioral health services) and semistructured interviews with twenty-six people with depression or bipolar disorder. We explored patients' experiences with visit modality selection and their agency in the decision. Approximately one-third of patients receiving therapy or medication visits reported that their clinicians did not offer both modalities. Thirty-two percent reported that they did not typically receive their preferred modality, and 45 percent did not believe that their clinician considered their modality preferences. Qualitative findings revealed that some clinicians did not elicit patients' modality preferences. Perceived lack of choice affected satisfaction and rapport with clinicians and encouraged some people to seek care elsewhere. These findings highlight trade-offs in policies to preserve patient choice and approaches that clinicians can take to identify and accommodate patients' preferences.",0
Preferences for cardiovascular and pulmonary rehabilitation care: A discrete choice experiment among patients in Lebanon.,"OBJECTIVE: Patient preferences are important in designing optimal rehabilitation care. The aim of this study is to assess preferences for rehabilitation care among two groups of respondents. DESIGN: An online discrete choice experiment survey was carried out. SETTING: We use data for Lebanon, a country where rehabilitation care is still underdeveloped. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who have undergone or are currently undergoing rehabilitation treatment (users) and those who have not (yet) used rehabilitation care (non-users). INTERVENTION: Patients were asked to repeatedly choose between two hypothetical rehabilitation care packages with seven different attributes: attitude of the staff, travel time to clinic, out-of-pocket costs, medical equipment, rehabilitation plan, additional lifestyle education session, and support during rehabilitation care. MAIN MEASURES: Preference heterogeneity among patients with different characteristics was investigated using random effect binary logistic regression (software package Stata 15). RESULTS: In total, 126 respondents completed the survey. The most preferred attribute was an informal and friendly attitude of the staff followed by modern medical equipment, additional lifestyle education session via eHealth, and support during the rehabilitation program via phone call or SMS. Respondents were less in favor of going to the rehabilitation clinic and paying additional out-of-pocket costs for the rehabilitation treatment. This rank order was similar between users and non-users. CONCLUSION: Preferences of patients regarding the type of program chosen (eHealth or at clinical-based) need to be included in future rehabilitation programs. Improving patient experience with rehabilitation programs by giving the best care based on a patient-centered approach is essential.",1
Representation of women in orthopaedic surgery: perception of barriers among undergraduate medical students in Saudi Arabia.,"BACKGROUND: While female participation has improved in several surgical specialties over time globally, no such increase has been observed in orthopaedic surgery over the past decades. The potential barriers to female participation are likely present from the beginning of medical education. Therefore, this study assessed the apparent lag in equal representation among men and women in orthopaedic surgery in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a questionnaire survey to investigate medical students' and interns' perceptions of women participating in orthopaedic surgery, their subspeciality preferences, and barriers preventing them from pursuing an orthopaedic career. The responses were analysed to understand general perceptions, gender-based differences, impact of clinical experiential learning, and exposure to orthopaedic surgery. RESULTS: Approximately 565 medical students (49% females, 51% males) participated in the survey. Only 17% of students (11% females, 23% males) considered orthopaedic surgery as their future career option. While 31% of female and 17% of male students disagreed with the concept of female-appropriate orthopaedic subspecialties, most of the remaining male and female students perceived paediatric orthopaedics as a female-appropriate subspecialty. Concerning equal representation of women, gender bias and lack of a strong physique were the most frequently selected barriers by female and male students, respectively. Patient preference for male orthopaedicians, gender discrimination, social and family commitments, and need for physical strength were all perceived as barriers for women in orthopaedics. Overall, clinical experience and orthopaedic exposure did not significantly improve the likelihood of female students in choosing orthopaedic surgery as a career. CONCLUSIONS: The bias against women in orthopaedic careers is prevalent among medical students early in their academic years. Clinical experience and exposure to orthopaedic surgery should be improved to make a significant impact on female participation in orthopaedic careers. Career building efforts in terms of improved career opportunities, career counselling, flexible working hours, social and family related adjustments and implementation of mentorship/research/fellowship programmes for females are needed to reduce gender discrimination and improve female orthopaedic participation. Furthermore, process improvements may yield greater flexibility for women pursuing the challenging field while accommodating other barriers faced by women in orthopaedic surgery.",0

A practical proposal on treatment sequencing of metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours.,"According to the neuroendocrine tumour (NET) characteristics, 3 to 7 different treatment options are available, corresponding to 6 to 5,040 theoretical different sequences. Even though each patient is unique and despite a large heterogeneity in NET characteristics, the present review aims to discuss the main sequences and addresses how one can propose the best sequence to treat metastatic NET (mNET) on a case-by-case basis. Each treatment must be discussed during dedicated multi-disciplinary meetings, and inclusions in clinical trials should be favoured. After a thorough characterization of patients and their mNET, and taking into account the availability of drugs, the first-line treatment should be chosen according to the treatment aim. The latter is determined based on three main topics (efficacy, safety, and patient preferences) that do not necessarily converge and must be defined a priori. At baseline, physicians should design an a priori full therapeutic sequence, which may evolve at each step depending on the response to previous treatment, the occurrence of chronic toxicities, and the patients' perception of the prior treatment. To improve knowledge in terms of effectiveness and risk of cumulative toxicities regarding the different sequences, real-world data using long follow-up durations are necessary; such issues will not be resolved by randomized clinical trials.",0

A Narrative Review of Advancements in Understanding and Treating Varicose Veins.,"Chronic venous disease, with varicose veins as its archetypal manifestation, stands as a pervasive and intricate health quandary, encompassing a vast array of contributing factors. Age, genetics, obesity, pregnancy, and prolonged immobility weave a complex tapestry, underscoring the omnipresence of this ailment. Its societal and economic footprint is undeniably formidable, as diverse classifications underscore its multifaceted character. The intricate interplay of chronic venous disease with diabetes mellitus and neuropathy compounds the challenge, fostering soaring healthcare expenditures and a palpable erosion of quality of life, particularly among women harboring cardiometabolic risk factors. Despite research shedding light on heightened susceptibility within certain demographics, the enigmatic determinants orchestrating the transition from mild to severe chronic venous disease continue to elude us. Varicose veins, marked by the presence of dilated and tortuous subcutaneous vessels, precipitate both physical discomfort and cosmetic concerns, frequently necessitating meticulous clinical evaluation coupled with ultrasound studies to secure a precise diagnosis. Treatment strategies are strategically crafted to ameliorate distressing symptoms, enhance aesthetic concerns, and forestall potential complications. Nevertheless, the prognostication of chronic venous disease remains ensconced in a degree of ambiguity, hinting at the vast terrain yet to be charted in this medical domain. The quest to fathom the intricacies of this condition uncovers an ever-evolving panorama where conservative interventions play an indispensable role in managing mild cases, while interventional procedures like endovenous laser ablation and sclerotherapy step onto the stage for patients grappling with severe symptoms, thus treading the fine line between efficacy and invasiveness. Moreover, a meticulous economic analysis underscores the cost-effectiveness of various therapeutic modalities, thereby bolstering the imperative of a patient-centered approach. As we navigate the labyrinthine complexities of chronic venous disease and varicose vein management, we are inexorably drawn to the pivotal role of customized treatment approaches, as well as the dynamic interplay between scientific progress, patient preferences, and therapeutic innovations in the relentless pursuit of optimized outcomes and an enhanced quality of life.",0
It takes more than a machine: A pilot feasibility study of point-of-care HIV-1 viral load testing at a lower-level health center in rural western Uganda.,"Barriers continue to limit access to viral load (VL) monitoring across sub-Saharan Africa adversely impacting control of the HIV epidemic. The objective of this study was to determine whether the systems and processes required to realize the potential of rapid molecular technology are available at a prototypical lower-level (i.e., level III) health center in rural Uganda. In this open-label pilot study, participants underwent parallel VL testing at both the central laboratory (i.e., standard of care) and on-site using the GeneXpert HIV-1 assay. The primary outcome was the number of VL tests completed each clinic day. Secondary outcomes included the number of days from sample collection to receipt of result at clinic and the number of days from sample collection to patient receipt of the result. From August 2020 to July 2021, we enrolled a total of 242 participants. The median number of daily tests performed on the Xpert platform was 4, (IQR = 2-7). Time from sample collection to result was 51 days (IQR = 45-62) for samples sent to the central laboratory and 0 days (IQR = 0-0.25) for the Xpert assay conducted at the health center. However, few participants elected to receive results by one of the expedited options, which contributed to similar time-to-patient between testing approaches (89 versus 84 days, p = 0.07). Implementation of a rapid, near point-of-care VL assay at a lower-level health center in rural Uganda appears feasible, but interventions to promote rapid clinical response and influence patient preferences about result receipt require further study.

Antidepressants or running therapy: Comparing effects on mental and physical health in patients with depression and anxiety disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Antidepressant medication and running therapy are both effective treatments for patients with depressive and anxiety disorders. However, they may work through different pathophysiological mechanisms and could differ in their impact on physical health. This study examined effects of antidepressants versus running therapy on both mental and physical health. METHODS: According to a partially randomized patient preference design, 141 patients with depression and/or anxiety disorder were randomized or offered preferred 16-week treatment: antidepressant medication (escitalopram or sertraline) or group-based running therapy ≥2 per week. Baseline (T0) and post-treatment assessment at week 16 (T16) included mental (diagnosis status and symptom severity) and physical health indicators (metabolic and immune indicators, heart rate (variability), weight, lung function, hand grip strength, fitness). RESULTS: Of the 141 participants (mean age 38.2 years; 58.2 % female), 45 participants received antidepressant medication and 96 underwent running therapy. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that remission rates at T16 were comparable (antidepressants: 44.8 %; running: 43.3 %; p = .881). However, the groups differed significantly on various changes in physical health: weight (d = 0.57; p = .001), waist circumference (d = 0.44; p = .011), systolic (d = 0.45; p = .011) and diastolic (d = 0.53; p = .002) blood pressure, heart rate (d = 0.36; p = .033) and heart rate variability (d = 0.48; p = .006). LIMITATIONS: A minority of the participants was willing to be randomized; the running therapy was larger due to greater preference for this intervention. CONCLUSIONS: While the interventions had comparable effects on mental health, running therapy outperformed antidepressants on physical health, due to both larger improvements in the running therapy group as well as larger deterioration in the antidepressant group.

Comparing the Long-Term Success Rates of Tooth Preservation and Dental Implants: A Critical Review.,"Implant therapy is considered a predictable, safe, and reliable rehabilitation method for edentulous patients in most clinical scenarios. Thus, there is a growing trend in the indications for implants, which seems attributable not only to their clinical success but also to arguments such as a more ""simplified approach"" based on convenience or the belief that dental implants are as good as natural teeth. Therefore, the objective of this critical literature review of observational studies was to discuss the evidence concerning the long-term survival rates and treatment outcomes, comparing endodontically or periodontally treated teeth with dental implants. Altogether, the evidence suggests that the decision between keeping a tooth or replacing it with an implant should carefully consider the condition of the tooth (e.g., amount of remaining tooth and degree of attachment loss and mobility), systemic disorders, and patient preference. Although observational studies revealed high success rates and long-term survival of dental implants, failures and complications are common. For this reason, attempts should be made to first save maintainable teeth over the long-term, instead of immediately replacing teeth with dental implants.",0
Gaps in Patient-Centered Decision-Making Related to Complex Surgery: A Mixed-Methods Study.,"INTRODUCTION: We sought to understand the perceptions of surgeons around patient preferred roles in decision-making and their approaches to patient-centered decision-making (PCDM). METHODS: A concurrent embedded mixed-methods design was utilized among a cohort of surgeons performing complex surgical procedures. Data were collected through online surveys. Associations between perceptions and PCDM approaches were examined. RESULTS: Among 241 participants, most respondents were male (67.2%) with an average age of 47.6 y (standard deviation = 10.3); roughly half (52.4%) had practiced medicine for 10 or more years. Surgeons most frequently agreed (94.2%) with the statement, ""Patients prefer to make health decisions on their own after seriously considering their physician's opinion."" Conversely, surgeons most frequently disagreed (73.0%) with the statement, ""Patients prefer that their physician make health decisions for them."" Nearly one-third (30.4%) of surgeon qualitative responses (n = 115) indicated that clinical/biological information would help them tailor their approach to PCDM. Only 12.2% of respondents indicated that they assess patient preferences regarding both decision-making and information needs. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons most frequently agree that patients want to make their own health decisions after seriously considering their physicians opinion. A greater focus on what information surgeons should know before treatment decision-making may help optimize patient experience and outcomes related to complex surgical procedures.",0
Perioperative complications following open or endovascular revascularization for chronic limb-threatening ischemia in the BEST-CLI Trial.,"OBJECTIVE: Anticipated perioperative morbidity is an important factor for choosing a revascularization method for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). Our goal was to assess systemic perioperative complications of patients treated with surgical and endovascular revascularization in the Best Endovascular vs Best Surgical Therapy in Patients with CLTI (BEST-CLI) trial. METHODS: BEST-CLI was a prospective randomized trial comparing open (OPEN) and endovascular (ENDO) revascularization strategies for patients with CLTI. Two parallel cohorts were studied: Cohort 1 included patients with adequate single-segment great saphenous vein (SSGSV), whereas Cohort 2 included those without SSGSV. Data were queried for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE-composite myocardial infarction, stroke, death), non-serious (non-SAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) (criteria-death/life-threatening/requiring hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization/significant disability/incapacitation/affecting subject safety in trial) 30 days after the procedure. Per protocol analysis was used (intervention received without crossover), and risk-adjusted analysis was performed. RESULTS: There were 1367 patients (662 OPEN, 705 ENDO) in Cohort 1 and 379 patients (188 OPEN, 191 ENDO) in Cohort 2. Thirty-day mortality in Cohort 1 was 1.5% (OPEN 1.8%; ENDO 1.3%) and in Cohort 2 was 1.3% (2.7% OPEN; 0% ENDO). MACE in Cohort 1 was 4.7% for OPEN vs 3.13% for ENDO (P = .14), and in Cohort 2, was 4.28% for OPEN and 1.05% for ENDO (P = .15). On risk-adjusted analysis, there was no difference in 30-day MACE for OPEN vs ENDO for Cohort 1 (hazard ratio [HR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-2.64; P = .16) or Cohort 2 (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 0.48-9.88; P = .31). The incidence of acute renal failure was similar across interventions; in Cohort 1 it was 3.6% for OPEN vs 2.1% for ENDO (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.85-3.12; P = .14), and in Cohort 2, it was 4.2% OPEN vs 1.6% ENDO (HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 0.75-10.8; P = .12). The occurrence of venous thromboembolism was low overall and was similar between groups in Cohort 1 (OPEN 0.9%; ENDO 0.4%) and Cohort 2 (OPEN 0.5%; ENDO 0%). Rates of any non-SAEs in Cohort 1 were 23.4% in OPEN and 17.9% in ENDO (P = .013); in Cohort 2, they were 21.8% for OPEN and 19.9% for ENDO (P = .7). Rates for any SAEs in Cohort 1 were 35.3% for OPEN and 31.6% for ENDO (P = .15); in Cohort 2, they were 25.5% for OPEN and 23.6% for ENDO (P = .72). The most common types of non-SAEs and SAEs were infection, procedural complications, and cardiovascular events. CONCLUSIONS: In BEST-CLI, patients with CLTI who were deemed suitable candidates for open lower extremity bypass surgery had similar peri-procedural complications following either OPEN or ENDO revascularization: In such patients, concern about risk of peri-procedure complications should not be a deterrent in deciding revascularization strategy. Rather, other factors, including effectiveness in restoring perfusion and patient preference, are more relevant.",0
Patient preferences and cost-benefit of hypertension and hyperlipidemia collaborative management model between pharmacies and primary care in Portugal: A discrete choice experiment alongside a trial (USFarmácia®).,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about patient preferences and the value of pharmacy-collaborative disease management with primary care using technology-driven interprofessional communication under real-world conditions. Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) are useful for quantifying preferences for non-market services. OBJECTIVES: 1) To explore variation in patient preferences and estimate willingness-to-accept annual cost to the National Health Service (NHS) for attributes of a collaborative intervention trial between pharmacies and primary care using a trial exit DCE interview; 2) to incorporate a DCE into an economic evaluation using cost-benefit analysis (CBA). METHODS: We performed a DCE telephone interview with a sample of hypertension and hyperlipidemia trial patients 12 months after trial onset. We used five attributes (levels): waiting time to get urgent/not urgent medical appointment (7 days/45 days; 48 hrs./30 days; same day/15 days), model of pharmacy intervention (5-min. counter basic check; 15-min. office every 3 months for BP and medication review of selected medicines; 30-min. office every 6 months for comprehensive measurements and medication review of all medicines), integration with primary care (weak; partial; full), chance of having a stroke in 5 years (same; slightly lower; much lower), and annual cost to the NHS (0€; 30€; 51€; 76€). We used an experimental orthogonal fractional factorial design. Data were analyzed using conditional logit. We subtracted the estimated annual incremental trial costs from the mean WTA (Net Benefit) for CBA. RESULTS: A total of 122 patients completed the survey. Waiting time to get medical appointment-on the same day (urgent) and within 15 days (non-urgent)-was the most important attribute, followed by 30-minute pharmacy intervention in private office every 6 months for point-of-care measurements and medication review of all medicines, and full integration with primary care. The cost attribute was not significant. Intervention patients were willing to accept the NHS annual cost of €877 for their preferred scenario. The annual net benefit per patient is €788.20 and represents the monetary value of patients' welfare surplus for this model. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first conducted in Portugal alongside a pharmacy collaborative trial, incorporating DCE into CBA. The findings can be used to guide the design of pharmacy collaborative interventions with primary care with the potential for reimbursement for uncontrolled or at-risk chronic disease patients informed by patient preferences. Future DCE studies conducted in community pharmacy may provide additional contributions.

Risk Stratification of Cardiovascular Disease according to Age Groups in New Prevention Guidelines: A Review.,"Age is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, most cardiovascular risk prediction models have included age as an independent risk factor. There is much evidence that effective management of cardiovascular risk factors improves clinical outcomes even in older adults. However, there are concerns that intensive treatment for older adults increases the risk of adverse events. For hypertensive patients, intensive blood pressure reduction with combination therapy increases the risk of syncope, acute kidney injury, and falls. Intensive glucose-lowering therapy among older patients with diabetes increases the risk of hypoglycemia or cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that a balanced approach for older adults is required to increase the benefits and decrease the risk of side effects. In contrast to older people, the estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk in young and healthy individuals is low. However, the lifetime cardiovascular risk in these patients is actually high. The 2021 European Society of Cardiology guideline on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice has been published. It proposed a different risk stratification and recommendation for treatment according to age group, based on the concept of avoiding undertreatment in young people and overtreatment in older persons. Although the guideline recommends age-dependent risk stratification, risk categories should not be applied to the mandatory initiation of drug treatment. In all age groups, other factors such as lifetime cardiovascular risk, treatment benefit and harm, comorbidities, frailty, and patient preferences should be considered when managing patients for primary prevention.",0
Avelumab treatment for patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma can be safely stopped after 1 year and a PET/CT-confirmed complete response.,"BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) has shown high response rates, ranging from 33% to 73%. The ideal duration of treatment, however, is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate if avelumab treatment for mMCC can be safely stopped after 1 year of treatment and a complete response (CR) confirmed by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) imaging. METHODS: Patients who received more than one dose of avelumab treatment for mMCC between November 2017 and February 2022 were included in this study. Treatment was discontinued in case of a FDG-PET/CT confirmed CR after 1 year (26 cycles) of avelumab or a CR and unacceptable toxicity earlier. The primary end point was recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were included: 25 (38%) had a FDG-PET/CT-confirmed CR at discontinuation of avelumab. In those 25 patients, reasons for discontinuation of treatment were completion of 1 year of treatment in 13 (52%), toxicity in five (20%), and patient preference in seven (28%). Median duration of treatment in this group was 11 months (interquartile range, 6.1-11.7). Median follow-up was 27 months (interquartile range, 15.8-33.8). The 12-month RFS was 88% (95% CI, 0.74-1) and median RFS was not reached. Two patients (8%) had a recurrence at 4 and 7 months after discontinuation of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mMCC who acquire a CR on PET/CT imaging appear to have durable responses after discontinuation of treatment after 1 year.",0
Early switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy in patients with cancer who have low-risk neutropenic sepsis: the EASI-SWITCH RCT.,"BACKGROUND: Neutropenic sepsis is a common complication of systemic anticancer treatment. There is variation in practice in timing of switch to oral antibiotics after commencement of empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy. OBJECTIVES: To establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of early switch to oral antibiotics in patients with neutropenic sepsis at low risk of infective complications. DESIGN: A randomised, multicentre, open-label, allocation concealed, non-inferiority trial to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of early oral switch in comparison to standard care. SETTING: Nineteen UK oncology centres. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 16 years and over receiving systemic anticancer therapy with fever (≥ 38°C), or symptoms and signs of sepsis, and neutropenia (≤ 1.0 × 10(9)/l) within 24 hours of randomisation, with a Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer score of ≥ 21 and receiving intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam or meropenem for < 24 hours were eligible. Patients with acute leukaemia or stem cell transplant were excluded. INTERVENTION: Early switch to oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice daily) and co-amoxiclav (625 mg three times daily) within 12-24 hours of starting intravenous antibiotics to complete 5 days treatment in total. Control was standard care, that is, continuation of intravenous antibiotics for at least 48 hours with ongoing treatment at physician discretion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Treatment failure, a composite measure assessed at day 14 based on the following criteria: fever persistence or recurrence within 72 hours of starting intravenous antibiotics; escalation from protocolised antibiotics; critical care support or death. RESULTS: The study was closed early due to under-recruitment with 129 patients recruited; hence, a definitive conclusion regarding non-inferiority cannot be made. Sixty-five patients were randomised to the early switch arm and 64 to the standard care arm with subsequent intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses including 125 (intervention n = 61 and control n = 64) and 113 (intervention n = 53 and control n = 60) patients, respectively. In the intention-to-treat population the treatment failure rates were 14.1% in the control group and 24.6% in the intervention group, difference = 10.5% (95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.22). In the per-protocol population the treatment failure rates were 13.3% and 17.7% in control and intervention groups, respectively; difference = 3.7% (95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.148). Treatment failure predominantly consisted of persistence or recurrence of fever and/or physician-directed escalation from protocolised antibiotics with no critical care admissions or deaths. The median length of stay was shorter in the intervention group and adverse events reported were similar in both groups. Patients, particularly those with care-giving responsibilities, expressed a preference for early switch. However, differences in health-related quality of life and health resource use were small and not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Non-inferiority for early oral switch could not be proven due to trial under-recruitment. The findings suggest this may be an acceptable treatment strategy for some patients who can adhere to such a treatment regimen and would prefer a potentially reduced duration of hospitalisation while accepting increased risk of treatment failure resulting in re-admission. Further research should explore tools for patient stratification for low-risk de-escalation or ambulatory pathways including use of biomarkers and/or point-of-care rapid microbiological testing as an adjunct to clinical decision-making tools. This could include application to shorter-duration antimicrobial therapy in line with other antimicrobial stewardship studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered as ISRCTN84288963.

Understanding community-dwelling older adults' preferences for home- and community-based services: A conjoint analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Older adults' preference for home- and community-based service programs has been highlighted as an essential but usually ignored ingredient in current care models. Disentangling how preferences contribute to older adults' decision-making could facilitate finding optimal ways to deliver home- and community-based services in times of increasing scarcity. OBJECTIVE: To identify Chinese community-dwelling older adults' preference structure for home- and community-based services and thus to optimize service provision. METHODS: Conjoint analysis, a preference-based technique, was employed to study older adults' preferences. A stepwise qualitative approach was first adopted to identify the attributes and attribute levels of home- and community-based services. Scenarios were defined through an orthogonal fractional factorial design, and a cross-sectional survey was conducted through a face-to-face, anonymous questionnaire. Conjoint analysis was performed to determine preference weights representing the relative importance of the identified attributes, and cluster analysis was performed to identify clusters of participants with similar preference structures. All data analyses were performed using SAS v9.4 and SPSS 22.0. RESULTS: A total of 321 of 350 invited participants completed the questionnaire. Four attributes were identified and used to create the conjoint scenarios: care-giving attitude, price, technical care-giving skills, and the type of service provider. Care-giving attitude was the most valued attribute for older adults when making decisions (relative importance score = 48.28), followed by price (relative importance score = 21.618), technical care-giving skills (relative importance score = 19.518), and finally, the type of service provider (relative importance score = 10.585). Three preference phenotypes were identified by applying cluster analysis: ""price-oriented"", ""comprehensively balanced"", and ""attitude-oriented"". CONCLUSION: The present study underscored the importance of considering attributes valued by Chinese older adults in the design and delivery of home- and community-based services. The preference structure, including the utility score of the attribute levels, differs among older adults. The findings could inform future research and practice and suggest incorporating flexibility during the service delivery stage.",1
Active surveillance versus treatment in low-risk DCIS: Women's preferences in the LORD-trial.,"BACKGROUND: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) can progress to invasive breast cancer (IBC), but most DCIS lesions remain indolent. However, guidelines recommend surgery, often supplemented by radiotherapy. This implies overtreatment of indolent DCIS. The non-randomised patient preference LORD-trial tests whether active surveillance (AS) for low-risk DCIS is safe, by giving women with low-risk DCIS a choice between AS and conventional treatment (CT). Here, we aim to describe how participants are distributed among both trial arms, identify their motives for their preference, and assess factors associated with their choice. METHODS: Data were extracted from baseline questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the distribution and characteristics of participants; thematic analyses to extract self-reported reasons for the choice of trial arm, and multivariable logistic regression analyses to investigate associations between patient characteristics and chosen trial arm. RESULTS: Of 377 women included, 76% chose AS and 24% CT. Most frequently cited reasons for AS were ""treatment is not (yet) necessary"" (59%) and trust in the AS-plan (39%). Reasons for CT were cancer worry (51%) and perceived certainty (29%). Women opting for AS more often had lower educational levels (OR 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.93) and more often reported experiencing shared decision making (OR 2.71; 95% CI, 1.37-5.37) than women choosing CT. CONCLUSION: The LORD-trial is the first to offer women with low-risk DCIS a choice between CT and AS. Most women opted for AS and reported high levels of trust in the safety of AS. Their preferences highlight the necessity to establish the safety of AS for low-risk DCIS.",0
Discharge of Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients on Sub-Optimal Dual Anti-Platelet Therapy: A Single Center Experience.,"PURPOSE: To identify and quantify the reasons why acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing stenting at University of New Mexico Hospital were prescribed sub-optimal dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) at discharge, and to identify practice patterns that could potentially lead to improved DAPT treatment for these patients. METHODS: We reviewed electronic medical records and cardiac catheterization records of 326 patients who underwent PCI at UNMH between January 1, 2021, and June 30, 2022 and identified 229 ACS patients who survived until discharge. Demographic and clinical characteristics relevant to P2Y(12) selection were obtained from a review of medical records. Pharmacists' notes that documented their efforts to get appropriate insurance coverage and reasons for discharge on clopidogrel rather than ticagrelor were reviewed. Patients discharged on aspirin and clopidogrel underwent review of medical records and cardiac catheterization lab records to determine if the discharge P2Y(12) drug was appropriate. Reasons for inappropriately discharge on clopidogrel were categorized as cost/insurance, patient preference, concern for daily adherence to a twice-daily medication, and on clopidogrel before PCI and not switched to ticagrelor afterward. RESULTS: The 229 ACS patients included (38.0%, n = 87) appropriately discharged on ticagrelor/prasugrel, (27.5%, n = 63) appropriately discharged on clopidogrel, (32.8%, n = 75) inappropriately discharged on clopidogrel, and (1.7%, n = 4) not discharged on a P2Y(12) inhibitor. For patients inappropriately discharged on clopidogrel (n = 75), the most common reasons were cost or lack of insurance (n = 56) and clinical inertia (taking clopidogrel before PCI and maintained on it afterward) (n = 17). Inappropriate DAPT at discharge correlated with lack of insurance (90.5% compared to 39.7% in patients with insurance, P < 0.001) but not with ethnicity. CONCLUSION: At the University of New Mexico, a safety-net hospital, increasing financially restricted access to ticagrelor could help up to 24.5% of ACS patients reduce their risk of ischemic events. For patients admitted on clopidogrel DAPT, upgrading to ticagrelor could reduce ischemic risk in 7.4% of ACS patients. Expanding healthcare insurance coverage might redue sub-optimal DAPT coverage.",0
Understanding and preventing nonadherence and treatment dropout in adolescents and young adults with anxiety and depressive disorders.,"Dropout from psychological or pharmacological treatment for anxiety and depressive disorders is common. It is especially problematic in adolescents and young adults because of the adverse consequences for their development. Reasons for treatment dropout can be divided into therapy-process related factors, attitudinal aspects, and practical issues. Adjusting treatment to patient preferences and shared decision making, improving the therapeutic alliance, and interventions such as (family) psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, and help with practical issues are promising strategies to optimize engagement and adherence.",0
New insights into acupuncture techniques for poststroke spasticity.,"With the trend of aging population getting more obvious, stroke has already been a major public health problem worldwide. As a main disabling motor impairment after stroke, spasticity has unexpected negative impacts on the quality of life and social participation in patients. Moreover, it brings heavy economic burden to the family and society. Previous researches indicated that abnormality of neural modulation and muscle property corelates with the pathogenesis of poststroke spasticity (PSS). So far, there still lacks golden standardized treatment regimen for PSS; furthermore, certain potential adverse-events of the mainstream therapy, for example, drug-induced generalized muscle weakness or high risk related surgery somehow decrease patient preference and compliance, which brings challenges to disease treatment and follow-up care. As an essential non-pharmacological therapy, acupuncture has long been used for PSS in China and shows favorable effects on improvements of spastic hypertonia and motor function. Notably, previous studies focused mainly on the research of antispastic acupoints. In comparison, few studies lay special stress on the other significant factor impacting on acupuncture efficacy, that is acupuncture technique. Based on current evidences from the clinic and laboratory, we will discuss certain new insights into acupuncture technique, in particular the antispastic needling technique, for PSS management in light of its potential effects on central modulations as well as peripheral adjustments, and attempt to provide some suggestions for future studies with respect to the intervention timing and course, application of acupuncture techniques, acupoint selection, predictive and aggravating factors of PSS, aiming at optimization of antispastic acupuncture regimen and improvement of quality of life in stroke patients. More innovations including rigorous study design, valid objective assessments for spasticity, and related experimental studies are worthy to be expected in the years ahead.",0
Patient preferences for active ulcerative colitis treatments and fecal microbiota transplantation.,"BACKGROUND: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising treatment for active ulcerative colitis (UC). Understanding patient preferences can identify treatment features that may impact treatment decisions, improve shared decision-making, and contribute to patient-centered care, which is especially important in the context of novel treatments like FMT. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to quantify preferences for active UC treatments, specifically FMT and biologics, and identify patient characteristics associated with different preference patterns. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional survey study. METHODS: We administered a discrete choice experiment (DCE) survey to elicit preferences in a sample of Canadian adults with UC. DCE data were analyzed using a main-effects mixed logit model and used to predict uptake of hypothetical scenarios reflecting alternative combinations of treatment features. Latent class modeling identified heterogeneity in patient preference patterns. RESULTS: Participants' (n = 201) mean age was 47.1 years (SD: 14.5 years), 58% were female, and most (84%) had at least some post-secondary education. Almost half were willing to undergo FMT. When considering treatments for active UC, the most important attributes were chance of remission and severity of rare unknown side effects. All else equal, participants were most likely to uptake treatment that involves oral capsules/pills. Participants in the class with the highest utility for chance of remission were younger, had more severe disease, and 58% indicated that they would be willing to undergo FMT. CONCLUSION: We identified characteristics of UC patients who are more likely to be interested in FMT using preference elicitation methods. Patient-centered care can be enhanced by knowing which patients are more likely to be interested in FMT, potentially improving satisfaction with and adherence to treatments for active UC to maximize the effectiveness of treatment while considering heterogeneity in patient preferences.",1
Merging machine learning and patient preference: a novel tool for risk prediction of percutaneous coronary interventions.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Predicting personalized risk for adverse events following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains critical in weighing treatment options, employing risk mitigation strategies, and enhancing shared decision-making. This study aimed to employ machine learning models using pre-procedural variables to accurately predict common post-PCI complications. METHODS: A group of 66 adults underwent a semiquantitative survey assessing a preferred list of outcomes and model display. The machine learning cohort included 107 793 patients undergoing PCI procedures performed at 48 hospitals in Michigan between 1 April 2018 and 31 December 2021 in the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Cardiovascular Consortium (BMC2) registry separated into training and validation cohorts. External validation was conducted in the Cardiac Care Outcomes Assessment Program database of 56 583 procedures in 33 hospitals in Washington. RESULTS: Overall rate of in-hospital mortality was 1.85% (n = 1999), acute kidney injury 2.51% (n = 2519), new-onset dialysis 0.44% (n = 462), stroke 0.41% (n = 447), major bleeding 0.89% (n = 942), and transfusion 2.41% (n = 2592). The model demonstrated robust discrimination and calibration for mortality {area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.930 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.920-0.940]}, acute kidney injury [AUC: 0.893 (95% CI 0.883-0.903)], dialysis [AUC: 0.951 (95% CI 0.939-0.964)], stroke [AUC: 0.751 (95%CI 0.714-0.787)], transfusion [AUC: 0.917 (95% CI 0.907-0.925)], and major bleeding [AUC: 0.887 (95% CI 0.870-0.905)]. Similar discrimination was noted in the external validation population. Survey subjects preferred a comprehensive list of individually reported post-procedure outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Using common pre-procedural risk factors, the BMC2 machine learning models accurately predict post-PCI outcomes. Utilizing patient feedback, the BMC2 models employ a patient-centred tool to clearly display risks to patients and providers (https://shiny.bmc2.org/pci-prediction/). Enhanced risk prediction prior to PCI could help inform treatment selection and shared decision-making discussions.",0

Advancing precision oncology through systematic germline and tumor genetic analysis: The oncogenetic point of view on findings from a prospective multicenter clinical trial of 666 patients.,"INTRODUCTION: With the emergence of targeted therapies, there is a need to accurately identify more tumor biomarkers. The EXOMA trial was designed to offer tumor and germline exome sequencing (ES) to patients with solid malignant tumors and facing therapeutic failure. As hereditary cancer predispositions could be identified, with genetic counseling and health management implications, a genetic consultation was systematically established. This design needs to be discussed as genetic human resources are limited and indication of theranostic tests will increase. METHODS: Genetic counseling was conducted within 15 days following inclusion in the study for patients recruited between December 2015 and July 2019. In silico analyses from theranostic ES were limited to 317 genes involved in oncogenesis, from both tumor and blood DNA. RESULTS: Six hundred and sixty six patients had a genetic consultation before ES. In 65/666 patients, 66 germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants were identified in 16 actionable genes and seven non-actionable genes according to French guidelines. 24/65 patients had previously received genetic analysis for diagnostic purposes, and for 17 of them, a P/LP variant had already been identified. Among the 48/65 remaining cases for which the EXOMA protocol revealed a previously unknown P/LP variant, only 19 met the criteria for genetic testing for inherited cancer risk after familial survey. These criteria had not been identified by the oncologist in 10 cases. In 21/65 cases, the variant was considered incidental. DISCUSSION: In 7.4% of patients, an undiagnosed hereditary genetic predisposition was identified, whether or not related to the clinical presentation, and germline analysis impacted oncological management for only 6.3% of the cohort. This low percentage should be weighed against the burden of systematic genetic consultation and urgent circuits. Information or training tools to form oncologists to the prescription of germline genetic analyses should be explored, as well as information supports and patient preferences.",0
Experiences Navigating the Pregnancy Care Continuum During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented changes in care delivery across the pregnancy care continuum. Our primary objective with this research was to characterize the range of ways that the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic affected pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care experiences. METHODS: Pregnant and recently pregnant patients (n = 20) from obstetrics and gynecology clinical sites associated with Massachusetts General Hospital were interviewed about their experiences with prenatal care, childbirth, and postpartum care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interview transcripts were analyzed for emergent themes. RESULTS: This sample included 20 pregnant and postpartum people, including 11 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 during pregnancy or postpartum and nine with suspected infection. The ways in which COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19 affected experiences of prenatal care, childbirth, and postpartum care were complex and varied. Three themes were identified across narratives of pregnancy, birth, and postpartum care: patient perceptions of diminished access to care, stigma due to COVID-19 infection, and limited capacity of providers to honor patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of pregnant and recently pregnant people's experiences during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic can inform infection control policies and clinical care delivery practices that are more congruent with the needs and values of pregnant, birthing, and postpartum people as institutions craft responses to future pandemics. Approaches that maximize meaningful access across the pregnancy care continuum, center patients' priorities within adapted care models, and honor patient preferences as much as possible are important aspects of an appropriate response to future waves of COVID-19 and other pandemics.",0
"Which symptom to address in psychological treatment for cancer survivors when fear of cancer recurrence, depressive symptoms, and cancer-related fatigue co-occur? Exploring the level of agreement between three systematic approaches to select the focus of ","PURPOSE: To investigate the extent to which three systematic approaches for prioritizing symptoms lead to similar treatment advices in cancer survivors with co-occurring fear of cancer recurrence, depressive symptoms, and/or cancer-related fatigue. METHODS: Psychological treatment advices were was based on three approaches: patient preference, symptom severity, and temporal precedence of symptoms based on ecological momentary assessments. The level of agreement was calculated according to the Kappa statistic. RESULTS: Overall, we found limited agreement between the three approaches. Pairwise comparison showed moderate agreement between patient preference and symptom severity. Most patients preferred treatment for fatigue. Treatment for fear of cancer recurrence was mostly indicated when based on symptom severity. Agreement between temporal precedence and the other approaches was slight. A clear treatment advice based on temporal precedence was possible in 57% of cases. In cases where it was possible, all symptoms were about equally likely to be indicated. CONCLUSIONS: The three approaches lead to different treatment advices. Future research should determine how the approaches are related to treatment outcome. We propose to discuss the results of each approach in a shared decision-making process to make a well-informed and personalized decision with regard to which symptom to target in psychological treatment. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: This study contributes to the development of systematic approaches for selecting the focus of psychological treatment in cancer survivors with co-occurring symptoms by providing and comparing three different systematic approaches for prioritizing symptoms.",0
Improving oncology first-in-human and Window of opportunity informed consent forms through participant feedback.,"BACKGROUND: Although patient advocates have developed templates for standard consent forms, evaluating patient preferences for first in human (FIH) and window of opportunity (Window) trial consent forms is critical due to their unique risks. FIH trials are the initial use of a novel compound in study participants. In contrast, Window trials give an investigational agent over a fixed duration to treatment naïve patients in the time between diagnosis and standard of care (SOC) surgery. Our goal was to determine the patient-preferred presentation of important information in consent forms for these trials. METHODS: The study consisted of two phases: (1) analyses of oncology FIH and Window consents; (2) interviews of trial participants. FIH consent forms were analyzed for the location(s) of information stating that the study drug has not been tested in humans (FIH information); Window consents were analyzed for the location(s) of information stating the trial may delay SOC surgery (delay information). Participants were asked about their preferred placement of the information in their own trial's consent form. The location of information in the consent forms was compared to the participants' suggestions for placement. RESULTS: 34 [17 FIH; 17 Window] of 42(81%) cancer patients approached participated. 25 consents [20 FIH; 5 Window] were analyzed. 19/20 FIH consent forms included FIH information, and 4/5 Window consent forms included delay information. 19/20(95%) FIH consent forms contained FIH information in the risks section 12/17(71%) patients preferred the same. Fourteen (82%) patients wanted FIH information in the purpose, but only 5(25%) consents mentioned it there. 9/17(53%) Window patients preferred delay information to be located early in the consent, before the ""Risks"" section.  3/5(60%) consents did this. CONCLUSIONS: Designing consents that reflect patient preferences more accurately is essential for ethical informed consent; however, a one-size fits all approach will not accurately capture patient preferences. We found that preferences differed for FIH and Window trial consents, though for both, patients preferred key risk information early in the consent. Next steps include determining if FIH and Window consent templates improve understanding.",0
Primary Whole-gland Ablation for the Treatment of Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: A Focal Therapy Society Best Practice Statement.,"CONTEXT: Whole-gland ablation is a feasible and effective minimally invasive treatment for localized prostate cancer (PCa). Previous systematic reviews supported evidence for favorable functional outcomes, but oncological outcomes were inconclusive owing to limited follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the real-world data on the mid- to long-term oncological and functional outcomes of whole-gland cryoablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in patients with clinically localized PCa, and to provide expert recommendations and commentary on these findings. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library publications through February 2022 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. As endpoints, baseline clinical characteristics, and oncological and functional outcomes were assessed. To estimate the pooled prevalence of oncological, functional, and toxicity outcomes, and to quantify and explain the heterogeneity, random-effect meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Twenty-nine studies were identified, including 14 on cryoablation and 15 on HIFU with a median follow-up of 72 mo. Most of the studies were retrospective (n = 23), with IDEAL (idea, development, exploration, assessment, and long-term study) stage 2b (n = 20) being most common. Biochemical recurrence-free survival, cancer-specific survival, overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and metastasis-free survival rates at 10 yr were 58%, 96%, 63%, 71-79%, and 84%, respectively. Erectile function was preserved in 37% of cases, and overall pad-free continence was achieved in 96% of cases, with a 1-yr rate of 97.4-98.8%. The rates of stricture, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, rectourethral fistula, and sepsis were observed to be 11%, 9.5%, 8%, 0.7%, and 0.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The mid- to long-term real-world data, and the safety profiles of cryoablation and HIFU are sound to support and be offered as primary treatment for appropriate patients with localized PCa. When compared with other existing treatment modalities for PCa, these ablative therapies provide nearly equivalent intermediate- to long-term oncological and toxicity outcomes, as well as excellent pad-free continence rates in the primary setting. This real-world clinical evidence provides long-term oncological and functional outcomes that enhance shared decision-making when balancing risks and expected outcomes that reflect patient preferences and values. PATIENT SUMMARY: Cryoablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound are minimally invasive treatments available to selectively treat localized prostate cancer, considering their nearly comparable intermediate- to long term cancer control and preservation of urinary continence to other radical treatments in the primary setting. However, a well-informed decision should be made based on one's values and preferences.",0
"Definitely, Maybe: Helping Patients Make Decisions about Surgery When Prognosis Is Uncertain.","AbstractThe sudden onset of severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) is an event suffered by millions of individuals each year. Regardless of this frequency in occurrence, accurate prognostication remains difficult to achieve among physicians. There are many variables that affect this prognosis. Physicians are expected to assess the clinical indications of the brain injury while considering other factors such as patient quality of life, patient preferences, and environmental context. However, this lack of certainty in prognosis can ultimately affect treatment recommendations and prompt clinical ethical issues at the bedside, as it leaves room for physician bias and interpretation. In this article, we introduce data on neurosurgeon values that may shed light on the process physicians and patients involved in sTBI undergo. In doing so, we highlight the many nuances in decision-making for patients suffering from sTBI and discuss potential solutions to better patient-physician or surrogate-physician interactions.",0

Giant condyloma acuminatum surgical management: a case report and literature review.,"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Condyloma acuminatum (CA) or genital warts, represents a rare sexually transmitted disease caused by the human papillomavirus. Infection occurs when host basal cells are exposed to viral infection through a damaged epithelial barrier, during sexual intercourse, or due to other minor skin abrasions. Giant condyloma acuminatum (GCA) has a higher rate of malignant transformation than CA. CASE PRESENTATION: We are presenting a 44-year-old single gentleman known as a smoker, hepatitis B positive, vitiligo, and hypercholesteromia. He was an alcoholic and had multiple heterosexual relationships abroad. Referred from the dermatology clinic, complaining of genital warts that had increased in size for 10 years. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: CA management includes local applications like imiquimod and podophyllotoxin and clinician-administered treatments such as cryotherapy, surgical excision, electrosurgery, and CO(2) laser therapy. Other options, such as interferon, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy, are available. The selection of therapy should be individualized and based upon consideration of the extent of the disease, patient preference, cost, adverse effects, treatment availability, and the response to previous treatments. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice for GCA. CONCLUSION: We present a patient with GCA in the perianal area that was surgically treated with an excellent outcome.",0
Patient Perception of Route of Rectal Administration of Live Biotherapeutic Product for Recurrent Clostridioides difficile Infection.,"INTRODUCTION: CDI is a recurrent disease that is treated with antibiotics, but patients commonly experience repeat infections with significant impacts on hospital budgets and patient health quality. Standard of care management includes the antibiotics, vancomycin and fidaxomicin, which frequently provide clinical response, but do not avoid recurrence of Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI). These recurrent infections occur due to dysbiosis of the colonic microbiota. One adjunctive therapeutic approach is to restore the deficient gastrointestinal flora using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or live biotherapeutic products (LBP) when given after standard of care antimicrobials, which have been successful in reducing repeat infections with success rates up to 88%. FMT or LBP can be given by various routes. METHODS: Two groups of subjects aged ≥18 years with at least one previous CDI episode within the previous 36 months completed self-administered online surveys to assess the acceptability of an LBP administered rectally. Group 1 consisted of LBP-recipients who had received RBL (REBYOTA) rectally as part of the Phase III PUNCH CD3 clinical trial. Group 2 consisted of LBP-naïve subjects who volunteered to participate and had experienced CDI within the prior 36 months but had no history of receiving FMT or LBP therapy. RESULTS: LBP-recipients considered rectal administration easy (96%) and quick (94%), while 98% of respondents considered the lack of need for bowel preparation appealing. Most LBP-recipients (96%) wished they had earlier access to RBL. Most LBP-naïve subjects (87%) were likely or somewhat likely to consider a rectally administered treatment and 80% preferred a treatment option that does not require bowel preparation. Many of these subjects (76%) expressed interest in finding out about new treatment options for rCDI. DISCUSSION: LBP-recipients and LBP-naïve subjects alike felt that rectal delivery of microbiome therapy is not only acceptable but highly interesting as a treatment avenue.",0
Queensland Inpatient Diabetes Survey (QuIDS): patient experience survey evaluation.,"BACKGROUND: Measurement of inpatient experience can allow for treatment tailored to patient preferences and needs. The patient experience of diabetes care has not been explored in Queensland hospitals. AIMS: To investigate the experiences of patients with diabetes when hospitalised using the Queensland Inpatient Diabetes Survey (QuIDS). METHODS: In 2019 and 2021, patient experience surveys were collected as part of the statewide QuIDS, a cross-sectional study assessing the quality of inpatient care received by people with diabetes in Queensland, Australia. Patient responses were categorised and frequencies reported as percentages. Free text comments were analysed using thematic analysis methods. Pooled descriptive data were presented. RESULTS: Responses were collected from 27 hospitals in 2019 (n = 526, 52.4% of all patients with diabetes) and 35 hospitals in 2021 (n = 709, 55.5%). Overall, patients were satisfied with their inpatient diabetes care. Areas for improvement identified by surveyed patients include the choice and timing of meals, staff knowledge about diabetes and increased diabetes self-management. Access to a specialist diabetes team was also identified as being potentially underutilised. Patient comments fell into four major themes: communication, food choices, patient autonomy and education. CONCLUSION: Many patients reported positive inpatient experiences; however, patients also expressed dissatisfaction with their inpatient diabetes care. Our data provide unique insight and an opportunity to improve standards of care and service provision for inpatients with diabetes.",0
Solid-state analysis for pharmaceuticals: Pathways to feasible and meaningful analysis.,"The solid state of matter is the preferred starting point for designing a pharmaceutical product. This is driven by both patient preferences and the relative ease of supplying a solid pharmaceutical product with desired quality and performance. Solid form diversity is increasingly prevalent as a crucial element in designing these products, which underpins the importance of solid-state analytical methods. This paper provides a critical analysis of challenges related to solid-state analytics, as well as considerations and suggestions for feasible and meaningful pharmaceutical analysis.",0
Mapping European Association of Urology Guideline Practice Across Europe: An Audit of Androgen Deprivation Therapy Use Before Prostate Cancer Surgery in 6598 Cases in 187 Hospitals Across 31 European Countries.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence-practice gaps exist in urology. We previously surveyed European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for strong recommendations underpinned by high-certainty evidence that impact patient experience for which practice variations were suspected. The recommendation ""Do not offer neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) before surgery for patients with prostate cancer"" was prioritised for further investigation. ADT before surgery is neither clinically effective nor cost effective and has serious side effects. The first step in improving implementation problems is to understand their extent. A clear picture of practice regarding ADT before surgery across Europe is not available. OBJECTIVE: To assess current ADT use before prostate cancer surgery in Europe. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was an observational cross-sectional study. We retrospectively audited recent ADT practices in a multicentre international setting. We used nonprobability purposive sampling, aiming for breadth in terms of low- versus high-volume, academic, versus community and public versus private centres. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Our primary outcome was adherence to the ADT recommendation. Descriptive statistics and a multilevel model were used to investigate differences between countries across different factors (volume, centre type, and funding type). Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with low, intermediate, and high risk, and for those with locally advanced prostate cancer. We also collected reasons for nonadherence. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: We included 6598 patients with prostate cancer from 187 hospitals in 31 countries from January 1, 2017 to May 1, 2020. Overall, nonadherence was 2%, (range 0-32%). Most of the variability was found in the high-risk subgroup, for which nonadherence was 4% (range 0-43%). Reasons for nonadherence included attempts to improve oncological outcomes or preoperative tumour parameters; attempts to control the cancer because of long waiting lists; and patient preference (changing one's mind from radiotherapy to surgery after neoadjuvant ADT had commenced or feeling that the side effects were intolerable). Although we purposively sampled for variety within countries (public/private, academic/community, high/low-volume), a selection bias toward centres with awareness of guidelines is possible, so adherence rates may be overestimated. CONCLUSIONS: EAU guidelines recommend against ADT use before prostate cancer surgery, yet some guideline-discordant ADT use remains at the cost of patient experience and an additional payer and provider burden. Strategies towards discontinuation of inappropriate preoperative ADT use should be pursued. PATIENT SUMMARY: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is sometimes used in men with prostate cancer who will not benefit from it. ADT causes side effects such as weight gain and emotional changes and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Guidelines strongly recommend that men opting for surgery should not receive ADT, but it is unclear how well the guidance is followed. We asked urologists across Europe how patients in their institutions were treated over the past few years. Most do not use ADT before surgery, but this still happens in some places. More research is needed to help doctors to stop using ADT in patients who will not benefit from it.",0
Pharmacogenomic Testing for Major Depression: A Qualitative Study of the Perceptions of People with Lived Experience and Professional Stakeholders.,"OBJECTIVES: With increasing evidence for the clinical utility of pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing for depression, there is a growing need to consider issues related to the clinical implementation of this testing. The perspectives of key stakeholders (both people with lived experience [PWLE] and providers) are critical, but not frequently explored. The purpose of this study was to understand how PWLE and healthcare providers/policy experts (P/HCPs) perceive PGx testing for depression, to inform the consideration of clinical implementation within the healthcare system in British Columbia (BC), Canada. METHODS: We recruited two cohorts of participants to complete individual 1-h, semi-structured interviews: (a) PWLE, recruited from patient and research engagement networks and organizations and (b) P/HCPs, recruited via targeted invitation. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, de-identified, and analysed using interpretive description. RESULTS: Seventeen interviews were completed with PWLE (7 with experience of PGx testing for depression; 10 without); 15 interviews were completed with P/HCPs (family physicians, psychiatrists, nurses, pharmacists, genetic counsellors, medical geneticists, lab technologists, program directors, and insurers). Visual models of PWLE's and P/HCP's perceptions of and attitudes towards PGx testing were developed separately, but both were heavily influenced by participants' prior professional and/or personal experiences with depression and/or PGx testing. Both groups expressed a need for evidence and numerous considerations for the implementation of PGx testing in BC, including the requirement for conclusive economic analyses, patient and provider education, technological and clinical support, local testing facilities, and measures to ensure equitable access to testing. CONCLUSIONS: While hopeful about the potential for therapeutic benefit from PGx testing, PWLE and P/HCPs see the need for robust evidence of utility, and BC-wide infrastructure and policies to ensure equitable and effective access to PGx testing. Further research into the accessibility, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of various implementation strategies is needed to inform PGx testing use in BC.",0
"Comprehensive, Evidence-Based, Consensus Guidelines for Prescription of Opioids for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP).","BACKGROUND: Opioid prescribing in the United States is decreasing, however, the opioid epidemic is continuing at an uncontrollable rate. Available data show a significant number of opioid deaths, primarily associated with illicit fentanyl use. It is interesting to also note that the data show no clear correlation between opioid prescribing (either number of prescriptions or morphine milligram equivalent [MME] per capita), opioid hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, the data suggest that the 2016 guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have resulted in notable problems including increased hospitalizations and mental health disorders due to the lack of appropriate opioid prescribing as well as inaptly rapid tapering or weaning processes. Consequently, when examined in light of other policies and complications caused by COVID-19, a fourth wave of the opioid epidemic has been emerging. OBJECTIVES: In light of this, we herein seek to provide guidance for the prescription of opioids for the management of chronic non-cancer pain. These clinical practice guidelines are based upon a systematic review of both clinical and epidemiological evidence and have been developed by a panel of multidisciplinary experts assessing the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations and offer a clear explanation of logical relationships between various care options and health outcomes. METHODS: The methods utilized included the development of objectives and key questions for the various facets of opioid prescribing practice. Also utilized were employment of trustworthy standards, and appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest(s). The literature pertaining to opioid use, abuse, effectiveness, and adverse consequences was reviewed. The recommendations were developed after the appropriate review of text and questions by a panel of multidisciplinary subject matter experts, who tabulated comments, incorporated changes, and developed focal responses to questions posed. The multidisciplinary panel finalized 20 guideline recommendations for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Summary of the results showed over 90% agreement for the final 20 recommendations with strong consensus. The consensus guidelines included 4 sections specific to opioid therapy with 1) ten recommendations particular to initial steps of opioid therapy; 2) five recommendations for assessment of effectiveness of opioid therapy; 3) three recommendations regarding monitoring adherence and side effects; and 4) two general, final phase recommendations. LIMITATIONS: There is a continued paucity of literature of long-term opioid therapy addressing chronic non-cancer pain. Further, significant biases exist in the preparation of guidelines, which has led to highly variable rules and regulations across various states. CONCLUSION: These guidelines were developed based upon a comprehensive review of the literature, consensus among expert panelists, and in alignment with patient preferences, and shared decision-making so as to improve the long-term pain relief and function in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. Consequently, it was concluded - and herein recommended - that chronic opioid therapy should be provided in low doses with appropriate adherence monitoring and understanding of adverse events only to those patients with a proven medical necessity, and who exhibit stable improvement in both pain relief and activities of daily function, either independently or in conjunction with other modalities of treatments.",0

Approach to Patients with High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer: Radiation Oncology Perspective.,"High-risk localized prostate cancer is a challenging clinical entity to treat, with heterogeneous responses to an evolving array of multidisciplinary treatment approaches. In addition, this disease state is growing in incidence due to a variety of factors, including shifting recommendations that discouraged routine prostate cancer screening. Current guidelines now incorporate an informed decision-making process for prostate cancer screening and evaluation. More work is underway to improve targeted screening for certain at-risk populations and to implement greater personalization in the use of diagnostic tools. Once diagnosed with high-risk localized disease, a multimodality treatment paradigm is warranted. Radiation-in its various forms and combinations-plays a large and continually evolving role in the management of high-risk prostate cancer, yet treatment outcomes are still suboptimal. There is a growing need to improve upon current treatment approaches, and better personalize a particular treatment recommendation based on both tumor and patient characteristics, as well as patient preference and goals of therapy. Given that treatment generally requires more than one therapy, there are notable implications on long-term quality of life, especially with respect to overlapping and cumulative side effects of local and systemic therapies, respectively. The desire for aggressive therapy to optimize cancer control outcomes must be weighed against the risk of morbidities and overtreatment and discussed with each patient so that an informed decision about treatment and care can be determined. High-level evidence to support treatment recommendations, where available, is critical for a data-driven and tailored approach to address all goals of care.",0
A 23-year-old patient with bilateral hypoplastic thumbs and toes: A case report.,"KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: However, it is noteworthy that certain patients with minor functional limitations in their hand may have experienced undiagnosed thumb hypoplasia during their childhood years. These individuals may have successfully adapted to their condition without seeking medical intervention and may express a preference for nonintervention (as in this case). ABSTRACT: Thumb hypoplasia is a congenital underdevelopment of the thumb, accounting for 5%-15% of congenital hand disorders. It occurs equally among both genders and can affect both thumbs. The condition is categorized using Blauth's classification with Type I being the mildest form. We report a 23-year-old Syrian male presented with a bilateral restriction in opposition movement when using a pen or razor. Clinical examination and x-ray imaging revealed a bilateral Type I hypoplastic thumb with bilateral minimal hypoplasia of the toes. Despite the surgical treatment options available, the patient opted not to undergo surgery due to his adaptation to his condition. Hypoplastic thumb Type I is a congenital condition characterized by underdevelopment of the thumb. Bilateral thumb hypoplasia with toes hypoplasia is extremely rare. A full systemic evaluation should be done due to its associations with other syndromic manifestations and treatment options are discussed concerning the best functional outcomes and patient preferences.",0
High-Grade Ectopic Pituitary Adenoma within the Cerebellopontine Angle: A Case Report.,"Ectopic pituitary tumors are neoplasms with no connection to the pituitary gland and are commonly deposited in other areas of the anterior skull base. A 32-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of right-sided facial weakness, sensorineural hearing loss, diplopia, and severe headaches. Physical examination revealed a mid-dilated sluggishly reactive right pupil with slight limitation in all gazes, as well as right-sided orbicularis weakness, lagophthalmos, and decreased facial sensation. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head without contrast revealed a 3.7 × 1.8 × 2.6 cm mildly enhancing mass in the right internal acoustic meatus and along the petrous ridge. The case was brought before the institution's tumor board, where concern for higher grade pathology, such as hemangiopericytoma, was discussed. Per patient preference, surgical biopsy of the tumor was performed. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a World Health Organization (WHO) grade II neuroendocrine tumor, with cells staining positive for synaptophysin, chromogranin, and CD56, with a K (i) -67 index of 8%. In addition to the ectopic location, this pituitary tumor was noted to be aggressive in nature based on its high K (i) -67 index. Surgical excision and radiologic therapy of tumors involving the CPA are appropriate treatments in most cases.",0
Contributing and limiting factors to guideline-adherent therapy in senior and elderly breast cancer patients: a questionnaire-based cross-sectional study using clinical and cancer registry data in Germany.,"PURPOSE: Elderly cancer patients are less likely to be treated in accordance with evidence-based guideline recommendations. This study examines patient-related factors associated with deviations from guideline recommendations. METHODS: Using medical documentation and cancer registry data, we investigated the treatment courses of female breast cancer patients aged 50 and older in Germany regarding compliance with German guidelines. Participants completed a questionnaire querying factors hypothesized to be associated with guideline adherence. We conducted univariate analyses to explore the data and select variables for multivariate logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: Of 1150 participants, 206 (17.9%) were treated in deviation from guideline recommendations. Patients 70 years and older were more likely to be treated deviating from guideline recommendations than patients 50-69 years old (OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.52-2.80). Patients aged 50-69 years who reported that quality of life guided their treatment decision were more likely to be treated in deviation from guideline recommendations (AOR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.11-3.92) than the elderly. In older patients, higher age was associated with an increased chance of receiving guideline-discordant care (AOR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01-1.11), as was depression diagnosed prior to cancer (AOR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.00-3.40). CONCLUSION: Reasons for deviations from guideline recommendations in breast cancer patients differ by age. In decision-making concerning elderly patients, particular attention should be paid to those with pre-existing depressive disorders. Adequately addressing their needs and concerns could prevent inappropriate deviations from guideline recommendations.",0
Patient Preferences for Attributes that Characterise Alternative Models of Care in Gastroenterology: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: Increased demand for gastroenterology services has resulted in growing waitlists, with patients at risk of exceeding clinically recommended wait-times. Given limited healthcare resources, expanded scope models of care are an option to help address this demand, but little is known about patient preferences for these models of care. METHODS: Low-risk gastroenterology patients (n = 1198) referred to an outpatient tertiary service in Australia over a 2-year period were invited to participate in an unlabelled discrete choice experiment with seven attributes: primary healthcare professional, wait-time, continuity of care, consultation length, manner and communication skills, reassurance, and cost. These were developed using qualitative research, literature review, and stakeholders' experiences. A d-efficient fractional design was used to construct four blocks of 12 choice sets, with two alternatives. A 13th choice set was included as a data and quality check. Latent class and mixed logit regression were used for analysis. The resulting preference parameters for individual attributes were then used to calculate willingness to pay and willingness to wait. RESULTS: Overall, the model based on the 347 respondents suggested no strong preference for professional background. All other attributes were statistically significant predictors of preference (p < 0.001), with respondents willing to make significant trade-offs (time and cost) before accepting deterioration in attributes. There was strong emphasis on manner and communication skills, with a clinician who listens and provides good explanations overwhelmingly the most important attribute. Latent class analysis identified two patient segments who differed in their preference for the primary treating healthcare professional (doctor or dietitian) based on exposure to either traditional medical or non-medical professional role substitution model. CONCLUSIONS: Patients have strong but varied preferences for gastroenterology services based on whether they have been exposed to expanded scope models of care. Design and implementation of new models of care need to consider strategies to overcome any perceived loss in utility or deterioration in healthcare quality for those unfamiliar with professional role substitution.",1
Taking a chance: How likely am I to receive my preferred treatment in a clinical trial?,"Researchers should ideally conduct clinical trials under a presumption of clinical equipoise, but in fact trial patients will often prefer one or other of the treatments being compared. Receiving an unblinded preferred treatment may affect the study outcome, possibly beneficially, but receiving a non-preferred treatment may induce 'reluctant acquiescence', and poorer outcomes. Even in blinded trials, patients' primary motivation to enrol may be the chance of potentially receiving a desirable experimental treatment, which is otherwise unavailable. Study designs with a higher probability of receiving a preferred treatment (denoted as 'concordance') will be attractive to potential participants, and investigators, because they may improve recruitment and hence enhance study efficiency. Therefore, it is useful to consider the concordance rates associated with various study designs. We consider this question with a focus on comparing the standard, randomised, two-arm, parallel group design with the two-stage randomised patient preference design and Zelen designs; we also mention the fully randomised and partially randomised patient preference designs. For each of these designs, we evaluate the concordance rate as a function of the proportions randomised to the alternative treatments, the distribution of preferences over treatments, and (for the Zelen designs) the proportion of patients who consent to receive their assigned treatment. We also examine the equity of each design, which we define as the similarity between the concordance rates for participants with different treatment preferences. Finally, we contrast each of the alternative designs with the standard design in terms of gain in concordance and change in equity.",0
National survey on management of spontaneous pneumothorax from emergency department to specialised treatment: room for improvement.,"INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) affects both young, otherwise healthy individuals and older persons with known underlying pulmonary disease. Initial management possibilities are evolving and range from observation to chest tube insertion. SP guidelines suggest an individualized approach based on multiple factors such as symptoms, size of pneumothorax, comorbidity and patient preference. AIM: With this Danish national survey we aimed to map organization of care including involved specialties, treatment choice, training, and follow-up plans to identify aspects, and optimization of spontaneous pneumothorax management. METHOD: A survey developed by the national interest group for pleural medicine was sent to all departments of emergency medicine, thoracic surgery, respiratory medicine, and to relevant departments of abdominal or orthopaedic surgery. RESULTS: The response rate was 75 % (47 of 65). Overall, 21% of responding departments had no guideline for SP management, which was provided by multiple specialties with marked heterogeneity in choice of treatment including tube size, management during admission, and referral procedure to follow-up. Few departments required procedure training, and nearly all of the responders called for improvements in management of pneumothorax. CONCLUSION: This survey suggests that SP management and care is delivered heterogeneously across Danish hospitals with marked difference between respiratory physicians, emergency physicians, general surgeons and thoracic surgeons. It is therefore likely that management is sub-optimal. There is a need for a common Danish SP guideline to ensure optimal treatment across involved specialties.",0
Preferences in medications for patients seeking treatment for opioid use disorder: A conjoint analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: The opioid epidemic continues to be a public health crisis that has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are the most effective way to reduce complications from opioid use disorder (OUD), but uptake is limited by both structural and individual factors. To inform strategies addressing individual factors, we evaluated patients' preferences and trade-offs in treatment decisions using conjoint analysis. METHOD: We developed a conjoint analysis survey evaluating patients' preferences for FDA-approved MOUDs. We recruited patients with OUD presenting to initiate treatment. This survey included five attributes: induction, location and route of administration, impact on mortality, side effects, and withdrawal symptoms with cessation. Participants performed 12 choice sets, each with two hypothetical profiles and a ""none"" option. We used Hierarchical Bayes to identify relative importance of each attribute and part-worth utility scores of levels, which we compared using chi-squared analysis. We used the STROBE checklist to guide our reporting of this cross-sectional observational study. RESULTS: Five-hundred and thirty participants completed the study. Location with route of administration was the most important attribute. Symptom relief during induction and withdrawal was a second priority. Mortality followed by side effects had lowest relative importance. Attribute levels with highest part-worth utilities showed patients preferred monthly pick-up from a pharmacy rather than daily supervised dosing; and oral medications more than injection/implants, despite the latter's infrequency. CONCLUSION: We measured treatment preferences among patients seeking to initiate OUD treatment to inform strategies to scale MOUD treatment uptake. Patients prioritize the route of administration in treatment preference-less frequent pick up, but also injections and implants were less preferred despite their convenience. Second, patients prioritize symptom relief during the induction and withdrawal procedures of medication. These transition periods influence the sustainability of treatment. Although health professionals prioritize mortality, it did not drive decision-making for patients. To our knowledge, this is the largest study on patients' preferences for MOUD among treatment-seeking people with OUD to date. Future analysis will evaluate patient preference heterogeneity to further target program planning, counseling, and decision aid development.",1
American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Practice Guideline: Pharmacological Management of Chronic Idiopathic Constipation.,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is a common disorder associated with significant impairment in quality of life. This clinical practice guideline, jointly developed by the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology, aims to inform clinicians and patients by providing evidence-based practice recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of CIC in adults. METHODS: The American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that conducted systematic reviews of the following agents: fiber, osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol, magnesium oxide, lactulose), stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, senna), secretagogues (lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide), and serotonin type 4 agonist (prucalopride). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to assess the certainty of evidence for each intervention. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop clinical recommendations based on the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 10 recommendations for the pharmacological management of CIC in adults. Based on available evidence, the panel made strong recommendations for the use of polyethylene glycol, sodium picosulfate, linaclotide, plecanatide, and prucalopride for CIC in adults. Conditional recommendations were made for the use of fiber, lactulose, senna, magnesium oxide, and lubiprostone. DISCUSSION: This document provides a comprehensive outline of the various over-the-counter and prescription pharmacological agents available for the treatment of CIC. The guidelines are meant to provide a framework for approaching the management of CIC; clinical providers should engage in shared decision making based on patient preferences as well as medication cost and availability. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted to help guide future research opportunities and enhance the care of patients with chronic constipation.",0
Structural barriers or patient preference? A mixed methods appraisal of medical abortion use in England and Wales.,"Although patient choice of abortion method is a key component of quality care, medical abortion (MA) has become the most common method (87%) in England and Wales, as in many countries worldwide. This research aimed to critically examine factors influencing the growth in MA use in England and Wales. Mixed methods were used, combining multi-level regression analysis of national abortion statistics (2011-2020) and key informant interviews with abortion service managers, commissioners, and providers (n=27). Overall trends have been driven by growth in MA use for abortions under 10 weeks in the private non-profit sector. Variation in MA use between patient sub-groups and regions has narrowed over time. Qualitative findings highlight health system constraints that have influenced the shift towards MA, including workforce constraints, infrastructure requirements, provider policies, cost, and commissioning practices involving under-funding and competition, which have caused the private non-profit sector to limit method choice across their services to remain financially viable. While removal of legal restrictions on MA has expanded choice, similar policy progress has not been seen for surgical methods. The study concludes that abortion method choice has been constrained by structural health system factors, with potential negative consequences for service acceptability, inequalities, and patient-centredness.",0
Patient Preferences in Targeted Pharmacotherapy for Cancers: A Systematic Review of Discrete Choice Experiments.,"BACKGROUND: Targeted pharmacotherapy has been increasingly applied in cancer treatment due to its breakthroughs. However, the unmet needs of cancer patients are still significant, highlighting the urgency to investigate patient preferences. It is unclear how patients deliberate their choices between different aspects of targeted therapy, including cost, efficacy, and adverse events. Since discrete choice experiments (DCEs) have been widely applied to patient preference elicitation, we reviewed DCEs on targeted therapy for different cancers. We also synthesized evidence on the factors influencing patients' choices and their willingness-to-pay (WTP) for survival when treated by targeted therapy. METHODS: We searched databases, including PubMed, EMBASE and MEDLINE, up to August 16, 2022, supplemented by a reference screening. The attributes from the selected studies were categorized into three groups: outcomes, costs, and process. We also calculated the relative importance of attributes and WTP for survival whenever possible. The purpose, respondents, explanation, findings, significance (PREFS) checklist was used to evaluate the quality of the included DCE studies. RESULTS: The review identified 34 eligible studies from 13 countries covering 14 cancers, such as breast, ovarian, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers. It also reveals a rising trend of DCEs on this topic, as most studies were published after 2018. We found that patients placed higher weights on the outcome (e.g., overall survival) and cost attributes than on process attributes. On average, patients were willing to pay $561 (95% confidence interval [CI]: $415-$758) and $716 (95% CI $524-$958) out-of-pocket for a 1-month increase in progression-free survival and overall survival, respectively. PREFS scores of the 34 studies ranged from 2 to 4, with a mean of 3.38 (SD: 0.65), suggesting a reasonable quality based on the checklist. However, most studies (n = 32, 94%) did not assess the impact of non-responses on the results. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first systematic review focusing on patient preferences for targeted cancer therapy. We showcased novel approaches for evidence synthesis of DCE results, especially the attribute relative importance and WTP. The results may inform stakeholders about patient preferences toward targeted therapy and their WTP estimates. More studies with improved study design and quality are warranted to generate more robust evidence to assist decision making.",1
Outcomes of Operative Versus Nonoperative Management for Hallux Rigidus: A Tertiary Care Center Experience.,"Background This study aims to investigate and report the outcomes of various management modalities used for hallux rigidus, a common form of degenerative joint disease affecting the foot and ankle. The research focuses on understanding the pathophysiology, classification systems, and nonoperative approaches such as medical therapy, intra-articular injections, shoe modifications, and physical therapy. Surgical techniques, including joint-sparing and joint-sacrificing procedures, are explored, considering factors such as disease stage and patient preferences. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), Riyadh. The study included all patients who were diagnosed with hallux rigidus from the period 2016 to 2022. Data were collected through the BESTCare system at KAMC. All the data were collected through Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) and transferred for analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25 (Released 2017; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York). Frequencies and percentages were used to detail categorical variables, whereas continuous variables were examined by the mean and standard deviation. A p-value of <0.05 was considered to report the statistical significance. Results A total of 84 patients were included. The majority were women (60.7%). Diabetes and hypertension were prevalent comorbidities, affecting 21.4% and 35.7% of patients, respectively. Nonoperative management was the most common approach (66.7%). Complications were minimal (2.4% infections, 1.2% metatarsalgia), and 67.9% of patients reported no persistence of symptoms after treatment. Conclusion The low complication rates and the lack of significant associations between treatment modalities and outcomes suggest the generally safe and effective nature of the employed interventions. These findings can guide clinicians in making informed decisions regarding the management of hallux rigidus, while also highlighting areas for further research to improve treatment strategies and outcomes.",0
What drives poor quality of care for child diarrhea? Experimental evidence from India.,"Most health care providers in developing countries know that oral rehydration salts (ORS) are a lifesaving and inexpensive treatment for child diarrhea, yet few prescribe it. This know-do gap has puzzled experts for decades. Using randomized experiments in India, we estimated the extent to which ORS underprescription is driven by perceptions that patients do not want ORS, provider's financial incentives, and ORS stock-outs (out-of-stock events). Patients expressing a preference for ORS increased ORS prescribing by 27 percentage points. Eliminating stock-outs increased ORS provision by 7 percentage points. Removing financial incentives did not affect ORS prescribing on average but did increase ORS prescribing at pharmacies. We estimate that perceptions that patients do not want ORS explain 42% of underprescribing, whereas stock-outs and financial incentives explain only 6 and 5%, respectively.",0
A discrete choice experiment on oral and injection treatment preferences among moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients in Japan.,"Long-term psoriasis (PsO) management remains challenging. With growing variation in treatment efficacy, cost, and modes of administration, patient preferences for different treatment characteristics are not well understood. A discrete choice experiment (DCE), informed by qualitative patient interviews, was conducted to assess patient preferences for different attributes of PsO treatments; 222 adult patients with moderate-to-severe PsO receiving systemic therapy participated in the DCE web survey. Better long-term efficacy and lower cost were preferred (preference weights p < 0.05). Long-term efficacy had the highest relative importance (RI) and mode of administration was as important as the outcome attributes (efficacy and safety). Patients also preferred oral to injectable administration. In subgroup analyses by disease severity, residence, psoriatic arthritis as a comorbidity, and gender, the trends for each subgroup were the same as the overall population although the extent of RI for administration mode varied. Mode of administration was more important for patients with moderate versus severe disease, or rural versus urban residence. This DCE utilized attributes related to both oral and injectable treatment as well as a broad study population of systemic treatment users. Preferences were further stratified by patient characteristics to explore trends in different subgroups. Understanding the RI of treatment attributes and the attribute trade-offs acceptable to patients helps inform moderate-to-severe PsO systemic treatments decisions.",1
Promoting Informed Decisions About Colorectal Cancer Screening in Older Adults (PRIMED Study): a Physician Cluster Randomized Trial.,"BACKGROUND: For adults aged 76-85, guidelines recommend individualizing decision-making about whether to continue colorectal cancer (CRC) testing. These conversations can be challenging as they need to consider a patient's CRC risk, life expectancy, and preferences. OBJECTIVE: To promote shared decision-making (SDM) for CRC testing decisions for older adults. DESIGN: Two-arm, multi-site cluster randomized trial, assigning physicians to Intervention and Comparator arms. Patients were surveyed shortly after the visit to assess outcomes. Analyses were intention-to-treat. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Primary care physicians affiliated with 5 academic and community hospital networks and their patients aged 76-85 who were due for CRC testing and had a visit during the study period. INTERVENTIONS: Intervention arm physicians completed a 2-h online course in SDM communication skills and received an electronic reminder of patients eligible for CRC testing shortly before the visit. Comparator arm received reminders only. MAIN MEASURES: The primary outcome was patient-reported SDM Process score (range 0-4 with higher scores indicating more SDM); secondary outcomes included patient-reported discussion of CRC screening, knowledge, intention, and satisfaction with the visit. KEY RESULTS: Sixty-seven physicians (Intervention n=34 and Comparator n=33) enrolled. Patient participants (n=466) were on average 79 years old, 50% with excellent or very good self-rated overall health, and 66% had one or more prior colonoscopies. Patients in the Intervention arm had higher SDM Process scores (adjusted mean difference 0.36 (95%CI (0.08, 0.64), p=0.01) than in the Comparator arm. More patients in the Intervention arm reported discussing CRC screening during the visit (72% vs. 60%, p=0.03) and had higher intention to follow through with their preferred approach (58.0% vs. 47.1, p=0.03). Knowledge scores and visit satisfaction did not differ significantly between arms. CONCLUSION: Physician training plus reminders were effective in increasing SDM and frequency of CRC testing discussions in an age group where SDM is essential. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03959696).",0

Rivaroxaban versus Apixaban for Treatment of Cancer-Associated Venous Thromboembolism in Patients at Lower Risk of Bleeding.,"This retrospective study, utilizing U.S. electronic health record (EHR) data from January 2013 to December 2020, sought to assess whether rivaroxaban and apixaban had similar effectiveness and safety in the treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with a cancer type not associated with a high risk of bleeding. We included adults diagnosed with active cancer, excluding esophageal, gastric, unresected colorectal, bladder, noncerebral central nervous system cancers and leukemia, who experienced VTE and received a therapeutic VTE dose of rivaroxaban or apixaban on day 7 post-VTE, and were active in the EHR ≥12 months prior to the VTE. Primary outcome was the composite of recurrent VTE or any bleed resulting in hospitalization at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included recurrent VTE, any bleed resulting in hospitalization, any critical organ bleed, and composites of these outcomes at 3 and 6 months. Inverse probability of treatment-weighted Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We included 1,344 apixaban and 1,093 rivaroxaban patients. At 3 months, rivaroxaban was found to have similar hazard to apixaban for developing recurrent VTE or any bleed resulting in hospitalization (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.60-1.27). No differences were observed between cohorts for this outcome at 6 months (HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.71-1.40) or for any other outcome at 3 or 6 months. In conclusion, patients receiving rivaroxaban or apixaban showed similar risks of the composite of recurrent VTE or any bleed resulting in hospitalization in patients with cancer-associated VTE. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT05461807. Key Points Rivaroxaban and apixaban have similar effectiveness and safety for treatment of cancer-associated VTE through 6 months.Clinicians should therefore consider patient preference and adherence when choosing the optimal anticoagulant.",0
Psoriasis patient preferences for the use of biologics during the coronavirus era.,"Understanding patient preferences concerning the use of biologics for psoriasis treatment can support proper treatment selection to satisfy their needs. In Japan, limited studies have reported psoriasis patients' preferences for the use of biologics, and many of those focused on the improvement of skin symptoms. The present study was conducted as a web-based questionnaire survey using the discrete choice experiment approach to investigate the preferences of psoriasis patients for the use of biologics, as well as to describe social and clinical factors that influence these preferences. The following attributes were selected for the discrete choice experiment: efficacy at 1 year, risk of serious infections requiring hospitalization, incidence of injection site reactions, administration route and visits, co-payment, indications, and efficacy on skin symptoms and other manifestations (the last two have not been evaluated in previous studies). Data were collected from October 4 to October 8, 2021. An analysis of data from 357 psoriasis patients indicated that the most preferred attributes for biologics selection were administration route and visits, followed by the risk of serious infections requiring hospitalization. Some differences were observed among specific subgroups. This study demonstrated that patients with psoriasis prefer biologics with a less frequent administration route and visit schedule and a lower risk of serious infections requiring hospitalization, which contrasts with the results obtained in previous studies where the highest importance was placed on drug effectiveness. These results may reflect the personal and social impact of the coronavirus disease outbreak at the time of the survey. The results of this study might help physicians properly select biologics that satisfy psoriasis patients' needs, leading to better treatment adherence.",1

Policy Preferences Regarding Health Data Sharing Among Patients With Cancer: Public Deliberations.,"BACKGROUND: Precision health offers the promise of advancing clinical care in data-driven, evidence-based, and personalized ways. However, complex data sharing infrastructures, for-profit (commercial) and nonprofit partnerships, and systems for data governance have been created with little attention to the values, expectations, and preferences of patients about how they want to be engaged in the sharing and use of their health information. We solicited patient opinions about institutional policy options using public deliberation methods to address this gap. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to understand the policy preferences of current and former patients with cancer regarding the sharing of health information collected in the contexts of health information exchange and commercial partnerships and to identify the values invoked and perceived risks and benefits of health data sharing considered by the participants when formulating their policy preferences. METHODS: We conducted 2 public deliberations, including predeliberation and postdeliberation surveys, with patients who had a current or former cancer diagnosis (n=61). Following informational presentations, the participants engaged in facilitated small-group deliberations to discuss and rank policy preferences related to health information sharing, such as the use of a patient portal, email or SMS text messaging, signage in health care settings, opting out of commercial data sharing, payment, and preservation of the status quo. The participants ranked their policy preferences individually, as small groups by mutual agreement, and then again individually in the postdeliberation survey. RESULTS: After deliberation, the patient portal was ranked as the most preferred policy choice. The participants ranked no change in status quo as the least preferred policy option by a wide margin. Throughout the study, the participants expressed concerns about transparency and awareness, convenience, and accessibility of information about health data sharing. Concerns about the status quo centered around a lack of transparency, awareness, and control. Specifically, the patients were not aware of how, when, or why their data were being used and wanted more transparency in these regards as well as greater control and autonomy around the use of their health data. The deliberations suggested that patient portals would be a good place to provide additional information about data sharing practices but that over time, notifications should be tailored to patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests the need for increased disclosure of health information sharing practices. Describing health data sharing practices through patient portals or other mechanisms personalized to patient preferences would minimize the concerns expressed by patients about the extent of data sharing that occurs without their knowledge. Future research and policies should identify ways to increase patient control over health data sharing without reducing the societal benefits of data sharing.",0
Hospital-based spiritual care: what matters to patients?,"Demographic changes in Australia have led to an increase in both religious diversity and the number of people who do not nominate a faith affiliation at hospital admission. Models of chaplaincy have shifted from clerical and largely male to an increasingly skilled and diverse spiritual care workforce appointed directly by health services. This study uses survey and in-depth interview methods at an inner-city Australian hospital to examine patient preferences for hospital chaplaincy provided by faith communities, and the importance of faith affiliation compared to other spiritual care provider characteristics. Survey results indicate that of 110 respondents, a high proportion (74%) prefer spiritual care to be provided by a person of the same faith. However, when considered relative to other characteristics, faith affiliation was not as important as kindness, listening skills and a non-judgmental attitude. Our findings have implications for workforce planning and educating. Further research in different settings and with different populations will make the findings more generalizable.",0
Clinical Practices Surrounding the Prescription of Home Oxygen in Patients With COPD and Desaturation.,"PURPOSE: While home oxygen therapy increases survival in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have severe resting hypoxemia, recent evidence suggests that there is no survival benefit of home oxygen for patients with COPD who have isolated exertional desaturation. We aimed to understand clinician practice patterns surrounding the prescription of home oxygen for patients with COPD. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews via videoconference with 15 physicians and 3 nurse practitioners who provide care for patients with COPD. Clinicians were recruited through the American Lung Association Airways Clinical Research Centers. Interview guides were created with the assistance of patient investigators and included questions regarding clinician practices surrounding the prescription of oxygen for patients with COPD and the use of clinical guidelines. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded for themes. RESULTS: Of the 18 clinician interviewees, one-third were women, with most participants (n=11) being < 50 years old. Results of the semi-structured interviews suggested research evidence, clinical experience, and patient preferences contributed to clinician decision-making. Most clinicians described a shared decision-making process for prescribing home oxygen for patients, including discussion of risks and benefits, and developing an understanding of patient values and preferences. Clinicians did not use a structured tool to conduct these conversations. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians consider a number of patient and clinical factors when prescribing home oxygen therapy, often using a shared decision-making process. Tools to support shared decision-making about the use of home oxygen are needed.",0
Endometrial ablation techniques in treating menorrhagia.,"Menorrhagia is a frequent gynecological problem that is clinically described as excessive blood loss of 80 mL per menstrual cycle. It has the potential to lower their quality of life and to induce anemia. Medical therapy has typically been the first line of treatment; however, it is frequently ineffectual. Hysterectomy, on the other hand, is clearly 100 percent effective in stopping bleeding, but it is more expensive and can cause serious problems. So, the endometrial ablation is preferred when the endometrial layer is destroyed or removed during the procedure. To ""ablate"" (remove) the endometrial lining, a variety of procedures has been devised. The gold standard resectoscopic procedures (laser, transcervical endometrial resection, and rollerball) require hysteroscopic visualization of the uterus and while safe, necessitate expert surgeons. Several innovative procedures have lately been developed, the majority of which may be conducted blindly and take less time. Many nonresectoscopic procedures are still in the process of being developed, refined, and investigated. This article discusses the various techniques and procedures used in endometrial ablation, the importance of the physician using endometrial thinning agents because success rates are higher when thinning agents are used, and the importance of women understanding the complications mainly related to pregnancy. Women should be helped to make informed management decisions by discussing the risks and benefits of each treatment with their consultant. Since there are many treatment options available, with no one option being superior in all respects, patient preference and treatment preferences should be considered when deciding on management.",0
Laparoscopic versus robotic inguinal hernia repair: a single-center case-matched study.,"INTRODUCTION: Robotic inguinal hernia repair (RIHR) is becoming increasingly common and is the minimally invasive alternative to laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR). Thus far, there is little data directly comparing LIHR and RIHR. The purpose of this study will be to compare outcomes for LIHR and RIHR at a single center. METHODS: A prospective institutional hernia database was queried for patients who underwent transabdominal LIHR or RIHR from 2012 to 2020. The patients were then matched based on the surgeon performing the operation (single, expert hernia surgeon) and laterality of repair. Standard descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: There were 282 patients who met criteria for the study, 141 LIHR and 141 RIHR; 32.6% of patients in each group had a bilateral repair (p = 1.00). LIHR patients were slightly younger (54.4 ± 15.6 vs 58.6 ± 13.8; p = 0.03) but similar in terms of BMI (27.1 ± 5.1 vs 29.1 ± 2.1; p = 0.70) and number of comorbidities (2.9 ± 2.5 vs 2.6 ± 2.2; p = 0.59). Operative time was found to be longer in the RIHR group, but when evaluating RIHR at the beginning of the study versus the end of the study, there was a 50-min decrease in operative time (p < 0.01). Recurrence rates were low for both groups (0.7% vs 1.4%; p = 0.38) with mean follow-up time 13.0 ± 13.3 months. There was only one wound infection, which was in the robotic group. No patients required return to the operating room for complications relating to their surgery. There were no 30-day readmissions in the LIHR group and three 30-day readmissions in the RIHR group (p = 0.28). CONCLUSION: LIHR and RIHR are both performed with low morbidity and have comparable overall outcomes. The total charges were increased in the RIHR group. Either LIHR or RIHR may be considered when performing inguinal hernia repair and should depend on surgeon and patient preference; continued evaluation of the outcomes is warranted.",0
Retreatment rates and postprocedural complications are higher than expected after BPH surgeries: a US healthcare claims and utilization study.,"BACKGROUND: Up to 50% of men over 50 and 80% over 80 are affected by BPH. Shared decision-making regarding BPH treatment options can benefit from an improved understanding of relative risks and benefits for various treatments. METHODS: Data for this longitudinal retrospective population-based cohort study were obtained from a random sample of US Medicare and commercial claims (IBM Watson MarketScan) and restricted to men undergoing BPH surgery (TURP, PVP, PUL, WVTT) from 2015 to 2021 across all sites of service. Retreatments included Holmium laser enucleation and index procedures. Main outcomes were rates of retreatment and procedural complications over 1 year, identified via CPT and ICD-9/10CM codes. Procedural complications that occurred at least 1 day post-index treatment were assessed, as were surgical retreatments with patients who had at least 1 and 5 year's-worth of data. Baseline phenotype characterization did not control for symptomatology and was limited to age, comorbidities, and BMI. Univariate cumulative incidence estimates, cumulative proportion and log-rank tests justified inclusion for covariate (e.g., age, comorbidities) adjustment in Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: 43,147 men diagnosed with BPH underwent 22,629 TURP, 11,392 PVP, 7,529 PUL, and 1,597 WVTT. At 1-year post-index: PUL was associated with the lowest rate of complication (PUL 15%, TURP 17%; PVP 19%, ; WVTT 26%); retreatment rates were not different (TURP 5.3%, PVP 5.3%, PUL 5.9%, WVTT 6.2%). At 5 years post-index: retreatment was lowest for TURP (7.0%) and was not significantly different between PVP and PUL (8.9% and 11.6%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Real-world patients diagnosed with BPH may be selected to undergo one of the various available therapies based on patient preference or baseline phenotype. These therapies, however, are associated with different risks for complications. The results of this study suggest that within one year of BPH surgery, one-in-twenty patients may require retreatment regardless of treatment choice, and for some technologies as many as one-in-four may require treatment for a complication.",0
Remote vs in-person BRCA1/2 non-carriers test disclosure: patients' choice during Covid-19 pandemic restriction.,"During Covid-19 pandemic most hospitals have restricted in-person delivery of non-essential healthcare services, including genetic testing delivery, to slow the spread of the virus. Our Onco-Genetic Service also faced this challenging period and had to re-organize its clinical practice with the use of tele-health. Aim of the present paper is to understand whether and how Covid-19-related changes in medical practice influenced patients' satisfaction about the health service provided. 125 BRCA1/2 non carriers (109/125, 87.2% female and 16/125, 12.8% male) in Istituto Tumori ""Giovanni Paolo II"" of Bari were enrolled. All participants were asked to choose whether they prefer in-person or remote post-test counselling session. Basing on patients' choice, two groups of subjects were composed. One week after the post-test counselling session, participants were phone called and asked to complete: a socio-demographic form, a brief structured interview about their Covid-19 related worries and their satisfaction with the health service provided, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Fear of Covid-19 scale. Qualitative information about patients' choice were also collected. No significant difference about patients' satisfaction with the health service provided emerged between groups. Patients who preferred remote post-test counselling had higher anxiety, worries and fear-of Covid-19 than the others. All remote-counselling subjects preferred tele-genetics because of Covid-19 security, would choose it again and would recommend it to others. Cancer tele-genetics offers good guarantees of comfort and efficacy, but patients' choices are related to personal and psychological variables. The use of tele-genetics has to be a patient's choice.",0
Managing the challenge of a small aortic annulus in patients with severe aortic stenosis.,"INTRODUCTION: Small aortic annulus (SAA) poses a challenge in the management of patients with severe aortic stenosis requiring aortic valve replacement - both surgical and transcatheter - since it has been associated with worse clinical outcomes. AREAS COVERED: This review aims to comprehensively summarize the available evidence regarding the management of aortic stenosis in patients with SAA and discuss the current controversies as well as future perspectives in this field. EXPERT OPINION: It is paramount to agree in a common definition for diagnosing and properly treating SAA patients, and for that purpose, multidetector computer tomography is essential. The results of recent trials led to the expansion of transcatheter aortic valve replacement among patients of all the surgical-risk spectrum, and the choice of treatment (transcatheter, surgical) should be based on patient comorbidities, anatomical characteristics, and patient preferences.",0

Identifying Patterns in Preoperative Communication about High-Risk Surgical Intervention: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.,"INTRODUCTION: Surgeons are entrusted with providing patients with information necessary for deliberation about surgical intervention. Ideally, surgical consultations generate a shared understanding of the treatment experience and determine whether surgery aligns with a patient's overall health goals. In-depth assessment of communication patterns might reveal opportunities to better achieve these objectives. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of audio-recorded consultations between surgeons and patients considering high-risk surgery. For 43 surgeons, we randomly selected 4 transcripts each of consultations with patients aged ≥60 y with at least 1 comorbidity. We developed a coding taxonomy, based on principles of informed consent and shared decision making, to categorize surgeon speech. We grouped transcripts by treatment plan and recorded the treatment goal. We used box plots, Sankey diagrams, and flow diagrams to characterize communication patterns. RESULTS: We included 169 transcripts, of which 136 discussed an oncologic problem and 33 considered a vascular (including cardiac and neurovascular) problem. At the median, surgeons devoted an estimated 8 min (interquartile range 5-13 min) to content specifically about intervention including surgery. In 85.5% of conversations, more than 40% of surgeon speech was consumed by technical descriptions of the disease or treatment. ""Fix-it"" language was used in 91.7% of conversations. In 79.9% of conversations, no overall goal of treatment was established or only a desire to cure or control cancer was expressed. Most conversations (68.6%) began with an explanation of the disease, followed by explanation of the treatment in 53.3%, and then options in 16.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Explanation of disease and treatment dominate surgical consultations, with limited time spent on patient goals. Changing the focus of these conversations may better support patients' deliberation about the value of surgery.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02623335. HIGHLIGHTS: In decision-making conversations about high-risk surgical intervention, surgeons emphasize description of the patient's disease and potential treatment, and the use of ""fix-it"" language is common.Surgeons dedicated limited time to eliciting patient preferences and goals, and 79.9% of conversations resulted in no explicit goal of treatment.Current communication practices may be inadequate to support deliberation about the value of surgery for individual patients and their families.",0
Decision Making About Disease-Modifying Treatments for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis: Stated Preferences and Real-World Choices.,"BACKGROUND: People with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis can benefit from disease-modifying treatments (DMTs). Several DMTs are available that vary in their efficacy, side-effect profile and mode of administration. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to measure the preferences of people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis for DMTs using a discrete choice experiment and to assess which stated preference attributes correlate with the attributes of the DMTs they take in the real world. METHODS: Discrete choice experiment attributes were developed from literature reviews, interviews and focus groups. In a discrete choice experiment, participants were shown two hypothetical DMTs, then chose whether they preferred one of the DMTs or no treatment. A mixed logit model was estimated from responses and individual-level estimates of participants' preferences conditional on their discrete choice experiment choices calculated. Logit models were estimated with stated preferences predicting current real-world on-treatment status, DMT mode of administration and current DMT. RESULTS: A stated intrinsic preference for taking a DMT was correlated with currently taking a DMT, and stated preferences for mode of administration were correlated with the modes of administration of the DMTs participants were currently taking. Stated preferences for treatment effectiveness and adverse effects were not correlated with real-world behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: There was variation in which discrete choice experiment attributes correlated with participants' real-world DMT choices. This may indicate patient preferences for treatment efficacy/risk are not adequately taken account of in prescribing. Treatment guidelines must ensure they take into consideration patients' preferences and improve communication around treatment efficacy/risk.",1
Surgical Approach to Bilateral Inguinal Hernia. A Case-Control Study.,"Introduction: Bilateral inguinal hernia can be safely repaired simultaneously, open or minimally invasive, in an elective sce-nario. The choice of surgical approach depends on the patient's status, hernia characteristics, surgeons and patient preferences. Whether age criteria should be considered when selecting between the two approaches is still a matter of debate. Considering that there is no consensus regarding the best repair in bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy, the aim of the study is to perform an analysis regarding elective surgical approach of patients with bilateral inguinal hernias. Material and Methods: To study the relationship between exposure to an open versus laparoscopic approach in patients with bilateral inguinal hernia, we conducted a case-control study. In our retrospective analysis, cases (23 patients) were the open-approach hernia repair, and controls (82 patients) were laparoscopic hernia repair. We analyzed two sets of variables: first, related to patient characteristics (age 65 years, BMI 30 kg/m2, smoking habit, HTA status, COPD status, DM status, use of anticoagulants, presence of neoplastic status) and second, variables related to hernia features (inguinoscrotal hernia, recurrent hernia and complicated hernia). Results: The mean age for cases was 73.26 (Ã+-12.99) years and that of controls, was 56.48 (Ã+-15.15) years. Univariate analysis demonstrated four variables with statistical significance: age 65 years, inguinoscrotal hernia, neo-plastic status, and anticoagulant use. When introduced into the multivariate analysis, we noted that only two variables, age 65 years (OR=4.183, 95% CI [1.289, 13.572], p=0.017) and use of anticoagulants (OR=38.876, 95% CI [1.305, 1158.011], p=0.035) reached statistical significance. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that when we refer to bilateral inguinal hernia repair, patients aged 65 years are at risk of having an open procedure at least fourfold more than patients aged 65 years. In addition, the use of anticoagulants increases the risk of open hernia repair 38 times more than that of minimally invasive repair for the same age group. Interestingly, in our study, hernia characteristics were not found to be associated with open hernia repair and age 65 years. In our study we found that age 65 years is associated with electing open hernia repair over minimally invasive repair, which can be linked to age-related risk factors. Further re-search is needed to investigate the impact of age and age-related risk factors on surgical outcomes of bilateral inguinal hernia repair.",0
Preferences for COVID-19 Vaccination in People With Chronic Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases.,"OBJECTIVE: To understand how people with chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) trade off the benefits and risks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine options. METHODS: We conducted an online discrete-choice experiment in people with IMIDs to quantify the relative importance (RI) of attributes relevant to COVID-19 vaccination. Participants were recruited between May and August 2021 through patient groups and clinics in Canada, and completed 10 choices where they selected 1 of 2 hypothetical vaccine options or no vaccine. The RI of each attribute was estimated and heterogeneity was explored through latent class analysis. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 551 people (89% female, mean age 46 yrs) with a range of IMIDs (inflammatory bowel disease [48%], rheumatoid arthritis [38%], systemic lupus erythematosus [16%]). Most had received 1 (94%) or 2 (64%) COVID-19 vaccinations. Across the ranges of levels considered, vaccine effectiveness was most important (RI = 66%), followed by disease flare (21%), rare but serious risks (9%), and number/timing of injections (4%). Patients would accept a risk of disease flare requiring a treatment change of ≤ 8.8% for a vaccine with a small absolute increase in effectiveness (10%). Of the 3 latent classes, the group with the greatest aversion to disease flare were more likely to be male and have lower incomes, but this group still valued effectiveness higher than other attributes. CONCLUSION: Patients perceived the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination to outweigh rare serious risks and disease flare. This supports COVID-19 vaccine strategies that maximize effectiveness, while recognizing the heterogeneity in preferences that exists.",1
Sequential management of postmenopausal health and osteoporosis: An update.,"Increased life expectancy means that women are now in a hypoestrogenic state for approximately one-third of their lives. Overall health and specifically bone health during this period evolves in accordance with aging and successive exposure to various risk factors. In this review, we provide a summary of the approaches to the sequential management of osteoporosis within an integrative model of care to offer physicians a useful tool to facilitate therapeutic decision-making. Current evidence suggests that pharmacologic agents should be selected based on the risk of fractures, which does not always correlate with age. Due to their effect on bone turnover and on other hormone-regulated phenomena, such as hot flushes or breast cancer risk, we position hormone therapy and selective estrogen receptor modulators as an early postmenopause intervention for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. When the use of these agents is not possible, compelling evidence supports antiresorptive agents as first-line treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in many clinical scenarios, with digestive conditions, kidney function, readiness for compliance, or patient preferences playing a role in choosing between bisphosphonates or denosumab during this period. For patients at high risk of osteoporotic fracture, the ""anabolic first"" approach reduces that risk. The effect on bone health with these bone-forming agents or with denosumab should be consolidated with the subsequent use of antiresorptive agents. Regardless of the strategy, follow-up and treatment should be maintained indefinitely to help prevent fractures.",0
Management strategies for antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction.,"Antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction is one of the most frequently met adverse effects for individuals suffering from major depressive disorder. When primary prevention by non-pharmacological measures fails, empirical coping strategies might be proposed. In this article, we present a brief overview of pharmacological strategies for antidepressant-related sexual dysfunction, considering antidepressants and conceivable corrective medications. We suggest dividing these strategies into three groups: (1) tapering (dose reduction, therapeutic window or short-term treatment interruption); (2) maintenance (focusing on spontaneous remission); (3) optimizing treatment (substitution for another antidepressant or addition of treatments to correct sexual side effects). Whichever strategy is selected, we encourage the clinician to propose the most adequate therapeutic option for the patient, while considering the efficacy and overall tolerance of the current antidepressant strategy, the affected phase of sexuality and patient preferences and gender. This summary is limited to antidepressant treatments and correctors marketed in France and aimed at a clinician reading to help manage patients suffering from antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.",0
Patient Preferences for Cardiac Rehabilitation - A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND: Although a large number of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation(CR), patient preferences for CR remain unclear. Knowing patient preferences may contribute to increasing patient participation and adherence, thus improving patient prognosis. METHODS: A systematic search was carried out using electronic databases and manual reference checks from inception until 15th June 2022. Quantitative studies, qualitative studies and mixed methods studies assessing patient preferences for CR were included. Two researchers independently conducted study selectionand data extraction. CR preferences were divided into three categories: CR settings, CR components, and CR contents. A narrative synthesis was applied to integrate the results of the included studies. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to assess the quality of included studies. RESULTS: Ultimately, 17 publications were included in this study. Regarding CR settings, most patients preferred the hospital to home, some considered both, and a few were willing to accept the local CR club as an alternative setting to the hospital. For CR components, regardless of age and gender, patients considered exercise training and nutrition counseling to be the most important and smoking cessation to be the least important. In exercise intervention of CR contents, progress discussion and encouragement were rated as most critical, and non-conflicting with other activities was rated as least critical. In psychological intervention of CR contents, most patients were willing to accept psychological intervention, and a few patients wanted to heal the trauma with the passage of time. CONCLUSION: This systematic review provides important insights into patient preferences for CR, clarifying patient preferences for CR settings, components, and contents, along with possible influencing factors. Patient preferences may change due to the COVID-19 epidemic, and there is still a need to focus on patient preferences for CR and conduct more relevant primary research to validate the findings of this paper in the future.",1
Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for cholelithiasis 2021.,"The Japanese Society of Gastroenterology first published evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for cholelithiasis in 2010, followed by a revision in 2016. Currently, the revised third edition was published to reflect recent evidence on the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of cholelithiasis conforming to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Following this revision, the present English version of the guidelines was updated and published herein. The clinical questions (CQ) in the previous version were reviewed and rearranged into three newly divided categories: background questions (BQ) dealing with basic background knowledge, CQ, and future research questions (FRQ), which refer to issues that require further accumulation of evidence. Finally, 52 questions (29 BQs, 19 CQs, and 4 FRQs) were adopted to cover the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, complications, and prognosis. Based on a literature search using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Igaku Chuo Zasshi databases for the period between 1983 and August 2019, along with a manual search of new information reported over the past 5 years, the level of evidence was evaluated for each CQ. The strengths of recommendations were determined using the Delphi method by the committee members considering the body of evidence, including benefits and harms, patient preference, and cost-benefit balance. A comprehensive flowchart was prepared for the diagnosis and treatment of gallbladder stones, common bile duct stones, and intrahepatic stones, respectively. The current revised guidelines are expected to be of great assistance to gastroenterologists and general physicians in making decisions on contemporary clinical management for cholelithiasis patients.",0
Exploring older peoples' attitudes and preferences around the use of their healthcare information.,"AIMS: Routinely collected health data can provide rich information for research and epidemiological monitoring of different diseases, but using the data presents many challenges. This study aims to explore the attitudes and preferences of people aged 55 and over regarding the use of their de-identified health data, and their concerns and comfort in different scenarios. METHODS: An anonymous online survey was conducted with people aged 55 and over currently engaged with health services in a New Zealand health district during June-October 2022. The survey could be completed online or by telephone and was available in eight languages. RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of respondents knew that their health information was currently being used in the ways described in the scenarios, and between 80-87% felt comfortable or very comfortable with their data being used as described in the scenarios. In contrast, 4% (n=9) felt ""uncomfortable"" or ""very uncomfortable"" across all of the scenarios. Participants expressed concerns about data accuracy, privacy and confidentiality, security, transparency of use, consent, feedback and the risk of data being sold to commercial companies. Some participants identified situations where permission should be required to link data, including being used by people other than health professionals, containing sensitive health issues, or being used for commercial purposes. CONCLUSION: This study finds general support from patients for the use of their routinely collected data for secondary purposes as long as its use will benefit the population from which the data are taken. It also highlights the necessity of including the perspectives of different cultures in the collection, storage, use and analysis of health information, particularly concerning Māori cultural considerations.",0
Patient preferences and shared decision making for the traditional Chinese medicine treatment of lung cancer: A discrete choice experiment study.,"BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), integrating patient preferences into decision-making process, has been widely used in the multimodality therapy of lung cancer. This study aimed to estimate patient preferences for treatment and shared decision-making (SDM) modes concerning inpatient TCM treatment of lung cancer in Shanghai in order to provide a basis for clinical decision-making process on TCM therapy for lung cancer. METHODS: This study was conducted among patients (n = 347) from nine tertiary hospitals in Shanghai by discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey and Shared Decision-Making Questionnaire-patient version (SDM-Q-9) survey. The DCE was developed with the inclusion of the most relevant attributes at appropriate levels for the TCM treatment of lung cancer. The empirical data analyses of patients were performed using mixed logit models. Additionally, subgroup analysis was conducted. RESULTS: In total, 347 respondents completed the questionnaire. All attributes' coefficients were statistically significant for patients' preferences. Patients showed strong preferences for increasing disease control rate, relieving nausea and vomiting, reducing the risk of side effects, and were concerned about monthly out-of-pocket costs. Subgroup analysis indicated that patients with a lower SDM-Q-9 score and those who were satisfied with medical services emphasized more importance of higher disease control rate. Furthermore, most of the patients (90.20%) self-reported a high willingness to use SDM during the decision-making process. CONCLUSION: In Shanghai, patients mainly preferred SDM and considered disease control rate as the most essential attribute in the TCM treatment of lung cancer. The study findings could underscore the importance of considering patients' preferences and promote SDM.",1
Patient decisions regarding cancer gene panel testing: An exploratory study.,"This study examined factors associated with the selection of a specific multi-gene panel test by patients in a cancer genetic counseling clinic. We surveyed patients who received pre-test genetic counseling at the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Cancer Risk Assessment (CCRA) in 2019 and their genetic counselors to assess demographic and clinical characteristics, patient concerns, and session outcome. Ultimately, 228 eligible participants completed the survey, of whom 85.1% consented to genetic testing. Of those who chose testing, 56.2% selected the largest panel type available, a pan-cancer panel that included both actionable and inactionable genes. White patients were more likely than non-white patients to pursue testing. Among testers, number of testing options offered, participant educational attainment, age, and NCCN Guidelines status were associated with patient choice between four panel options. Some patient concerns, including impact of results on future cancer screening and family dynamics, were also linked to test choice. Several other participant characteristics including income, cancer diagnosis, and family structure did not appear to be predictive of testing choice. Our results confirmed the patient preference for large gene panels and identified a limited number of associations between patient characteristics and concerns and testing choice. We noted however that a significant number of participants did not choose the most commonly selected test, and that test choice is difficult to predict based on clinical and demographic factors. Our results also provide further evidence of well-documented disparities in cancer genetic testing. Study limitations do not allow our findings to be generalized to all cancer genetic counseling patients. Further research is needed to examine how and why patients choose between multiple genetic test options in the cancer setting. This study was one of the first to examine patient choice between a full spectrum of multi-gene panel options.",0
Pretesting Discrete-Choice Experiments: A Guide for Researchers.,"Discrete-choice experiments (DCEs) are a frequently used method to explore the preferences of patients and other decision-makers in health. Pretesting is an essential stage in the design of a high-quality choice experiment and involves engaging with representatives of the target population to improve the readability, presentation, and structure of the preference instrument. The goal of pretesting in DCEs is to improve the validity, reliability, and relevance of the survey, while decreasing sources of bias, burden, and error associated with preference elicitation, data collection, and interpretation of the data. Despite its value to inform DCE design, pretesting lacks documented good practices or clearly reported applied examples. The purpose of this paper is: (1) to define pretesting and describe the pretesting process specifically in the context of a DCE, (2) to present a practical guide and pretesting interview discussion template for researchers looking to conduct a rigorous pretest of a DCE, and (3) to provide an illustrative example of how these resources were operationalized to inform the design of a complex DCE aimed at eliciting tradeoffs between personal privacy and societal benefit in the context of a police method known as investigative genetic genealogy (IGG).",1
Using Patient Preferences in Health Technology Assessment: Evaluating Quality-Adjusted Survival Equivalents (QASE) for the Quantification of Non-health Benefits.,"Interest in using patient preference (PP) data alongside traditional economic models in health technology assessment (HTA) is growing, including using PP data to quantify non-health benefits. However, this is limited by a lack of standardised methods. In this article, we describe a method for using discrete choice experiment (DCE) data to estimate the value of non-health benefits in terms of quality-adjusted survival equivalence (QASE), which is consistent with the concept of value prevalent among HTA agencies. We describe how PP data can be used to estimate QASE, assess the ability to test the face-validity of QASE estimates of changes in mode of administration calculated from five published DCE oncology studies and review the methodological and normative considerations associated with using QASE to support HTA. We conclude that QASE may have some methodological advantages over alternative methods, but this requires DCEs to estimate second-order effects between length and quality of life. In addition, empirical work has yet to be undertaken to substantiate this advantage and demonstrate the validity of QASE. Further work is also required to align QASE with normative objectives of HTA agencies. Estimating QASE would also have implications for the conduct of DCEs, including standardising and defining more clear attribute definitions.",1
