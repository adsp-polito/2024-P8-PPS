Improving methods of clinical practice guidelines: From guidelines to pathways to fast-and-frugal trees and decision analysis to develop individualised patient care.,"BACKGROUND: Current methods for developing clinical practice guidelines have several limitations: they are characterised by the ""black box"" operation-a process with defined inputs and outputs but an incomplete understanding of its internal workings; they have ""the integration problem""-a lack of framework for explicitly integrating factors such as patient preferences and trade-offs between benefits and harms; they generate one recommendation at a time that typically are not connected in a coherent analytical framework; and they apply to ""average"" patients, while clinicians and their patients seek advice tailored to individual circumstances. METHODS: We propose augmenting the current guideline development method by converting evidence-based pathways into fast-and-frugal decision trees (FFTs) and integrating them with generalised decision curve analysis to formulate clear, individualised management recommendations. RESULTS: We illustrate the process by developing recommendations for the management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). We converted evidence-based pathways for HIT, developed by the American Society of Hematology, into an FFT. Here, we consider only thrombotic complications and major bleeding. We leveraged the predictive potential of FFTs to compare the effects of argatroban, bivalirudin, fondaparinux, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) using generalised decision curve analysis. We found that DOACs were superior to other treatments if the FFT-predicted probability of HIT exceeded 3%. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed analytical framework connects guidelines, pathways, FFTs, and decision analysis, offering risk-tailored personalised recommendations and addressing current guideline development critiques.",0
Linking Patients' Goals and Priorities to Recommendations for Medication Changes in a Polypharmacy-Focused Structured Clinical Pathway.,"Polypharmacy is associated with poorer health outcomes in older adults. It is challenging to minimize the harmful effects of medications while maximizing benefits of single-disease-focused recommendations. Integrating patient input can balance these factors. The objectives are to describe the goals, priorities, and preferences of participants asked about these in a structured process to polypharmacy, and to describe the extent that decision-making within the process mapped onto these, signaling a patient-centered approach. This is a single-group quasi-experimental study, nested within a feasibility randomized controlled trial. Patient goals and priorities were mapped to medication recommendations made during the intervention. Overall, there were 33 participants who reported 55 functional goals and 66 symptom priorities, and 16 participants reported unwanted medications. Overall, 154 recommendations for medication alterations occurred. Of those, 68 (44%) recommendations mapped to the individual's goals and priorities, whereas the rest were based on clinical judgment where no priorities were expressed. Our results signal this process supports a patient-centered approach: allowing conversations around goals and priorities in a structured process to polypharmacy should be integrated into subsequent medication decisions.",0
Racial Disparity in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Treatment and Survival in the United States.,"INTRODUCTION: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has a higher incidence and prevalence than esophageal adenocarcinoma among Black individuals in the United States. Black individuals have lower ESCC survival. These racial disparities have not been thoroughly investigated. We examined the disparity in treatment and survival stratified by ESCC stage at diagnosis. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried to identify patients with ESCC between 2000 and 2019. The identified cohort was divided into subgroups by race. Patient and cancer characteristics, treatment received, and survival rates were compared across the racial subgroups. RESULTS: A total of 23,768 patients with ESCC were identified. Compared with White individuals, Black individuals were younger and had more distant disease during diagnosis (distant disease: 26.7% vs 23.8%, P < 0.001). Black individuals had lower age-standardized 5-year survival for localized (survival % [95% confidence interval]: 19.3% [16-22.8] vs 27.6% [25.1-30.2]), regional (14.3% [12-16.7] vs 21.1% [19.6-22.7]), and distant (2.9% [1.9-4.1] vs 6.5% [5.5-7.5]) disease. Black individuals were less likely to receive chemotherapy (54.7% vs 57.5%, P = 0.001), radiation (58.5% vs 60.4%, P = 0.03), and surgery (11.4% vs 16.3%, P < 0.0001). DISCUSSION: Black individuals with ESCC have a lower survival rate than White individuals. This could be related to presenting at a later stage but also disparities in which treatments they receive even among individuals with the same stage of disease. To what extent these disparities in receipt of treatment is due to structural racism, social determinants of health, implicit bias, or patient preferences deserves further study.",0
Development of vaccines for Chagas disease (CRUZIVAX): stakeholders' preferences and potential impacts on healthcare.,"A vaccine for Chagas disease does not currently exist. This study aims to inform the development of two vaccines for the prevention and treatment of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and guide their pre-clinical phase up to clinical phase I. The three main objectives are: 1) to explore patients' and policy makers' preferences on the candidate vaccines in Argentina and Spain; 2) to investigate health-related quality of life of patients affected by Chagas disease; and 3) to assess the potential health provider savings associated with the vaccines, in terms of resource use and health care costs. Discrete choice experiments will be employed to estimate and characterize the theoretical demand for the vaccines and investigate patients' and policy makers' preferences. Health-related quality of life will be assessed using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Resources use and costs associated with Chagas disease will be investigated using information from the databases of the Hospital Clínic of Barcelona.",1
Influence of Self-Reported Health Impairments on German EQ-5D-5L Values.,"OBJECTIVES: The German EQ-5D-5L value set is based on the average preferences of the general population. Nevertheless, in Germany, there is an ongoing debate about the appropriateness of using general population preferences and whether patient preferences should be used instead. Thus, this research aimed to determine the robustness of the German EQ-5D-5L valuation data for the general population compared with those with health impairments. METHODS: Subgroups were built on the self-reported quality of life, measured with the EQ-5D-5L. To identify which groups significantly influenced the value set, different regression models, including dummy variables for the subgroups, were tested while controlling for preference heterogeneity. Backward selection based on the Akaike information criterion led to significant subgroup dummies, which were analyzed in more detail. For each significant subgroup, the value set model was estimated separately. The models were then compared. Sociodemographics of the subgroups were considered. RESULTS: Three significant dummies were identified: state 11111, severity levels 5 to 7, and self-reported problems with pain/discomfort. The value sets for the 6 subgroups were compared with the national German value set, showing only marginal deviations. The mean absolute deviation ranged from 0.004 to 0.013. No different densities were identified for the decrements of the different value sets. CONCLUSIONS: People with self-reported health impairments do not have different EQ-5D-5L health state preferences compared with the German general population. Further research is needed to determine whether the presence of a chronic health condition has a larger influence on health state valuation than the general population.",0
"Trial of labor after cesarean, vaginal birth after cesarean, and the risk of uterine rupture: an expert review.","The decision to pursue a trial of labor after cesarean delivery is complex and depends on patient preference, the likelihood of successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery, assessment of the risks vs benefits of trial of labor after cesarean delivery, and available resources to support safe trial of labor after cesarean delivery at the planned birthing center. The most feared complication of trial of labor after cesarean delivery is uterine rupture, which can have catastrophic consequences, including substantial maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Although the absolute risk of uterine rupture is low, several clinical, historical, obstetrical, and intrapartum factors have been associated with increased risk. It is therefore critical for clinicians managing patients during trial of labor after cesarean delivery to be aware of these risk factors to appropriately select candidates for trial of labor after cesarean delivery and maximize the safety and benefits while minimizing the risks. Caution is advised when considering labor augmentation and induction in patients with a previous cesarean delivery. With established hospital safety protocols that dictate close maternal and fetal monitoring, avoidance of prostaglandins, and careful titration of oxytocin infusion when induction agents are needed, spontaneous and induced trial of labor after cesarean delivery are safe and should be offered to most patients with 1 previous low transverse, low vertical, or unknown uterine incision after appropriate evaluation, counseling, planning, and shared decision-making. Future research should focus on clarifying true risk factors and identifying the optimal approach to intrapartum and induction management, tools for antenatal prediction, and strategies for prevention of uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean delivery. A better understanding will facilitate patient counseling, support efforts to improve trial of labor after cesarean delivery and vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates, and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean delivery.",0
Do Patients Want to Be Involved in Their Carpal Tunnel Surgery Decisions? A Multicenter Study.,"PURPOSE: Carpal tunnel syndrome requires multiple decisions during its management, including regarding preoperative studies, surgical technique, and postoperative wound management. Whether patients have varying preferences for the degree to which they share in decisions during different phases of care has not been explored. The goal of our study was to evaluate the degree to which patients want to be involved along the care pathway in the management of carpal tunnel syndrome. METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter study of patients undergoing carpal tunnel surgery at 5 academic medical centers. Patients received a 27-item questionnaire to rate their preferred level of involvement for decisions made during 3 phases of care for carpal tunnel surgery: preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative. Preferences for participation were quantified using the Control Preferences Scale. These questions were scored on a scale of 0 to 4, with patient-only decisions scoring 0, semiactive decisions scoring 1, equally collaborative decisions scoring 2, semipassive decisions scoring 3, and physician-only decisions scoring 4. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients completed the survey between November 2018 and April 2019. Overall, patients preferred semipassive decisions in all phases of care (median score, 3). Patients preferred equally collaborative decisions for preoperative decisions (median score, 2). Patients preferred a semipassive decision-making role for intraoperative and postoperative decisions (median score, 3), suggesting these did not need to be equally shared. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome prefer varying degrees of involvement in the decision-making process of their care and prefer a semipassive role in intraoperative and postoperative decisions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Strategies to engage patients to varying degrees for all decisions during the management of carpal tunnel syndrome, such as decision aids for preoperative surgical decisions and educational handouts for intraoperative decisions, may facilitate aligning decisions with patient preferences for shared decision-making.",0
Patients' expectations of and experiences with psychosocial care needs in perioperative nursing: a descriptive study.,"BACKGROUND: Meeting inpatients' psychosocial care needs is essential for their wellbeing, recovery, and positive experiences. This study aimed to describe and compare surgical inpatients' subjective perceptions of the importance of fundamental psychosocial and overall care received. METHODS: A descriptive study with a convenient sample was conducted from September 2019 to April 2020. A total of 194 surgical inpatients from Norway and Denmark answered a perioperative user participation questionnaire on the day of discharge. The questionnaire was previously face- and content validated. The questionnaire assessed patients' sociodemographic characteristics and four dimensions of fundamental care domains: Psychosocial, Relational, Physical, and System level. This study reports the results from the psychosocial domain. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations were used to analyze background information variables. The congruency between participants' expectations of and experiences with psychosocial care is presented. RESULTS: The inpatients expected (and experienced) the healthcare personnel to treat them with respect and dignity, and to be involved and informed throughout their perioperative care. The average ratings regarding these aspects of psychosocial care needs were 72.1-93.8%. There was congruency between patients' perceptions of the subjective importance (SI) of psychosocial fundamental care and their perceived reality (PR) of care. Congruency between high SI and high PR ranged from 59.1 to 92.2%, and congruency between low SI and low PR ranged from 0 to 6.6%. Incongruency between SI and PR varied between 5.9 and 39.6% and was mainly related to higher PR than SI. We found no association between education level, sex, length of stay, age, and patient expectations of or experiences with psychosocial care needs. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical inpatients in Norway and Denmark experience respectful and dignified treatment, and they feel involved and informed in their perioperative care. It is important to include patient perspectives in further research to avoid missed care and disconnection between what patients prefer and what healthcare personnel plan to do. Understanding patient preferences might also lead to less stress and workload for healthcare personnel.",0
What types of information do pharmacists include in comprehensive medication management review reports? A qualitative content analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Comprehensive medication management reviews are an established intervention to identify medication-related problems, such as the prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications, and under- and over-prescribing. However, the types of information included in written reports of comprehensive medication management reviews, beyond types of medication-related problems, are unknown. AIM: This study aimed to explore the types of information Australian pharmacists include in their written reports following comprehensive medication management reviews. METHOD: Australian consultant pharmacists were invited to upload their 10 most recent written reports of their domiciliary-based comprehensive medication management reviews. A random selection of the reports, stratified by each pharmacist, were included for qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-two de-identified reports from eight consultant pharmacists located in five of the eight Australian States and Territories were included for analysis. From the evaluated reports, four major categories of information were identified: (1) patient details such as date of interview (n = 72, 100%) and medicine history (n = 70, 97%); (2) pharmacist assessment including assessment of the patient (n = 70, 97%), medicines management (n = 68, 94%) and medicine-related issues (n = 60, 83%); (3) pharmacist recommendations, specifically pharmacological recommendations (n = 67, 93%); and (4) patient-centred experiences such as perspectives on medicines (n = 56, 78%). Reporting of patient-centred experiences appeared most variably in the included reports, including patient concerns (n = 38, 53%), willingness for change (n = 27, 38%), patient preferences (n = 13, 18%), and patient goals (n = 7, 10%). CONCLUSION: Pharmacists within our study included a wide variety of information in their comprehensive medication management review reports. Aside from medication-related problems, pharmacists commonly provided a holistic assessment of the patients they care for. However, variability across reports has the potential to impact consistent service delivery.",0
Rate and reasons for peritoneal dialysis dropout following haemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis switch: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Patient experiences and survival outcomes can be influenced by the circumstances related to dialysis initiation and subsequent modality choices. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the rate and reasons for peritoneal dialysis (PD) dropout following haemodialysis (HD) to PD switch. METHOD: This systematic review conducted searches in four databases, including Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (study ID: CRD42023405718). Outcomes included factors leading to the switch from HD to PD, the rate and reasons for PD dropout and mortality difference in two groups (PD first group versus HD to PD group). The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist and the GRADE tool were used to assess quality. RESULTS: 4971 papers were detected, and 13 studies were included. On meta-analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in PD dropout in the PD first group (OR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.61, 1.09; I(2) = 83%; P = 0.16), however, there was a statistically significant reduction in the rate of mortality (OR: 0.48; 95%CI: 0.25, 0.92; I2 = 73%; P = 0.03) compared to the HD to PD group. The primary reasons for HD to PD switch, included vascular access failure, patient preference, social issues, and cardiovascular disease. Causes for PD dropout differed between the two groups, but inadequate dialysis and peritonitis were the main reasons for PD dropout in both groups. CONCLUSION: Compared to the PD first group, a previous HD history may not impact PD dropout rates for patients, but it could impact mortality in the HD to PD group. The reasons for PD dropout differed between the two groups, with no statistical differences. Psychosocial reasons for PD dropout are valuable to further research. Additionally, establishing a consensus on the definition of PD dropout is crucial for future studies.",0
Non-pharmacological and nonsurgical interventions in male urinary incontinence: A scoping review.,"AIMS: To describe and synthesize non-pharmacological and nonsurgical interventions for male urinary incontinence from the existing literature. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the methodology suggested by Arksey and O'Malley: (1) identification of the research questions; (2) identification of relevant studies using a three-step search recommended by JBI: an initial search within PubMed and CINAHL, a comprehensive literature search within PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and literature search of references lists; (3) study selection; (4) data extraction and charting; (5) collation, summarization, and reporting of the results. The PRISMA-ScR Checklist was used to report. RESULTS: A total of 4602 studies were identified, of which 87 studies were included. Approximately 78% were randomized controlled trials. More than 88% of the participants were men with prostate cancer. Exercising pelvic floor muscles 30 times per day for 12 weeks was the most frequently reported. Parameters of electrical stimulation were typically set up to 50 Hz and 300 μs for frequency and width of pulse, respectively, and lasted for 15 min. Pure pelvic floor muscle training, Pilates, Yoga, whole body vibration, diaphragm/abdominal muscle training, micturition interruption exercise, acupuncture, and auriculotherapy showed positive effects on reducing urinary incontinence. CONCLUSION: The findings suggested implementing pelvic floor muscle training alone before or after surgery can both prompt the recovery of continence in men after prostate cancer surgery. The decision to use biofeedback or electrical stimulation to enhance the therapeutic effect of pelvic floor muscle training should be approached with caution. More rigorous designed studies are needed to validate the effectiveness of Traditional Chinese Medicine techniques and diverse novel methods. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Physicians and nurses need to be up to date on the latest evidence-based non-pharmacological and nonsurgical interventions in male urinary incontinence and select appropriate interventions based on available medical resources and patient preferences.",0
A multidisciplinary consensus statement on the optimal pharmacological treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). The addition of docetaxel or new hormone therapies (abiraterone, apalutamide, or enzalutamide) improves overall survival and is currently the standard of care. However, the decision on the specific regimen to accompany ADT should be discussed with the patient, considering factors such as possible associated toxicities, duration of treatment, comorbidities, patient preferences, as there is no sufficient evidence to recommend one regimen over the other in most cases. This paper summarizes the evidence on the management of mHSPC and provides consensus recommendations on the optimal treatment in combination with ADT in mHSPC patients, with special attention to the patient's clinical profile.",0
Evaluating the impact of interprofessional training wards on patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes: a mixed-methods analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: Interprofessional teamwork is pivotal in modern healthcare, prompting the establishment of interprofessional training wards since 1996. While these wards serve as hubs for optimizing healthcare professional collaboration and communication, research into patient outcomes remains notably sparse and geographically limited, predominantly examining patient satisfaction and sparingly exploring other metrics like mortality or self-discharge rates. This study seeks to bridge this gap, comparing patient outcomes in interprofessional training wards and conventional wards under the hypothesis that the former offers no disadvantage to patient outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We explored patient outcomes within an interprofessional student ward called A-STAR at a University Hospital from October 2019 to December 2022. Engaging with patients discharged between May 2021 and April 2022, we utilized digital and paper-based anonymous questionnaires, catering to patient preference, to gather pertinent data. RESULTS: Analysis of outcomes for 1,482 A-STAR (interprofessional student ward) and 5,752 conventional ward patients revealed noteworthy findings. A-STAR patients tended to be younger (59 vs. 61 years, p < 0.01) and more frequently male (73.5% vs. 70.4%, p = 0.025). Vital clinical outcomes, such as discharges against medical advice, complication-driven readmissions, and ICU transfers, were statistically similar between groups, as were mortality rates (1.2% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.468). A-STAR demonstrated high patient satisfaction, underscored by positive reflections on team competence, ward atmosphere, and responsiveness to concerns, emphasizing the value placed on interprofessional collaboration. Patient narratives commended team kindness, lucid explanations, and proactive involvement. DISCUSSION: This data collectively underscores the safety and reliability of patient care within training wards, affirming that patients can trust the care provided in these settings. Patients on the interprofessional ward demonstrated high satisfaction levels: 96.7% appreciated the atmosphere and conduct of ward rounds. In comparison, 98.3% were satisfied with the discussion and information about their treatment during their hospital stay.",0
Differences in Preferences for Drug Therapy Between Patients with Metastatic Versus Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Systematic Literature Review.,"INTRODUCTION: Compared with early stages (eBC) metastatic BC (mBC) is incurable. In mBC, aggressive treatment may increase the duration of survival but may also cause severe treatment side effects. A better understanding how patients with BC value different aspects of drug therapy might improve treatment effectiveness, satisfaction and adherence. This systematic review aims to identify and summarise studies evaluating patient preferences for drug therapy of BC and to compare preferences of patients with eBC and mBC. METHODS: The systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The electronic databases PubMed and Web of Science were searched on 22 June 2023. All studies published to this point were considered. Original studies reporting patient preferences on BC drug therapy determined by any type of choice experiment were eligible. A narrative synthesis of the effect measures presented as relative importance ratings, trade-offs (required benefit to make a therapy worthwhile) or monetary values of the treatment attributes was reported for each study. Risk of bias assessment for individual studies was performed using the checklist for observational studies from the STROBE Statement and the checklist from 'Conducting Discrete Choice Experiments to Inform Healthcare Decision Making: A User's Guide'. The study protocol was registered at the PROSPERO database (CRD42022377031). RESULTS: A total of 34 studies met the inclusion criteria were included in the analysis evaluating the preferences of patients with eBC (n = 18), mBC (n = 10) or any stage BC (n = 6) on, for example, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, hormonal therapy or CKD4/6-inhibitors using different types of choice experiments. Regardless of the stage, most patients valued treatment effectiveness in terms of survival gains higher than potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Treatment cost, mode of administration, treatment regimen and monitoring aspects were considered as least important treatment attributes. In addition, preferences concerning 16 different types of ADRs were described, showing high heterogeneity within BC stages. Yet, comparable results across BC stages were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the stage, patients with BC consistently valued survival gains as the most important attribute and were willing to accept the risk of potential ADRs. Incorporating patient preferences in shared decision making may improve the effectiveness of interventions by enhancing adherence to drug therapy in patients suffering from BC.",1
Treatment preferences towards thrombopoietin-receptor agonists for immune thrombocytopenia and experience of disease (TRAPeze): Italy cohort.,"OBJECTIVE: Identify patient preference towards thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) and determine the clinical and social impact of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in Italy. METHODS: The Thrombopoietin-Receptor Agonist Patient experience (TRAPeze) survey collected responses from Italian residents from 17th January to 28th February 2022. TRAPeze utilized a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit patient preferences towards TPO-RA attributes and a patient burden survey (PBS) to determine ITP disease characteristics and social impact. RESULTS: Seventy-six respondents completed the DCE, of which 69 completed both the DCE and PBS (mean [range] age 45 [18.0-73.0] years, 80% female). TPO-RA attributes with the greatest influence over respondent choice were method of administration (odds ratio [OR] 2.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.16-4.06), drug-food interactions (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.17-1.86) and frequency of dosing (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.15-1.52). Respondents were more likely to prefer therapies administered orally over subcutaneous injection (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.51-5.63), once weekly over once daily (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.26-2.65), and therapies without food restrictions over with restrictions (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.17-2.14).The most frequently reported symptoms were bruising (82%), petechiae (65%) and fatigue (64%). Most respondents (84%) felt ITP impacted familial relationships and 71% of employed respondents reported fatigue influencing their ability to work, with 31% reducing working hours. CONCLUSION: Although responses indicated a moderate perception of general health, ITP clearly impacted respondent work and social life. Our findings demonstrate respondents preferred TPO-RAs delivered orally, with less frequent dosing and without food restrictions.",1
How Physicians Tackle Internet-Misinformed Patients: Going Beyond Traditional Patient-Centered Communication - A Study Protocol.,"BACKGROUND: The proliferation of misleading and irrelevant health information on the Internet has become a significant public concern. Inappropriate use of online materials can cause harm to patients' health and quality of life. While close attention has been paid to health campaigns and education programs that aim to disseminate accurate health knowledge, the role of physicians, who directly communicate with patients in medical encounters and provide personalized information, has been overlooked. Therefore, this study focuses on physicians and their communication strategies with internet-misinformed patients (IMPs). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the communicative strategies physicians use to tackle IMPs and explore connections between physicians' communicative strategies and patient-centered communication. METHODS: Approximately 10 to 15 physicians from diverse cultural backgrounds, including Ticino (an Italian-speaking region in Switzerland), Milan and China will be interviewed. Interviews will be conducted in-person or online through video conferencing software programs. Physicians will be asked about their experiences with IMPs, communicative strategies for addressing patients' misconceptions, balancing patient preferences, decision-making obstacles, and envisioning an ideal relationship with them. A thematic analysis will be utilized to analyze data, employing a general inductive approach. DISCUSSION: The results will provide valuable insights into effective clinical communication strategies that address patients' misuse of internet materials and inform policymakers and healthcare providers about the limitations and applicability of patient-centered communication in the current digital era.",0
Describing settings of care in the last 100 days of life for cancer decedents: a population-based descriptive study.,"BACKGROUND: Few studies have described the settings cancer decedents spend their end-of-life stage, with none considering homecare specifically. We describe the different settings of care experienced in the last 100 days of life by individuals with cancer and how settings of care change as they approached death. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study from January 2013 to December 2017, of decedents whose primary cause of death was cancer, using linked population-level health administrative datasets in Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: Decedents 125,755 were included in our cohort. The average age at death was 73, 46% were female, and 14% resided in rural regions. And 24% died of lung cancer, 7% breast, 7% colorectal, 7% pancreatic, 5% prostate, and 50% other cancers. In the last 100 days of life, decedents spent 25.9 days in institutions, 25.8 days receiving care in the community, and 48.3 days at home without any care. Individuals who died of lung and pancreatic cancers spent the most days at home without any care (52.1 and 52.6 days), while individuals who died of prostate and breast cancer spent the least days at home without any care (41.6 and 45.1 days). Regardless of cancer type, decedents spent fewer days at home and more days in institutions as they approached death, despite established patient preferences for an end-of-life experience at home. CONCLUSIONS: In the last 100 days of life, cancer decedents spent most of their time in either institutions or at home without any care. Improving homecare services during the end-of-life may provide people dying of cancer with a preferred dying experience.",0
Roadmap for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension in the Middle East: Review of the 2022 EVIDENT Summit.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension are leading risk factors for death and disability in the Middle East. Both conditions are highly prevalent, underdiagnosed and poorly controlled, highlighting an urgent need for a roadmap to overcome the barriers to optimal glycaemic and blood pressure management in this region. This review provides a summary of the Evidence in Diabetes and Hypertension Summit (EVIDENT) held in September 2022, which discussed current treatment guidelines, unmet clinical needs and strategies to improve treatment outcomes for patients with T2DM and hypertension in the Middle East. Current clinical guidelines recommend strict glycaemic and blood pressure targets, presenting several treatment options to achieve and maintain these targets and prevent complications. However, treatment targets are infrequently met in the Middle East, largely due to high clinical inertia among physicians and low medication adherence among patients. To address these challenges, clinical guidelines now provide individualised therapy recommendations based on drug profiles, patient preferences and management priorities. Efforts to improve the early detection of prediabetes, T2DM screening and intensive, early glucose control will minimise long-term complications. Physicians can use the T2DM Oral Agents Fact Checking programme to help navigate the wide range of treatment options and guide clinical decision-making. Sulfonylurea agents have been used successfully to manage T2DM; a newer agent, gliclazide MR (modified release formulation), has the advantages of a lower incidence of hypoglycaemia with no risk of cardiovascular events, weight neutrality and proven renal benefits. For patients with hypertension, single-pill combinations have been developed to improve efficacy and reduce treatment burden. In conjunction with pragmatic treatment algorithms and personalised therapies, greater investments in disease prevention, public awareness, training of healthcare providers, patient education, government policies and research are needed to improve the quality of care of patients with T2DM and/or hypertension in the Middle East.",0
The role of topical therapies along the psoriasis patient journey: An overview from the Symposium 'Tailoring topical psoriasis treatments to patients' needs and expectations' of the 30(th) EADV Congress 2021.,"This article summarizes a presentation titled 'The role of topical therapies along the psoriasis patient journey' held at the Satellite Symposium of the 30(th) European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress. During this session, the role of topical treatments in the management of psoriasis was presented, with a particular focus on the current unmet needs and data gaps. Psoriasis plays a significant role in a patient's daily life, impacting them not only physically but also psychologically and socially. The disease burden increases with duration and severity. Topical therapies are the keystone of the management of psoriasis. About 70%-80% of patients present a mild-to-moderate form of psoriasis that can be successfully treated with topical agents. According to a German recommendation, patients with mild psoriasis should initiate a topical therapy in combination with skin care products. In the real-life setting, the calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (CAL/BDP) fixed combination was the most prescribed topical treatment for beyond-mild patients in Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. Healthcare professionals also often or very often prescribed topicals as an alternative to non-biologic systemics in certain situations, such as patient preference (51%), contraindication (50%) and to limit side effects (26%). Adjunctive topical therapy to patients using systemic therapy is used to optimize treatment outcomes and improving the quality of life for patients. Topical treatments can be also effective in severe forms of psoriasis. However, there are still some gaps and unmet needs on topical therapy. Ineffectiveness, patient dissatisfaction and adherence are the largest barriers to treatment success. Main strengths of topical treatments include the availability of various topical ingredients and galenics, the adaptability to different anatomical areas and the possible combination with phototherapy and systemics. Moreover, patients in specific situations can benefit from switching to topical treatments (e.g. pregnancy or surgery).",0
Preferences of pregnant individuals to undergo labor after one cesarean in southern China.,"BACKGROUND: Labor after cesarean (LAC) remains an optional delivery method among healthy pregnant individuals. Exploring women's attitudes, preferences, reasons for previous cesarean delivery, and the incentives underlying pregnant individuals' preferences could help us understand their choice of delivery mode. In this study we evaluated the preferences and attitudes of eligible pregnant women regarding participation in a LAC in Foshan, China. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 438 pregnant individuals with one prior cesarean delivery (CD) who attended their antenatal examination at a tertiary hospital in southern China, between November 1, 2018, and October 31, 2019. Information on demographic characteristics, obstetric data, preferences for LAC, and incentives for LAC were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 85.4% (374/438) of women preferred LAC if they did not have contraindications before delivery, whereas 12.3% (54/438) refused and 2.3% (10/438) were unsure. Participants reported that the most important factors affecting their willingness to undergo LAC were safety indicators (i.e., ""ability of hospitals to perform emergency cesarean delivery"" [score of 9.28 ± 1.86]), followed by accessibility indicators (i.e., ""priority bed arrangements"" [score of 9.17 ± 1.84]). Logistic regression analysis indicated that neonatal wellbeing with the prior CD was an independent influencing factor (OR = 2.235 [95%CI: 1.115-4.845], p = 0.024) affecting willingness to access LAC in the subsequent pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high preference for LAC among pregnant individuals without contraindications before delivery in southern China. Healthcare providers need to ensure access to LAC and increase pregnant individuals' LAC willingness through high-quality shared decsision-making in alignment with patient preferences.",0
A qualitative study of teleconsultation practices among French oncologists in a post-COVID-19 period.,"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic has prompted healthcare professionals to adapt and implement new tools to ensure continuity of patient care. Teleconsultation became the only option for some practitioners who had never used it previously and boosted its use for others who already used it. Several studies have reviewed the use of teleconsultation in oncology during the epidemic, but few have addressed its continued use and how practitioners view it in a post-epidemic period. The aim of this survey was to conduct a qualitative exploration of how oncologists use teleconsultation in their daily practice in a post-COVID 19 period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this qualitative study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with oncologists in France who utilized teleconsultation in the field of oncology during the COVID-19 period. The interview guide included questions on the interests and limitations of using teleconsultation in oncology, on reluctance to use it among oncologists, and invited participants to formulate proposals for more optimal use. RESULTS: Fourteen oncologists participated in the survey. Currently, 12% of the consultations of the surveyed practitioners are conducted via teleconsultation. Seven themes were identified in the analysis of the interviews: (a) The oncologist and teleconsultation; (b) Clinical motivations for using teleconsultation; (c) Comparison between teleconsultation and in-person consultation; (d) Advantages and disadvantages of teleconsultation; (e) Technical modalities of teleconsultation; (f) Role of Covid and confinement in the use of teleconsultation; (h) Epistemic judgments about teleconsultation. Optimal teleconsultation occurs when seamlessly incorporated into patient care, offering reduced patient inconvenience, and providing economic and environmental benefits. Although there's a lack of unified agreement in research literature regarding time efficiency, teleconsultation facilitates more customized patient monitoring and addresses the challenge of ""medical deserts"" nationally. Considering patient preferences is crucial when contemplating the use of teleconsultation. Predominantly, technical issues stand as the principal barriers to teleconsultation implementation. CONCLUSION: Even after the end of the health crisis, teleconsultation is still used in clinical practice. Recommendations for effective use are suggested.",0
Understanding Intraoperative Transfusion Decision-Making Variability: A Qualitative Study.,"There is evidence of significant intraoperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion variability that cannot be explained by case-mix, and may reflect unwarranted transfusions. The objective was to explore the source of intraoperative RBC transfusion variability by eliciting the beliefs of anesthesiologists and surgeons that underlie transfusion decisions. Interviews based on the Theoretical Domains Framework were conducted to identify beliefs about intraoperative transfusion. Content analysis was performed to group statements into domains. Relevant domains were selected based on frequency of beliefs, perceived influence on transfusion, and the presence of conflicting beliefs within domains. Of the 28 transfusion experts recruited internationally (16 anesthesiologists, 12 surgeons), 24 (86%) were Canadian or American and 11 (39%) identified as female. Eight relevant domains were identified: (1) Knowledge (insufficient evidence to guide intraoperative transfusion), (2) Social/professional role and identity (surgeons/anesthesiologists share responsibility for transfusions), (3) Beliefs about consequences (concerns about morbidity of transfusion/anemia), (4) Environmental context/resources (transfusions influenced by type of surgery, local blood supply, cost of transfusion), (5) Social influences (institutional culture, judgment by peers, surgeon-anesthesiologist relationship, patient preference influencing transfusion decisions), (6) Behavioral regulation (need for intraoperative transfusion guidelines, usefulness of audits and educational sessions to guide transfusion), (7) Nature of the behaviors (overtransfusion remains commonplace, transfusion practice becoming more restrictive over time), and (8) Memory, attention, and decision processes (various patient and operative characteristics are incorporated into transfusion decisions). This study identified a range of factors underlying intraoperative transfusion decision-making and partly explain the variability in transfusion behavior. Targeted theory-informed behavior-change interventions derived from this work could help reduce intraoperative transfusion variability.",0
Sequencing Systemic Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Multiple treatment options are now approved for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-containing regimen should be highly considered as the first-line treatment when there is no contraindication, especially in those with hepatitis virus-related HCC, due to proven superior overall survival (OS) compared to sorafenib. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab remain the treatment of choice among all ICI-containing regimens, unless contraindications to either of the medications exist. Although sorafenib is still the only medication currently approved for select patients with Child-Pugh B (CP) HCC in the first-line setting, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab is being studied in this patient population. Moreover, patients with post-liver transplantation recurrence may benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), while more studies are still needed to determine the safety of ICIs in this setting. Interestingly, multiple potential biomarkers, including tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI) status, and PD-L1 expression level, have inconsistently predicted response to ICIs in patients with HCC. Limited evidence is available to guide treatment choice in later-line settings after progressing on ICIs, and decisions should be based on the safety profile of the treatment regimen and patient preference. Multiple trials are ongoing to elucidate the optimal treatment sequence. Of note, we believe that TKIs (e.g., cabozantinib, regorafenib, lenvatinib, and sorafenib) could be more beneficial in later-line settings to broaden inhibition of other pathways apart from vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). When conventional treatment options are exhausted, tissue biopsy may be helpful to reveal rare targetable mutations, such as RET gene fusions.",0
Toenail Onychomycosis with or without Diabetes in Canada: Patient Treatment Preferences and Health State Utilities.,"BACKGROUND: Toenail onychomycosis affects approximately 6.7% of Canadians. Symptoms include nail discolouration/disfiguration and pain; psychosocial impacts contribute to reduced health-related quality-of-life. Comorbid diabetes increases the risk of complications and exacerbates burden. Treatment may include topical therapy and/or oral agents. PURPOSE: To understand toenail onychomycosis treatment preferences, and to quantify the impact of toenail onychomycosis, with or without diabetes, on patient well-being. METHODS: Adults living in Canada with self-reported, physician-diagnosed, toenail onychomycosis were recruited online. A discrete choice experiment was used to quantify treatment preferences. Scenarios were randomized; data were analyzed using conditional logit regression. Health state utilities were estimated using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3(®). Results were stratified by diabetes status and toenail onychomycosis severity; the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used to assess between-group utility differences. RESULTS: Three-hundred thirteen participants with toenail onychomycosis were included (161 had comorbid diabetes; 61.3%, severe onychomycosis). The mean age was 57.7 years; 55.9% were male. Treatment attributes with statistically significant impacts on patient preferences were efficacy (odds ratio [OR],1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.05 per 1% increased treatment success), administration method (one pill versus topical nail lacquer reference, 1.14; 1.04-1.26; topical solution applicator versus reference: 1.15; 1.03-1.29), severe adverse events (0.85; 0.80-0.90 per 1% increased risk), and risk of potential pharmacodynamic (0.80; 0.76-0.85) and alcohol (0.93; 0.88-0.98) interactions; preferences were more pronounced for efficacy and avoiding severe adverse events among toenail onychomycosis patients with comorbid diabetes. The mean (95% CI) utility value was 0.73 (0.70-0.75) overall, and statistically significantly lower (p=0.02) for toenail onychomycosis patients with diabetes (0.70; CI, 0.66-0.73) than those without (0.76; CI, 0.72-0.79). CONCLUSION: Among patients with toenail onychomycosis, the presence of diabetes was associated with differing treatment-related preferences. Utility values for patients with toenail onychomycosis represent a significant decline from full health that is exacerbated by comorbid diabetes.",1
Patient-related outcomes of conventional impression making versus intraoral scanning for prosthetic rehabilitation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Intraoral scanning has been reported to be preferred by patients over conventional impression making. Nevertheless, information regarding patient-related outcomes for conventional impression making and digital scanning is sparse. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze patient-related outcomes of intraoral scanning and conventional impression methods. The primary outcomes evaluated were patient preference and satisfaction, and the secondary outcomes discomfort, nausea, unpleasant taste, breathing difficulty, pain, and anxiety. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic and manual searches were performed for clinical trials that evaluated patient-related outcomes for intraoral scanning and conventional impression making for prosthetic rehabilitation. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa scale were used to assess the quality of the studies. Random-effects models using mean difference were used for meta-analyses. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran Q test and I(2) statistics (α=.05). RESULTS: The search strategy identified 1626 articles, and 11 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Patients preferred intraoral scanning to conventional impression making. The mean difference for patient preference was 15.02 (95% confidence interval of 8.33 - 21.73; P<.001). Discomfort, absence of nausea, absence of unpleasant taste, and absence of breathing difficulty were also significantly different (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoral scanning is a suitable alternative to conventional impression procedures, promoting less discomfort for patients sensitive to taste, nausea, and breathing difficulty than when conventional impression making techniques are used.",0
What drives researcher preferences for chemical compounds? Evidence from conjoint analysis.,"We investigated the attributes and attribute levels that affect researcher preferences for chemical compounds. We conducted a conjoint analysis on survey data of Korean researchers using chemical compounds from the Korean Chemical Bank (KCB). The analysis estimated the part-worth utility for each attribute's level, calculated relative importance of attributes, and classified user segmentation with different patterns. The results show that the structure database offers the highest part-worth utility to researchers, followed by high new functionality, price, screening service, and drug action data provided only by the KCB. Notably, researchers view the offer of a structured database and high new functionality as more important than other attributes in decision-making about research and development of chemical compounds. Furthermore, the results of segmentation analysis demonstrated that researchers have distinct usage patterns of chemical compounds: researchers consider structure database and high new functionality in cluster 1; and high new functionality and price in cluster 2, to be the most appealing. We discussed some policy and strategic implications based on the findings of this study and proposed some limitations.",0
"Preferences for preventive treatments for rheumatoid arthritis: discrete choice survey in the UK, Germany and Romania.","OBJECTIVE: To quantify preferences for preventive therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) across three countries. METHODS: A web-based survey including a discrete choice experiment was administered to adults recruited via survey panels in the UK, Germany and Romania. Participants were asked to assume they were experiencing arthralgia and had a 60% chance of developing RA in the next 2 years and completed 15 choices between no treatment and two hypothetical preventive treatments. Treatments were defined by six attributes (effectiveness, risks and frequency/route of administration) with varying levels. Participants also completed a choice task with fixed profiles reflecting subjective estimates of candidate preventive treatments. Latent class models (LCMs) were conducted and the relative importance of attributes, benefit-risk trade-offs and predicted treatment uptake was subsequently calculated. RESULTS: Completed surveys from 2959 participants were included in the analysis. Most participants preferred treatment over no treatment and valued treatment effectiveness to reduce risk more than other attributes. A five-class LCM best fitted the data. Country, perceived risk of RA, health literacy and numeracy predicted class membership probability. Overall, the maximum acceptable risk for a 40% reduction in the chance of getting RA (60% to 20%) was 21.7%, 19.1% and 2.2% for mild side effects, serious infection and serious side effects, respectively. Predicted uptake of profiles reflecting candidate prevention therapies differed across classes. CONCLUSION: Effective preventive pharmacological treatments for RA were acceptable to most participants. The relative importance of treatment attributes and likely uptake of fixed treatment profiles were predicted by participant characteristics.",1
Development of a discrete choice experiment questionnaire to elicit preferences by pregnant women and policymakers for the expansion of non-invasive prenatal screening.,"OBJECTIVE: An instrument for measuring intervention preferences applicable to both patients and policymakers would make it possible to better confront the needs of the supply and demand sides of the health care system. This study aimed to develop a discrete choice experiments (DCE) questionnaire to elicit the preferences of patients and policymakers. The instrument was specifically developed to estimate preferences for new conditions to be added to a screening program for fetal chromosomal anomalies. METHODS: A DCE development study was conducted. The methods employed included a literature review, a qualitative study (based on individual semi-structured interviews, consultations, and a focus group discussion) with pregnant women and policymakers, and a pilot project with 33 pregnant women to validate the first version of the instrument and test the feasibility of its administration. RESULTS: An initial list of 10 attributes was built based on a literature review and the qualitative research components of the study. Five attributes were built based on the responses provided by the participants from both groups. Eight attributes were consensually retained. A pilot project performed on 33 pregnant women led to a final instrument containing seven attributes: 'conditions to be screened', 'test performance', 'moment at gestational age to obtain the test result', 'degree of test result certainty to the severity of the disability', 'test sufficiency', 'information provided from test result', and 'cost related to the test'. CONCLUSION: It is possible to reach a consensus on the construction of a DCE instrument intended to be administered to pregnant women and policymakers. However, complete validation of the consensual instrument is limited because there are too few voting members of health technology assessment agencies committees to statistically ascertain the relevance of the attributes and their levels.",1
Eliciting Depression Patients' Preferences for Medication Management: A Protocol for Discrete Choice Experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Depression threatens people's lives and imposes huge economic burden. Antidepressant therapy is the first-line treatment for depression, and patient adherence to medication is the key to successful treatment. Depression patients have poor medication adherence, which leads to failure of depression management and significantly poorer clinical outcomes. Incorporating patient preferences into clinical decisions can improve uptake rates, optimize treatment adherence. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) can elicit and quantify individual preferences. Previous DCE studies were conducted in developed countries and ignored the influences of factors other than the medication. This paper outlines an ongoing DCE that aims to (1) explore medication-management-related characteristics that may affect depression patients' adherence to antidepressant, (2) elicit how depression patients consider the trade-offs among different medication managements. METHODS: The six attributes and their levels were developed through a literature review, semi-structured interviews and experts and focus group discussions. A fractional factorial design in the software Ngene 1.2 version was used to generate 36 choice sets, and they were divided into 3 blocks. A mixed logit model will be used to explore the patients' preferences, willingness to pay and uptake rate of depression patients for medication management attributes. RESULTS: The final questionnaire consists of three parts. The first is the introduction, which introduces the purpose of the study and the requirements of completing the questionnaire. This was followed by a general information questionnaire, which included sociodemographic characteristics. The last part is DCE tasks, which include 13 DCE choice sets, and each choice set include two alternative and one ""opt-out"" option. The pilot-test results showed the questionnaire was easy to understand and could be used in formal surveys. CONCLUSION: Our study shows how the development process of the study can be conducted and reported systematically and rigorously according to the theoretical foundation and design principles in DCE.",1
[Patient Preferences for Exercise Therapy in People with Severe Mental Illness in Germany].,"PURPOSE: Assessing the experience with and the attitudes towards exercise therapy in persons with severe mental illness (SMI). Furthermore, potential variables of high preference towards exercise therapy are investigated. METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study of SMI patients aged between 18 and 65 years (n=385). Patients were interviewed by trained staff using standardised instruments. Potential variables were analysed using a hierarchic binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: 84,4% of SMI patients had a high preference for exercise therapy; of these, 44,1% exercised regularly. Among patients with severe mental illness especially a higher value in the GAF-assessment (p=0,041) and living in a metropolitan area (p=0,011) predict a high preference for exercise therapy. CONCLUSION: Most of the patients with severe mental illness interviewed in this study place a surprisingly high value on sports and exercise therapy. Due to the increasing evidence with regard to positive effects of these therapies, it may be an excellent starting point to expand sports and exercise therapy as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. At the same time, strategies for everyday transfer need to be implemented more rigorously.",0
"Protocol of the Comparison of Intravesical Therapy and Surgery as Treatment Options (CISTO) study: a pragmatic, prospective multicenter observational cohort study of recurrent high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.","BACKGROUND: Bladder cancer poses a significant public health burden, with high recurrence and progression rates in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Current treatment options include bladder-sparing therapies (BST) and radical cystectomy, both with associated risks and benefits. However, evidence supporting optimal management decisions for patients with recurrent high-grade NMIBC remains limited, leading to uncertainty for patients and clinicians. The CISTO (Comparison of Intravesical Therapy and Surgery as Treatment Options) Study aims to address this critical knowledge gap by comparing outcomes between patients undergoing BST and radical cystectomy. METHODS: The CISTO Study is a pragmatic, prospective observational cohort trial across 36 academic and community urology practices in the US. The study will enroll 572 patients with a diagnosis of recurrent high-grade NMIBC who select management with either BST or radical cystectomy. The primary outcome is health-related quality of life (QOL) at 12 months as measured with the EORTC-QLQ-C30. Secondary outcomes include bladder cancer-specific QOL, progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and financial toxicity. The study will also assess patient preferences for treatment outcomes. Statistical analyses will employ targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) to address treatment selection bias and confounding by indication. DISCUSSION: The CISTO Study is powered to detect clinically important differences in QOL and cancer-specific survival between the two treatment approaches. By including a diverse patient population, the study also aims to assess outcomes across the following patient characteristics: age, gender, race, burden of comorbid health conditions, cancer severity, caregiver status, social determinants of health, and rurality. Treatment outcomes may also vary by patient preferences, health literacy, and baseline QOL. The CISTO Study will fill a crucial evidence gap in the management of recurrent high-grade NMIBC, providing evidence-based guidance for patients and clinicians in choosing between BST and radical cystectomy. The CISTO study will provide an evidence-based approach to identifying the right treatment for the right patient at the right time in the challenging clinical setting of recurrent high-grade NMIBC.

Values Assessment Tools in Advanced Cancer: A Clinical Literature Review.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced cancer may receive cancer treatment that does not reflect their values because they may not be completely aware of what is important to them regarding treatment-related decisions when they are diagnosed. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review was to determine whether existing values assessment tools can improve awareness of treatment-related decisional values in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: PubMed®, CINAHL®, and PsycINFO® databases were searched for original English-language articles evaluating values assessment tools that could be used to assess patients with advanced cancer. The quality of the identified tools was evaluated using selected International Patient Decision Aid Standards instrument, version 3.0, criteria. FINDINGS: All tools identified are appropriate for use in patients with advanced cancer. Two scored at least 80% on the selected International Patient Decision Aid Standards criteria. The Short Graphic Values History Tool was developed with patient and clinician input and may be particularly useful for low-literacy patient populations with advanced cancer. No values assessment tools have been identified specifically for use in patients with advanced cancer.",0

Non-insulin Medications for the Management of Type 2 Diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is predicted to affect 366 million people over the age of 65 years by the year 2030. As the understanding of the core defects associated with T2D advanced, researchers recognized management should target multiple defects in glucose metabolism. As a result, efforts to manage T2D focus on developing new drug therapies aimed at addressing each of the identified metabolic defects. Optimal treatment of T2D is necessary to decrease the risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, and vascular diseases. This article discusses non-insulin pharmacologic treatments for T2D that are guided by glycemic efficacy, safety profiles, effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk, tolerability, patient comorbidities, route of administration, patient preference, and cost.",0
Ethical Aspects of Prodromal Synucleinopathy Prognostic Counseling.,"Alpha-synucleinopathies can be identified in their prodromal phase, raising several ethical issues. In this review, we first provide definitions of prodromal α-synucleinopathies and discuss the importance of distinguishing between prodromes and risk factors. Next, we discuss the implications of a diagnosis of prodromal α-synucleinopathy and considerations regarding prognostic counseling in both clinical and research settings. We review available data on patient preferences regarding disclosure as well as providers' perspectives. We examine the pros and cons of disclosing a diagnosis of prodromal α-synucleinopathy, taking into consideration the differences between clinical and research settings. Asking about willingness to know in clinical and research settings and the shared decision-making process applied to prognostic counseling is discussed. Concerning research settings, ethical aspects regarding clinical trials are addressed. Availability of direct-to-consumer technologies will likely lead to novel contexts requiring prognostic counseling, and future neuroprotective or neuromodulating treatments may require further considerations on the timing, role, and importance of prognostic counseling. Recommendations on how to address ethical gaps should be a priority for patients, medical professional societies, and research workgroups. Ethical issues must be considered as an integral part of the overall clinical and research approach to prodromal synucleinopathies.",0
Attitudes towards disposition of cryopreserved sperm in the event of death.,"INTRODUCTION: To evaluate patient preference for sperm disposition in case of death based on demographic factors and infertility etiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed at a university hospital-affiliated fertility center. Charts of 550 men undergoing cryopreservation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) between 2016-2019 were reviewed to create a descriptive dataset. Patients previously signed consent forms stating their preference for sperm transfer to their partner or disposal in the event of their subsequent death. Patients undergoing sperm cryopreservation for the purpose of ART were analyzed to assess associations between demographic characteristics and etiology of infertility and their choice to either transfer sperm to their partner or discard. RESULTS: A total of 84.9% (342/403) of patients included in final analyses elected to transfer their sperm to their partner in the event of their death. Factors associated with a significantly increased likelihood to transfer versus discard included a male-factor infertility diagnosis compared to female-factor infertility diagnosis (transfer rate 89.3% vs. 79.9%; p = .022) and commercial insurance coverage versus non-commercial/no insurance coverage (transfer rate 86.3% vs. 75.0%, p = .029). No significant differences relating to age, race/ethnicity, occupation classification, marital status or duration of marriage, or prior paternity were found. CONCLUSION: A majority of male patients seeking sperm cryopreservation for ART elected to transfer their sperm to their partner if future death should occur. There does not appear to be a clear factor that would impact this decision based on demographic characteristics.",0
Racial and ethnic disparities in end-of-life care for patients with oesophageal cancer: death trends over time.,"BACKGROUND: Given significant morbidity and mortality associated with oesophageal cancer, supportive, high-quality end-of-life care is critical. Most patients with advanced cancer prefer to die at home, but incongruence between preferred and actual place of death is common. Here, we examined trends and disparities in location of death among patients with oesophageal cancer. METHODS: Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Range Online Data for Epidemiologic Research database, we utilized multinomial logistic regression to assess associations between sociodemographic characteristics and location of death for patients with oesophageal cancer (n = 237,063). Additionally, we utilized linear regression models to evaluate the significance of changes in location of death trends over time and disparities in the relative change in location of death trends across sociodemographic groups. FINDINGS: From 2003 to 2019, there was a decrease of deaths in hospitals, nursing homes, and outpatient medical facilities/emergency departments and an increase of deaths at home and in hospice. Relative to White decedents, Black and Asian decedents were less likely to die at home (relative risk ratio (RRR): 0.58 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56-0.60], RRR: 0.57 [95% CI: 0.53-0.61]) and in hospice (RRR: 0.67 [95% CI: 0.64-0.71], RRR: 0.49 [95% CI: 0.43-0.55]) when compared to the hospital. Similar disparities were noted for American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) decedents. These disparities persisted even upon stratifying by the number of listed causes of death, a proxy for severity of illness. Time trend analysis indicated that increases in deaths in hospice over time occurred at a slower rate for AIAN and Asian decedents relative to White decedents. INTERPRETATION: 2 in 5 patients with oesophageal cancer die at home, with an increasing proportion dying at home and in hospice-in line with general patient preferences. However, location of death disparities have largely persisted over time among racial and ethnic minority groups. Our findings suggest the importance of improving access to advance care planning and delivering tailored, person-centred interventions. FUNDING: None.",0
Respiratory Management of Patients With Neuromuscular Weakness: An American College of Chest Physicians Clinical Practice Guideline and Expert Panel Report.,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory failure is a significant concern in neuromuscular diseases (NMDs). This CHEST guideline examines the literature on the respiratory management of patients with NMD to provide evidence-based recommendations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An expert panel conducted a systematic review addressing the respiratory management of NMD and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence and formulating and grading recommendations. A modified Delphi technique was used to reach a consensus on the recommendations. RESULTS: Based on 128 studies, the panel generated 15 graded recommendations, one good practice statement, and one consensus-based statement. INTERPRETATION: Evidence of best practices for respiratory management in NMD is limited and is based primarily on observational data in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The panel found that pulmonary function testing every 6 months may be beneficial and may be used to initiate noninvasive ventilation (NIV) when clinically indicated. An individualized approach to NIV settings may benefit patients with chronic respiratory failure and sleep-disordered breathing related to NMD. When resources allow, polysomnography or overnight oximetry can help to guide the initiation of NIV. The panel provided guidelines for mouthpiece ventilation, transition to home mechanical ventilation, salivary secretion management, and airway clearance therapies. The guideline panel emphasizes that NMD pathologic characteristics represent a diverse group of disorders with differing rates of decline in lung function. The clinician's role is to add evaluation at the bedside to shared decision-making with patients and families, including respect for patient preferences and treatment goals, considerations of quality of life, and appropriate use of available resources in decision-making.",0
"Dissemination and implementation of clinical practice guidelines: a longitudinal, mixed-methods evaluation of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care's knowledge translation efforts.","BACKGROUND: The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (task force) develops evidence-based preventive health care guidelines and knowledge translation (KT) tools to facilitate guideline dissemination and implementation. We aimed to determine practitioners' awareness of task force guidelines and KT tools and explore barriers and facilitators to their use. METHODS: The task force's KT team completed annual evaluations using surveys and interviews with primary care providers in Canada from 2014 to 2020, to assess practitioners' awareness and determinants of use of task force guidelines and tools. We transcribed interviews verbatim and double-coded them using a framework analysis approach. RESULTS: A total of 1284 primary care practitioners completed surveys and 183 participated in interviews. On average, 79.9% of participants were aware of the task force's 7 cancer screening guidelines, 36.2% were aware of the other 6 screening guidelines and 18.6% were aware of the 3 lifestyle or prevention guidelines. Participants identified 13 barriers and 7 facilitators to guideline and KT tool implementation; these were consistent over time. Participants identified strategies at the public and patient, provider and health systems levels to improve uptake of guidelines. INTERPRETATION: Canadian primary care practitioners were more aware of task force cancer screening guidelines than its other preventive health guidelines. Over the 6-year period, participants consistently reported barriers to guideline uptake, including misalignment with patient preferences and other provincial or specialty guideline organizations. Further evaluations will assess tailored strategies to address the barriers identified.",0
Patients' and informal caregivers' perspectives on self-management interventions for type 2 diabetes mellitus outcomes: a mixed-methods overview of 14 years of reviews.,"BACKGROUND: Self-management interventions (SMIs) are core components of high-quality care in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We aimed to identify and summarise the scientific evidence exploring the perspectives of patients with T2DM and their informal caregivers on outcomes of SMIs, and the key themes to enhance T2DM patient-centred care. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods overview of reviews. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO, up to June 2021 for systematic reviews (SRs) exploring the perspectives of adults with T2DM and their informal caregivers, regarding self-management. Two reviewers conducted independently study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. We estimated the degree of overlap across SRs. We performed a qualitative analysis using a thematic synthesis approach. RESULTS: We identified 54 SRs, corresponding to 939 studies, with a slight overlap. Most SRs (47/54, 87%) were considered high quality. We developed summaries for 22 outcomes and identified six overarching themes: (1) diabetic identity; (2) accessing healthcare; (3) experience of care; (4) engagement with self-management; (5) outcomes awareness; and (6) challenges adhering to self-management. We found important variability in how patients with T2DM and their informal caregivers value critical outcomes influenced by the disease progression and several contextual factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings represent what matters most to patients with T2DM and their informal caregivers regarding outcomes of SMIs. Our results can facilitate the development and evaluation of SMIs, and guide decision-making in diabetes care, including the formulation of decisions and recommendations.",0
Research recruitment and consent methods in a pandemic: a qualitative study of COVID-19 patients' perspectives.,"BACKGROUND: Virtual data collection methods and consent procedures adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic enabled continued research activities, but also introduced concerns about equity, inclusivity, representation, and privacy. Recent studies have explored these issues from institutional and researcher perspectives, but there is a need to explore patient perspectives and preferences. This study aims to explore COVID-19 patients' perspectives about research recruitment and consent for research studies about COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an exploratory qualitative focus group and interview study among British Columbian adults who self-identified as having had COVID-19. We recruited participants through personal contacts, social media, and REACH BC, an online platform that connects researchers and patients in British Columbia. We analyzed transcripts inductively and developed thematic summaries of each coding element. RESULTS: Of the 22 individuals recruited, 16 attended a focus group or interview. We found that autonomy and the feasibility of participation, attitudes toward research about COVID-19, and privacy concerns are key factors that influence participants' willingness to participate in research. We also found that participants preferred remote and virtual approaches for contact, consent, and delivery of research on COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who had COVID-19 are motivated to participate in research studies and value autonomy in their decision to participate, but researchers must be sensitive and considerate toward patient preferences and concerns, particularly as researchers adopt virtual recruitment and data collection methods. Such awareness may increase research participation and engagement.",0
Patient Preferences for Investigating Cancer-Related Symptoms in Australian General Practice: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Striking the right balance between early cancer diagnosis and the risk of excessive testing for low-risk symptoms is of paramount importance. Patient-centred care must also consider patient preferences for testing. AIM: To investigate diagnostic testing preferences of the Australian public for symptoms associated with oesophagogastric (OG), bowel, or lung cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: One of three discrete choice experiments (DCEs) related to either OG, bowel, or lung cancer were administered to a nationally representative sample of Australians aged 40 and above. METHODS: Each DCE comprised three scenarios with symptom positive predictive values (PPVs) for undiagnosed cancer ranging from 1% to 3%. The numerical risk was concealed from participants. DCE attributes encompassed the testing strategy, GP familiarity, test and result waiting times, travel duration, and test cost. Preferences were estimated using conditional and mixed logit models. RESULTS: A total of 3013 individuals participated in one of three DCEs: OG (n=1004), Bowel (n=1006), and Lung (n=1003). Preferences were chiefly driven by waiting time, test cost followed by the test type. There was preference for more invasive tests. When confronted with symptoms carrying an extremely low risk (symptom PPV of 1% or less), participants were more inclined to abstain from testing. CONCLUSIONS: Access-related factors, particularly waiting times and testing costs, emerged as the most pivotal elements influencing preferences, underscoring the substantial impact of these systemic factors on patient choices regarding investigations.",1
Preference for primary care in Chinese homebound patients.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the preference for primary healthcare (PHC) and investigate associated factors among homebound residents in both rural and urban areas of China. It provides valuable insights to facilitate the rational allocation of healthcare resources and promote the utilization of PHC. METHODS: In this nationally representative cross-sectional study, we utilized the most recent data (2020) from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). Participants were recruited from 25 provincial-level administrative regions in both rural and urban areas of China. Homebound patients were asked to provide details about their individual characteristics, variables related to family caregiving, and preferences for PHC. Multivariable logistic models were used to analyze potential factors associated with preference for PHC. Estimates of association were reported as odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The study found that 58.43% of rural patients reported a preference for PHC, while 42.78% of urban patients favored PHC. Compared to rural participants who did not received inpatient care in the past year, those who received inpatient care in the past year had 67% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR:0.33, 95% CI:0.19-0.59); Compared to rural participants who did not received family caregiving when ill, those who received family caregiving when ill had 59% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.41, 95% CI:0.21-0.77). Correspondingly, Compared to urban participants who did not received inpatient care in the past year, those who had received inpatient care in the past year had 75% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.10-0.56); Compared to urban participants who did not received family caregiving when ill, those who received family caregiving when ill had 73% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.11-0.63); Compared to urban participants who with agricultural Hukou, those with Non-agricultural Hukou had 61% lower odds of choosing PHC (OR: 0.39, 95% CI:0.18-0.83); Compared to urban participants living in the eastern part of mainland China, those living in the central part of China had 188% higher odds of choosing PHC (OR: 2.88, 95% CI: 1.14-7.29). CONCLUSION: Policymakers should focus on tailoring PHC to vulnerable populations and prioritizing family-based public health strategies for enhancing homebound patients' perceptions of PHC. Furthermore, further study is needed on whether the Hukou registration system affects the barriers that homebound patients experience in choosing healthcare providers.",0
Elevated end-of-life spending: A new measure of potentially wasteful health care spending at the end of life.,"OBJECTIVE: To construct a new measure of end-of-life (EoL) spending-the elevated EoL spending-and examine its associations with measures of quality of care and patient and physician preferences in comparison with the commonly used total Medicare EoL spending measures. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING: Medicare claims data for a 20% random sample of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients, from the health care quality data for 2015-2016, from the Hospital Compare and the Medicare Geographic Variation public use file, and survey data about patient and physician preferences. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed the elevated EoL spending measure as the differential monthly spending between decedents and survivors with the same one-year mortality risk, where the risk was predicted using machine learning models. We then examined the associations of the hospital referral region (HRR)-level elevated EoL spending with various health care quality measures and with the survey-elicited patient and provider preferences. We also examined analogous associations for monthly total EoL spending on decedents. DATA EXTRACTION METHODS: Medicare FFS patients who were continuously enrolled in Medicare Parts A & B in 2015 and were alive as of January 1, 2016. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found a large variation in the elevated EoL spending across HRRs in the United States. There was no evidence of an association between HRR-level elevated EoL spending and established health care quality measures, including those specific to EoL care, whereas total EoL spending was positively associated with certain quality of care measures. We also found no evidence that elevated EoL spending was associated with patient preferences for EoL care. However, elevated EoL spending was positively and significantly associated with physician preferences for treatment intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that elevated EoL spending captures different resource use from conventional measures of EoL spending and may be more valuable in identifying potentially wasteful spending.",0
"Association of Race, Ethnicity, Insurance, and Language and Rate of Breast-Conserving Therapy Among Women With Nonmetastatic Breast Cancer at an Urban, Safety-Net Hospital.","INTRODUCTION: Breast-conserving therapy (BCT), specifically breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and adjuvant radiation, provides an equivalent alternative to mastectomy for eligible patients. However, previous studies have shown that BCT is underused in the United States, particularly among marginalized demographic groups. In this study, we examine the association between race, ethnicity, insurance, and language and rate of BCS among patients treated at an academic, safety-net hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 520 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer diagnosed and treated at an academic, safety-net hospital (2009-2014). We assessed eligibility for BCT and then differences in the rate of BCT among eligible patients by race, ethnicity, insurance, and language. Reasons for not undergoing BCT were documented. RESULTS: Median age was 60 y; 55.9% were non-White, 31.9% were non-English-speaking, 15.6% were Hispanic, and 47.4% were Medicaid/uninsured. Three hundred seventy one (86.3%) underwent BCS; within this group, 324 (87.3%) completed adjuvant radiation. Among patients undergoing mastectomy, 30 patients (36.7%) were eligible for BCT; within this group, reasons for mastectomy included patient preference (n = 28) and to avoid possible re-excision or adjuvant radiation in patients with significant comorbidities (n = 2). Eligibility for BCT varied by ethnicity (Hispanic [100%], Non-Hispanic [92%], P = 0.02), but not race, language, or insurance. Among eligible patients, rate of BCS varied by age (<50 y [84.9%], ≥50 y [92.9%], P = 0.01) and ethnicity (Hispanic [98.5%], Non-Hispanic [91.3%], P = 0.04), but not race, language, or insurance. CONCLUSIONS: At our safety-net hospital, the rate of BCS among eligible patients did not vary by race, language, or insurance. Excluding two highly comorbid patients, all patients who underwent mastectomy despite being eligible for BCT were counseled regarding BCS and expressed a preference for mastectomy. Further research is needed to understand the value of BCT in the treatment of breast cancer, to ensure informed decision-making, address potential misconceptions regarding BCT, and advance equitable care for all patients.",0
Patient Perspectives on the Burden and Prevention of Diabetes-Related Foot Disease.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to understand patient perspectives about the impact and prevention of diabetes-related foot disease (DFD). METHODS: An online survey was distributed to patients with a history of DFD during 2020. The survey was designed alongside clinical specialists and DFD patients and utilized the health belief model. It asked about the impact of DFD on health, perceptions on preventive strategies, perceived need for additional support, and patient preferences for telehealth in DFD management. Quantitative data were summarized descriptively and compared between groups. Open-text responses were analyzed using conceptual content analysis. RESULTS: Of 80 participants with a history of DFD, foot ulcers were the complication most often experienced, with over two-thirds having been admitted to hospital for a DFD-related issue and over one-third having a DFD-related amputation. Participants had ranging perceptions on the effect of DFD on health, from minimal to crippling. Those with previous severe DFD complications leading to hospital admission found a lack of mobility and independence the consequences of most concern. Using offloading footwear was perceived as very important for preventing DFD complications, although the use of offloading footwear was low, with participants citing issues relating to cost, comfort, appearance, and access to footwear as barriers to better adherence. Perceptions on telehealth were mixed, with many participants not having access to or being comfortable with the use of digital technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DFD require additional supports for effective prevention, including offloading footwear.",0
Patient motivators to use opioids for acute pain after emergency care.,"INTRODUCTION: Patients are stakeholders in their own pain management. Factors motivating individuals to seek or use opioids therapeutically for treatment of acute pain are not well characterized but could be targeted to reduce incident iatrogenic opioid use disorder (OUD). Emergency departments (EDs) commonly encounter patients in acute pain for whom decisions regarding opioid therapy are required. Decision-making is necessarily challenged in episodic, unscheduled care settings given time pressure, limited information, and lack of pre-existing patient provider relationship. Patients may decline to take prescribed opioids or conversely seek opioids from other providers or non-medical sources. METHODS: Using a framework analysis approach, we qualitatively analyzed transcripts from 29 patients after discharge from an ED visit for acute pain at a large, urban, academic hospital in the midwestern United States to describe motivating factors influencing patient decisions regarding opioid use for acute pain. A semi-structured interview guide framed participant discussion in either a focus group or interview transcribed and analyzed with conventional content analysis. RESULTS: Four major themes emerged from our analysis including a) pain management literacy, b) control preferences, c) risk tolerance, and d) cues to action. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest targets for future intervention development and a framework to guide the engagement of patients as stakeholders in their own acute pain management.",0
miRNAs as cornerstones in chronic lymphocytic leukemia pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance- An emphasis on the interaction of signaling pathways.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) accounts for the vast majority of cases of leukemia. Patients of advanced age are more likely to develop the condition, which has a highly varied clinical course. Consideration of illness features and preceding treatment sequence, as well as patient preferences and comorbidities, is necessary for selecting the appropriate treatment for the appropriate patient. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity to detect CLL early, monitor CLL patients, select the treatment responders, and reduce ineffective treatment, unwanted side effects, and unnecessary expenses. In both homeostasis and illness, microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) play a vital role as master regulators of gene expression and, by extension, protein expression. MiRNAs typically reduce the stability of mRNAs, including those encoding genes involved in tumorigenesis processes as cell cycle regulation, inflammation, stress response, angiogenesis, differentiation, apoptosis, and invasion. Due to their unique properties, miRNAs are rapidly being exploited as accurate biomarkers for illness detection, and medicines based on miRNA targets are finding widespread application in clinical practice. Accordingly, the current review serves as a quick primer on CLL and the biogenesis of miRNAs. In addition to providing a brief overview of the miRNAs whose function in the progression of CLL has been established by recent in vitro or in vivo research through articulating the influence of these miRNAs on a wide variety of cellular functions, including increased proliferative potential; support for angiogenesis; cell cycle aberration; evasion of apoptosis; promotion of metastasis; and reduced sensitivity to specific treatments.",0
Barriers to Optimal Clinician Guideline Adherence in the Management of Markedly Elevated Blood Pressure: A Qualitative Content Analysis of Electronic Health Records.,"IMPORTANCE: Hypertension poses a significant public health challenge. Despite clinical practice guidelines for hypertension management, clinician adherence to these guidelines remains suboptimal. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a taxonomy of suboptimal adherence scenarios for severe hypertension and identify barriers to guideline adherence. DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative content analysis using electronic health records (EHRs) of Yale New Haven Health System who had at least two consecutive visits between January 1, 2013, and October 31, 2018. SETTING: This was a thematic analysis of EHR data to generate a real-world taxonomy of scenarios of suboptimal clinician guideline adherence in the management of severe hypertension. PARTICIPANTS: We identified patients with markedly elevated blood pressure ([BP]; defined as at least 2 consecutive readings of BP ≥160/100 mmHg) and no prescription for antihypertensive medication within a 90-day of the 2(nd) BP elevation (n=4,828). We randomly selected 100 records from the group of all eligible patients for qualitative analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The scenarios and influencing factors contributing to clinician non-adherence to the guidelines for hypertension management. RESULTS: Thematic saturation was reached after analyzing 100 patient records. Three content domains emerged: clinician-related scenarios (neglect and diffusion of responsibility), patient-related scenarios (patient non-adherence and patient preference), and clinical complexity-related scenarios (diagnostic uncertainty, maintenance of current intervention and competing medical priorities). Through a metareview of literature, we identified several plausible influencing factors, including a lack of protocols and processes that clearly define the roles within the institution to implement guidelines, infrastructure limitations, and clinicians' lack of autonomy and authority, excessive workload, time constraints, clinician belief that intervention was not part of their role, or perception that guidelines restrict clinical judgment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study illuminates reasons for suboptimal adherence to guidelines for managing markedly elevated BP. The taxonomy of suboptimal adherence scenarios, derived from real-world EHR data, is pragmatic and provides a basis for developing targeted interventions to improve clinician guideline adherence and patient outcomes.",0

The Relative Importance of Factors That Applicants Weigh When Ranking Adult Reconstruction Fellowships as Well as Their Perspectives on Robotic-Assisted Arthroplasty.,"BACKGROUND: Orthopedic Surgery Fellowship programs offer highly specialized training that varies based on the training environment and surgical experience. Additionally, for Adult Reconstruction programs, robotic-assisted surgery exposure has been a widely discussed topic. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative value of various factors to Adult Hip and Knee Fellowship applicants, and their perceptions of robotic-assisted arthroplasty. METHODS: We surveyed 780 applicants who applied to our fellowship to matriculate in 2020 to 2024. We received 158 responses (20.3% response rate). We assessed factors concerning people and perceptions, logistics, salary and benefits, program reputation and curriculum, and surgical experience. Additionally, we surveyed fellows' attitudes toward using robotic surgery and its impact on patient outcomes. RESULTS: The highest-rated factors were Level of Hands-On Operative Experience (4.83), Revision Hip Volume (4.72), Revision Knee Volume (4.71), Multiple Surgical Exposures to the Hip (4.59), and Clinical Case Variety (4.59). Respondents who were postfellowship matriculation placed significantly more value on Exposure to Multiple Attendings with Surgical Diversity (P = .01), and Anterior Hip Volume (P = .04), and less value on Geographic Location (P = .04) and Patient-Specific Instrumentation (P = .02) than prematriculates. Overall, 65% of applicants plan to or currently use robotics, 7.6% do not, and 27.2% said ""Maybe"". Those who plan to or currently use robotics most cited procedure fidelity, patient-preference, and marketability as reasons to use robotics. CONCLUSIONS: Hands-on surgical experience and revision volume were the most important factors for fellowship applicants. Applicants placed lower importance on robotics exposure and their perspectives on robotics in their future practice were highly variable. Our results will inform fellowship programs and future applicants what previous applicants have valued in their training to help guide fellowship program structure, resource management, as well as recruitment.",0
"Getting to know our patients and what matters: exploring the elicitation of patient values, preferences, and circumstances in neurological rehabilitation.","PURPOSE: Patient values, preferences, and circumstances are critical to decision-making in both patient-centred and evidence-based practice models of healthcare. Despite the established importance of integrating these patient attributes, the ways they are elicited in rehabilitation remain unclear. This study aimed to explore how health professionals elicit and share patients' 'values', 'preferences', and 'circumstances', and what they understand by the terms. METHODS: This exploratory qualitative descriptive study used interviews with 13 clinicians from interprofessional teams in inpatient neurological rehabilitation. Data were analysed using a general inductive approach. RESULTS: Participants understood 'values' to mean what is important and meaningful; 'preferences' as likes/dislikes and choices; and 'circumstances' as the social, physical, and environmental context surrounding the person. Formal and informal strategies were used to gather information directly from patients or indirectly from other sources. The processes of eliciting and communicating this information were influenced by relationships and relied on contributions from many people. Elicitation involved a flexible approach tailored to the individual and considering each unique context. CONCLUSION: The strategies used and the approach used to implement these strategies were both essential to eliciting patient values, preferences, and circumstances in neurological rehabilitation. These findings offer insights into the practices of interprofessional rehabilitation clinicians. Implications for rehabilitationEliciting patient values, preferences, and circumstances involves a combination of strategies and approaches that are applied gradually throughout the continuum of rehabilitation.These processes are flexible, and strategies should be tailored to individual patients/families and phases of rehabilitation.Clinicians should be attentive to informal opportunities to gather valuable information throughout rehabilitation.Establishing positive relationships and using effective communication is foundational to these processes.",0
Preference of young adults for COVID-19 vaccination in the United Kingdom: a discrete choice experiment.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine preferences for COVID-19 vaccinations in the young adult population in the United Kingdom (UK). METHOD: A discrete choice experiment survey was conducted in UK young adults. Participants were asked to choose between two hypothetical vaccines the one they preferred the most. Vaccines were defined by five attributes (effectiveness, risk of side effects, duration of protection, number of doses, confidence in available evidence), identified following a systematic literature review and qualitative interviews with 13 young adults. A random parameters logit model, a latent class model, and subgroup analyses were used to identify preferences. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-nine respondents were included (70% women, mean age 23 years). All five attributes significantly influenced respondents' vaccination decisions. Respondents valued higher effectiveness, lower risk of side effects, longer protection duration, and a smaller number of doses. Based on the range of levels of each attribute, vaccine effectiveness was the most important attribute (relative importance 34%), followed by risk of side effects (32%), and duration of vaccine protection (22%). CONCLUSIONS: The five investigated vaccine attributes appear to play an important role in young adults' decision-making process. Results of this study may help health authorities designing appropriate strategies in future vaccines campaigns in the younger UK population.",1
Acne characteristics in Latin American patients and the potential role of trifarotene.,"BACKGROUND: Individualization of treatment based on acne type and severity, location, disease burden, and patient preference is required to maximize efficacy, safety, and adherence to therapy. Latin American populations have unique attributes that must be considered as part of this process to improve clinical success and achieve patient goals. Acne is more common among patients with darker skin phototypes, in whom it is often associated with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring-the most important acne sequelae-potentially due to more frequent and more severe underlying inflammatory processes in this population. DISCUSSION: These data argue for an early and proactive approach to managing acne in these patients with agents that target the inflammatory processes that underlie acne and its sequelae. As a class, retinoids offer a spectrum of activity that may be useful in addressing the unique needs of Latin American populations. CONCLUSION: Trifarotene, a novel, selective retinoid, has been evaluated in relevant patient populations.",0
Patient and Public Acceptance of Digital Technologies in Health Care: Protocol for a Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Strokes pose a particular challenge to the health care system. Although stroke-related mortality has declined in recent decades, the absolute number of new strokes (incidence), stroke deaths, and survivors of stroke has increased. With the increasing need of neurorehabilitation and the decreasing number of professionals, innovations are needed to ensure adequate care. Digital technologies are increasingly used to meet patients' unfilled needs during their patient journey. Patients must adhere to unfamiliar digital technologies to engage in health interventions. Therefore, the acceptance of the benefits and burdens of digital technologies in health interventions is a key factor in implementing these innovations. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the development of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to weigh criteria that impact patient and public acceptance. Secondary study objectives are a benefit-burden assessment (estimation of the maximum acceptable burden of technical features and therapy-related characteristics for the patient or individual, eg, no human contact), overall comparison (assessment of the relative importance of attributes for comparing digital technologies), and adherence (identification of key attributes that influence patient adherence). The exploratory objectives include heterogeneity assessment and subgroup analysis. The methodological aims are to investigate the use of DCE. METHODS: To obtain information on the criteria impacting acceptance, a DCE will be conducted including 7 attributes based on formative qualitative research. Patients with stroke (experimental group) and the general population (control group) are surveyed. The final instrument includes 6 best-best choice tasks in partial design. The experimental design is a fractional-factorial efficient Bayesian design (D-error). A conditional logit regression model and mixed logistic regression models will be used for analysis. To consider the heterogeneity of subgroups, a latent class analysis and an analysis of heteroscedasticity will be performed. RESULTS: The literature review, qualitative preliminary study, survey development, and pretesting were completed. Data collection and analysis will be completed in the last quarter of 2023. CONCLUSIONS: Our results will inform decision makers about patients' and publics' acceptance of digital technologies used in innovative interventions. The patient preference information will improve decisions regarding the development, adoption, and pricing of innovative interventions. The behavioral changes in the choice of digital intervention alternatives are observable and can therefore be statistically analyzed. They can be translated into preferences, which define the value. This study will investigate the influences on the acceptance of digital interventions and thus support decisions and future research.

Co-creation of the Global Patient Experience Data Navigator: a multi-stakeholder initiative to ensure the patient voice is represented in health decision-making.,"BACKGROUND: Putting patients' needs and priorities at the forefront of healthcare initiatives and medical product development is critical to achieve outcomes that matter most to patients. This relies on the integration of early, meaningful patient engagement (PE) to learn what is important to patients, and collection of representative patient experience data (PXD). The increased number of PE/PXD efforts across global regulatory, health technology assessment, and healthcare systems is an important step forward to deliver improved health outcomes for patients. However, these initiatives are fragmented and lack integration, which is necessary to maximize efforts and reduce burden on patients. To overcome these challenges, the Global Patient Experience Data Navigator has been co-created by Patient Focused Medicines Development to provide practical resources that can facilitate and optimize PXD generation, collection, analysis, and dissemination for patient benefit and aims to be applicable across all therapeutic areas for all stakeholders. METHODS: Co-creation of the Navigator took place through an iterative process of validation and formalization driven by a diverse, multi-stakeholder working group with individuals who have varying knowledge/experience in PE/PXD. RESULTS: A series of workshops took place to conduct a gap analysis, develop a taxonomy model, and integrate existing frameworks. The collective insights led to the development of the Navigator consisting of four specific tools in the form of downloadable templates, which can be used to: (1) prioritize outcomes that matter most to patients and their caregivers; (2) select appropriate measurement methods for these outcomes; (3) identify when and why PXD is used throughout the product development cycle for each stakeholder; (4) identify when and why PXD is used throughout the healthcare process for each stakeholder. A public consultation was carried out to collect user feedback before the Navigator was made publicly available in December 2022. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, the Global Patient Experience Data Navigator is the only publicly available toolkit developed with a multi-stakeholder and disease-agnostic approach providing taxonomically grouped resources to optimize the collection and collation of PXD for patient benefit. Future work will aim to further engage patients by adding a PE dimension to the Navigator.",0
Advance care planning-family carer psychological distress and involvement in decision making: the ACTION trial.,"OBJECTIVES: Facilitated advance care planning (ACP) helps family carers' to be aware of patient preferences. It can improve family carers' involvement in decision making and their overall experiences at the end of life, as well as, reduce psychological stress. We investigated the effects of the ACTION Respecting Choices (RC) ACP intervention on the family carers' involvement in decision making in the last 3 months of the patients' life and on the family carers' psychological distress after 3 months of bereavement. METHODS: Over six European countries, a sample of 162 bereaved family carers returned a bereavement questionnaire. Involvement in decision making was measured with a single item of the Views of Informal Carers-Evaluation of Services Short Form questionnaire. Psychological distress was measured with the Impact of Event Scale (IES). RESULTS: No significant effect was found on family carers involvement in decision making in the last 3 months of the patients' life (95% CI 0.449 to 4.097). However, the probability of involvement in decision making was slightly higher in the intervention arm of the study (89.6% vs 86.7%; OR=1.357). Overall, no statistical difference was found between intervention and control group regarding the IES (M=34.1 (1.7) vs 31.8 (1.5); (95% CI -2.2 to 6.8)). CONCLUSION: The ACTION RC ACP intervention showed no significant effect on family carers' involvement in decision making or on subsequent psychological distress. More research is needed about (1) how family carers can be actively involved in ACP-conversations and (2) how to prepare family carers on their role in decision making.

Meeting the Needs of Patient Preferences in Imaging.,"Healthcare continues to transition toward a patient-centered paradigm, where patients are active in medical decisions. Fully embracing this new paradigm means updating how clinical guidelines are formulated, accounting for patient preferences for medical care. Recently, several societies have incorporated patient preference evidence in their updated clinical practice guidelines, and patients in their expert panels. To fully transition to a patient-centered-paradigm, imaging organizations should rethink the formulation of clinical guidelines, accounting for patient preference evidence.",0
Should Antihypertensive Medications Be Routinely Administered in the Nighttime Instead of Daytime?,"The optimal timing for administering antihypertensive medications remains a topic of debate. This review examines the effectiveness of nighttime vs daytime administration of antihypertensive medications in controlling blood pressure (BP). The MAPEC and Hygia trials suggest that nighttime dosing achieves better BP control and significantly lowers cardiovascular events. However, concerns about methodology and generalizability have been raised. In contrast, the HARMONY and TIME trials found no significant difference in BP control nor cardiovascular outcomes between daytime and nighttime dosing. Current research suggests that the timing of antihypertensive medication administration may not be a crucial factor. Therefore, the decision about the timing of antihypertensive medications administration should be individualized, taking into account patient preference and clinical context, in order to promote consistent compliance.",0
Contemporary surgical and procedural management of benign prostatic hyperplasia.,"Interventions for benign prostatic hyperplasia have evolved from transurethral resection of the prostate and simple prostatectomy to a myriad of office-based and operating-room procedures.

This review details currently available and guideline-backed surgical and procedural treatments.",0
The Impact of Substantial Improvements in HbA1c and Weight Loss on the Medication Preferences of People with Type 2 Diabetes.,"PURPOSE: To quantify the preferences of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) for treatment attributes of a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA) versus an injectable GLP-1 RA medication profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Injection-naive people taking oral medications for T2D in the US and UK completed a web survey including a discrete choice experiment to quantify patients' preferences for five treatment attributes: delivery system, frequency of nausea, frequency of hypoglycemia, HbA1c reduction, and weight reduction. Attributes and levels were based on head-to-head clinical trial data of tirzepatide 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg versus semaglutide 1mg. Preference data were analyzed separately by country using multinomial mixed logit (MXL) models. MXL parameters were used to estimate the predicted preference for each tirzepatide dose versus semaglutide 1mg. Direct preferences for each dose of tirzepatide versus semaglutide 1mg were elicited. RESULTS: Participants (N=620) in the US (N=301) and UK (N=319) were 50.8% and 50.5% female with mean ages of 60.7 years and 58.9 years, respectively. The order and magnitude of relative attribute importance (RAI) scores differed between countries. HbA1c reduction (26.3%) had the greatest impact on US participants' preferences, and hypoglycemia (32.8%) did among UK participants. Attribute-level marginal utility results indicated preferences for greater HbA1c improvements, the single-use pre-filled pen, lower hypoglycemia, greater weight reductions, and lower frequency of nausea. Assuming the availability of only tirzepatide or semaglutide 1mg, the predicted preference for tirzepatide (5, 10, and 15mg) in the US is 95.6% (vs 4.4% for semaglutide 1mg) and in the UK was 86.3% (vs 13.7% for semaglutide 1mg). CONCLUSION: HbA1c reduction, frequency of hypoglycemia, and weight reduction are key drivers of preferences among people with T2D when considering medication options. Overall, people with T2D are likely to prefer the tirzepatide over the semaglutide 1mg medication profiles.",1
Immunotherapy in oncology and the kidneys: a clinical review of the evaluation and management of kidney immune-related adverse events.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are now widely used in the treatment of many cancers, and currently represent the standard of care for multiple malignancies. These agents enhance the T cell immune response to target cancer tissues, and have demonstrated considerable benefits for cancer outcomes. However, despite these improved outcomes, there are important kidney immune-related adverse events (iRAEs) associated with ICI. Acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis remains the most frequent kidney iRAE, however glomerular lesions and electrolytes disturbances are increasingly being recognized and reported. In this review, we summarize clinical features and identify risk factors for kidney iRAEs, and discuss the current understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms. We highlight the evidence basis for guideline-recommended management of ICI-related kidney injury as well as gaps in current knowledge. We advocate for judicious use of kidney biopsy to identify ICI-associated kidney injury, and early use of corticosteroid treatment where appropriate. Selected patients may also be candidates for re-challenge with ICI therapy after a kidney iRAE, in view of current data on recurrent rates of kidney injury. Risk of benefits of re-challenge must be considered on an individual considering patient preferences and prognosis. Lastly, we review current knowledge of ICI use in the setting of patients with end-stage kidney disease, including kidney transplant recipients and those receiving dialysis, which suggest that these patients should not be summarily excluded from the potential benefits of these cancer therapies.",0
"Understanding rural-urban differences in veterans' internet access, use and patient preferences for telemedicine.","BACKGROUND: The expansion of telemedicine (e.g., telephone or video) in the Veterans Health Administration (VA) raises concerns for health care disparities between rural and urban veterans. Factors impeding telemedicine use (e.g., broadband, digital literacy, age) disproportionally affect rural veterans. PURPOSE: To examine veteran-reported broadband access, internet use, familiarity with, and preferences for telemedicine stratified by residential rurality. METHODS: Three hundred fifty veterans with a VA primary care visit in March 2022 completed a 30-min computer-assisted telephone interview. The sampling design stratified veterans by residential rurality (i.e., rural or urban) and how primary care was delivered (i.e., in-person or by video). Counts and weighted percentages are reported. FINDINGS: After accounting for survey weights, 96.2% of respondents had in-home internet access and 89.5% reported functional connection speeds. However, rural- compared to urban-residing veterans were less likely to experience a telemedicine visit in the past year (74.1% vs. 85.2%; p = 0.02). When comparing telemedicine to in-person visits, rural versus urban-residing veterans rated them not as good (45.3% vs. 36.8%), just as good (51.1% vs. 53.1%), or better (3.5% vs. 10.0%) (p = 0.05). To make telemedicine visits easier, veterans, regardless of where they lived, recommended technology training (46.4%), help accessing the internet (26.1%), or provision of an internet-enabled device (25.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Though rural-residing veterans were less likely to experience a telemedicine visit, the same actionable facilitators to improve telemedicine access were reported regardless of residential rurality. Importantly, technology training was most often recommended. Policy makers, patient advocates, and other stakeholders should consider novel initiatives to provide training resources.",0
How do patients value features of biological medicine in rheumatoid arthritis? A discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to quantify the preference of the patients regarding biological DMARDs. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients' preferences were assessed using a discrete choice experiment. Eighteen different surveys describing eight attributes were designed using experimental design methods. Each survey presented eight choice tasks with two options for patients to choose one. A conditional logit model was used to calculate relative importance and willingness to pay. Subgroup analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of the patients' characteristic on their preferences. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included in the study. All attributes had significant effects on the patients' choices. The most important feature was the ability to preserve physical function. The least important feature was the route of administration. Surprisingly, the out-of-pocket cost was one of the last priorities for respondents. According to the relative importance calculations, 80% of the patients' preferences can be obtained by clinical attributes. Based on subgroup analysis, the most important patient characteristic that affected their choices was the monthly out-of-pocket history. CONCLUSIONS: Different features of treatment had different effects on the patients' preferences. Quantification of the impact of each attribute not only revealed their relative importance but also determined the trade-off rate among them.",1
Mailing abortion pills does not delay care: A cohort study comparing mailed to in-person dispensing of abortion medications in the United States.,"OBJECTIVE: Given the substantial barriers to abortion access in the United States, many clinics now mail patients abortion medications. We examined whether dispensing the medications by mail prolonged time to medication use. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed data from no-test medication abortions with medication provided either by mail or in a clinic from 11 United States clinics from February 2020 to January 2021. We examined mean number of days from patients' first contact with the clinic to mifepristone ingestion, its two-component intervals (first contact to medication dispensing and dispensing to mifepristone ingestion), and pregnancy duration at mifepristone ingestion. We used Poisson regression to compare mean outcomes across three dispensing methods: in-person, mailed from the clinic, and mailed from a mail-order pharmacy. RESULTS: Among the 2600 records, patients took mifepristone on average at 49 days of gestation (95% CI, 47-51) and 7 days (95% CI, 4-10) after first contact. Mean time from first contact to mifepristone ingestion was 6 days when medications were dispensed in-person and 9 days when mailed (p = 0.38). While time from first contact to dispensing was similar across methods (6 days in-person, 5 days mailed, p = 0.77), more time elapsed from dispensing to mifepristone ingestion when medications were mailed (4 days from clinic, 5 days from mail-order pharmacy) versus dispensed in-person (0.3 days, p < 0.001). Time to mifepristone ingestion was shorter with higher pregnancy duration. Pregnancy duration at ingestion was similar across methods (48 days in-person, 50 days mailed). CONCLUSIONS: Mailing medications did not significantly prolong time from patients' first contact with the clinic to mifepristone ingestion or increase pregnancy duration at mifepristone ingestion. IMPLICATIONS: Abortion providers should offer a range of medication abortion dispensing options, prioritizing patient preference.",0
Study protocol for a cross-sectional online survey investigating patient preferences and experiences of waiting for elective cardiac surgery.,"INTRODUCTION: Being on a waiting list for elective (planned) cardiac surgery can be physically and psychologically challenging for patients. Research suggests that stress associated with waiting for surgery is dependent on different individual and contextual factors. However, most data on patients' experiences of waiting for surgery and preferences for waiting list management derives from non-cardiac clinical populations. The aim of the current study is to explore patients' experiences of being on a waiting list for elective cardiac surgery, and their views on how the waiting experience could be improved in the future. This work will inform the patient management strategy during the waiting period for surgery across the four major hospitals in London directly involved in this study, and potentially beyond by transferring learning to other services. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a mixed-methods study that will collect quantitative and qualitative data using a cross-sectional online survey. Patients who are on waiting lists for elective surgery across four major cardiac surgery departments in London hospitals, and are at least 18 years old, will be invited by their healthcare team via text message or letter to complete the survey. The target sample size of non-randomly selected participants will be 268. Bivariable and multivariable regression models will be used to assess associations between survey items measuring the impact of the cardiac condition on specific life domains (eg, daily activities, social and family relationships, hobbies, sexual life), anxiety and depression symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 and survey items evaluating experiences of health services. Data on experience and preferences for improvements to the waiting experience will be analysed with qualitative content analysis using an inductive approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was reviewed and granted ethical approval by the East of England-East Cambridge Research Ethics Committee. Findings from this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, a research website and social media and with an online event engaging patients, members of the public, healthcare professionals and other relevant stakeholders. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMB: NCT05996640.",0
When should electronic medical records reminders for cancer screening stop?-Results from a national physician survey.,"BACKGROUND: Many older adults are screened for breast and colorectal cancers beyond guideline recommended thresholds. Electronic medical record (EMR) reminders are commonly used to prompt cancer screening. Behavioral economics theory suggests that changing the default settings for these reminders can be effective to reduce over-screening. We examined physician perspectives about acceptable thresholds for stopping EMR cancer screening reminders. METHODS: In a national survey of 1200 primary care physicians (PCP) and 600 gynecologists randomly selected from the AMA Masterfile, we asked physicians to choose whether EMR reminders for cancer screening should stop based on a list of criteria that included age, life expectancy, specific serious illnesses, and functional limitations. Physicians could choose multiple responses. PCPs were randomized to questions about breast or colorectal cancer screening. RESULTS: A total of 592 physicians participated (adjusted response rate 54.1%). 54.6% chose age and 71.8% chose life expectancy as criteria for stopping EMR reminders; only 30.6% chose functional limitations. Regarding age thresholds, 52.4% chose ages ≤75, 42.0% chose a threshold between 75 and 85, 5.6% would not stop reminders even at age 85. Regarding life expectancy thresholds, 32.0% chose ≥10 years, 53.1% chose a threshold between 5 and 9 years, 14.9% would not stop reminders even when life expectancy is <5 years. CONCLUSIONS: We found that many physicians would continue EMR reminders for cancer screening even in light of older age, limited life expectancy, and functional limitations. This may reflect reluctance to stop cancer screening and/or reluctance to stop EMR reminders so that physicians can retain control to decide for individual patients, for example, to assess patient preference and ability to tolerate treatment. There was consensus for stopping EMR reminders at ages 85+ and <5-year life expectancy. Interventions that seek to reduce over-screening by suppressing EMR reminders may be important for these groups but may have limited physician buy-in outside these thresholds.",0
Barriers and enablers to deprescribing of older adults and their caregivers: a systematic review and meta-synthesis.,"PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to identify the barriers and enablers to deprescribing from the viewpoint of community-dwelling older adults and their caregivers. METHODS: This meta-synthesis included a systematic review of the literature and an inductive thematic synthesis. Medline and EMBASE were searched for studies that qualitatively explored the perspectives of older adults or their caregivers on deprescribing. Studies had to use qualitative methodologies and include community-dwelling adults (or their caregivers) aged 60 years or older who were taking one or more chronic medications. The quality of studies was assessed using the CASP tool. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in the meta-synthesis. All studies included older adults, and 3 included caregivers or companions. Four barriers were identified: favorable perceptions of medications, fear of medication discontinuation, the complexity of the healthcare system and discouragement from healthcare professionals; and seven enablers were identified: medication safety concerns, patient autonomy and confidence, education, follow-up, deprescribing strategies, relationships with physicians, and patient-perceived benefits of deprescribing. CONCLUSION: Multiple barriers and enablers to deprescribing exist within the older adult population. Health system complexity and direct discouragement from healthcare providers were barriers uniquely identified in the older adult population. This population would benefit from interventions to increase their medication literacy, confidence, and autonomy in the deprescribing journey.",0
Visual performance and patient preference with bilateral implantation of an extended depth of focus or combined implantation of an extended depth of focus/trifocal intraocular lens.,"PURPOSE: Evaluate postoperative visual performance in patients with bilaterally implanted AT LARA or AT LARA/AT LISA tri (Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany) intraocular lenses. METHODS: Multicentered, comparative, open-label, retrospective/prospective study. Post-IOL implantation, patients were prospectively enrolled into this study; preoperative patient data were collected retrospectively. Follow-up was at 2-4 and 5-8 months post-surgery. The primary endpoint was binocular best corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA). The study was retrospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT05462067). RESULTS: Seventy-one patients (142 eyes) were enrolled; 67 patients (134 eyes) have 5-8 months data. The mean binocular CDVA at 2-4 months was -0.10 ± 0.06 logMAR in the bilateral AT LARA group (""bilateral"") and -0.11 ± 0.09 logMAR in the combined implantation AT LARA/ AT LISA tri group (""combined implantation""); (P = 0.4856). At 5-8 months, mean binocular CDVA was -0.13 ± 0.06 logMAR in the bilateral group and -0.11 ± 0.09 in the combined implantation group (P = 0.4003). At 5-8 months, more eyes in the bilateral group attained 0.2 logMAR or better binocular uncorrected intermediate VA (UIVA; 67 cm) than those in the combined implantation group (100% vs. 94%, respectively). The bilateral group achieved a mean of 0.24 ± 0.11 logMAR in uncorrected near VA (UCNVA), compared to a mean of 0.16 ± 0.12 logMAR in the combined implantation group at 5-8 months (P = 0.0041). CONCLUSIONS: A combined implantation approach (AT LARA in the distance dominant eye/AT LISA tri in the non-dominant eye) produced similar CDVA outcomes but better UCNVA as bilateral implantation with the AT LARA. UIVA was comparable between groups. No new safety concerns were reported.",0
Co-Design of an Evidence-Based Practice Continuing Education Course for Canadian Naturopathic Doctors.,"Objectives: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is a clinical decision-making process combining the best available scientific evidence with clinician expertise and patient preference. While EBP has been associated with a range of benefits, it is recognized that EBP is used suboptimally by a range of health professionals, including naturopathic doctors (NDs). Canadian NDs have expressed a high level of interest in opportunities to improve their EBP skills; however, barriers exist, including those that apply broadly to health professionals, and those that are unique to the naturopathic profession. The objective of the present project was to co-design an EBP continuing education (CE) course tailored to the needs and preferences of Canadian NDs. Design: These needs were solicited through the use of focus groups. Groups were stratified based on participants' use of evidence at baseline. The focus groups asked NDs about their definition of EBP, and their interest in an EBP course, including preferred content, and method of delivery. The focus group discussions were transcribed, and thematic analysis was completed. Subjects: Twenty-two Canadian NDs participated. Results: Participants reported a high level of understanding of EBP, a high level of interest in participating in an EBP course and provided actionable recommendations about course content and delivery. Some of the themes that emerged were consistent across the groups while others differed by stratification. Conclusions: The findings of this project will inform the development and evaluation of a future CE course.",0
Patient Preferences for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treatments: A Discrete-Choice Experiment.,"Treatments for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have varying benefit-risk profiles. We elicited 200 US patients' preferences for attributes associated with various first-line systemic treatments for unresectable HCC in a discrete-choice experiment (DCE) survey. Respondents answered nine DCE questions, each offering a choice between two hypothetical treatment profiles defined by six attributes with varying levels: overall survival (OS), months of maintained daily function, severity of palmar-plantar syndrome, severity of hypertension, risk of digestive-tract bleeding, and mode and frequency of administration. A random-parameters logit model was used to analyze the preference data. Patients regarded an additional 10 months of maintaining daily function without decline to be as important or more important than 10 additional months of OS, on average. Respondents valued avoiding moderate-to-severe palmar-plantar syndrome and hypertension more than extended OS. A respondent would require >10 additional months of OS (the greatest increase presented in the study) on average to offset the increased burden of adverse events. Patients with unresectable HCC prioritize avoiding adverse events that would severely impact their quality of life over mode and frequency of administration or digestive-tract bleeding risk. For some patients with unresectable HCC, maintaining daily functioning is as important or more important than the survival benefit of a treatment.",1
Telehealth Complementary and Integrative Health Therapies During COVID-19 at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.,"Background: Complementary and integrative health (CIH) therapies, such as in-person acupuncture, chiropractic care, and meditation, are evidence-based nonpharmaceutical treatment options for pain. During COVID-19, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) delivered several CIH therapies virtually. This study explores veterans' utilization, advantages/disadvantages, and delivery issues of yoga, Tai Chi, meditation/mindfulness (self-care), and massage, chiropractic, and acupuncture (practitioner-delivered care), using telephone/video at 18 VA sites during COVID-19. Methods: Use of virtual care was examined quantitatively with VA administrative data for six CIH therapies before and after COVID-19 onset (2019-2021). Advantages/disadvantages and health care delivery issues of these CIH therapies through virtual care were examined qualitatively using interview data (2020-2021). Results: Overall, televisits represented a substantial portion of all CIH self-care therapies delivered by VA in 2020 (53.7%) and 2021 (82.1%), as sites developed virtual group classes using VA secure online video platforms in response to COVID-19. In contrast, a small proportion of all encounters with acupuncturists, chiropractors, and massage therapists was telephone/video encounters in 2020 (17.3%) and in 2021 (5.4%). These were predominantly one-on-one care in the form of education, follow-ups, home exercises, assessments/evaluations, or acupressure. Delivery issues included technical difficulties, lack of access to needed technology, difficulty tracking virtual visits, and capacity restrictions. Advantages included increased access to self-care, increased patient receptivity to engaging in self-care, and flexibility in staffing online group classes. Disadvantages included patient preference, patient safety, and strain on staffing. Conclusion: Despite delivery issues or disadvantages of tele-CIH self-care, veterans' use of teleself-care CIH therapies grew substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
Treatment of Granulomatous Inflammation in Pulmonary Sarcoidosis.,"The management of pulmonary sarcoidosis is a complex interplay of disease characteristics, the impact of medications, and patient preferences. Foremost, it is important to weigh the risk of anti-granulomatous treatment with the benefits of lung preservation and improvement in quality of life. Because of its high spontaneous resolution rate, pulmonary sarcoidosis should only be treated in cases of significant symptoms due to granulomatous inflammation, lung function decline, or substantial inflammation on imaging that can lead to irreversible fibrosis. The longstanding basis of treatment has historically been corticosteroid therapy for the control of granulomatous inflammation. However, several corticosteroid-sparing options have increasing evidence for use in refractory disease, inability to taper steroids to an acceptable dose, or in those with toxicity to corticosteroids. Treatment of sarcoidosis should be individualized for each patient due to the heterogeneity of the clinical course, comorbid conditions, response to therapy, and tolerance of medication side effects.",0

"Discrepancy in responses to the surprise question between hemodialysis nurses and physicians, with focus on patient clinical characteristics: A comparative study.","INTRODUCTION: The surprise question (SQ) ""Would I be surprised if this patient died within the next xx months"" can be used by different professions to foresee the need of serious illness conversations in patients approaching end of life. However, little is known about the different perspectives of nurses and physicians in responses to the SQ and factors influencing their appraisals. The aim was to explore nurses' and physicians' responses to the SQ regarding patients on hemodialysis, and to investigate how these answers were associated with patient clinical characteristics. METHODS: This comparative cross-sectional study included 361 patients for whom 112 nurses and 15 physicians responded to the SQ regarding 6 and 12 months. Patient characteristics, performance status, and comorbidities were obtained. Cohen's kappa was used to analyze the interrater agreement between nurses and physicians in their responses to the SQ and multivariable logistic regression was applied to reveal the independent association to patient clinical characteristics. FINDINGS: Proportions of nurses and physicians responding to the SQ with ""no, not surprised"" was similar regarding 6 and 12 months. However, there was a substantial difference concerning which specific patient the nurses and physicians responded ""no, not surprised"", within 6 (κ = 0.366, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.288-0.474) and 12 months (κ = 0.379, p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.281-0.477). There were also differences in the patient clinical characteristics associated with nurses' and physicians' responses to the SQ. DISCUSSION: Nurses and physicians have different perspectives in their appraisal when responding to the SQ for patients on hemodialysis. This may reinforce the need for communication and discussion between nurses and physicians to identify the need of serious illness conversations in patients approaching the end of life, in order to adapt hemodialysis care to patient preferences and needs.",0
The Impact of Video-Based Educational Materials with Voiceovers on Preferences for Glucose Monitoring Technology in Patients with Diabetes: A Randomised Study.,"INTRODUCTION: Ensuring patients have enough information about healthcare choices prior to completing a preference study is necessary to support the validity of the findings. Patients are commonly informed using text-based information with supporting graphics. Video-based information may be more engaging for the general patient population. This study aimed to assess (1) the impact that educating patients using video-based educational materials with a voiceover has on patient preferences compared to traditional text, and (2) whether this impact is consistent between two countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A video-based educational tool was developed to inform patients prior to completing a discrete choice experiment assessing preferences for glucose monitors. Patients with diabetes from the Netherlands and Poland were recruited through an online research panel. Respondents were randomised to receive information in either a text or a video with animations and a voiceover. Data were analysed using a mixed-logit model. RESULTS: N = 981 completed surveys were analysed from the Netherlands (n = 459) and Poland (n = 522). Differences were found between the countries, but no interpretable pattern of differences was found between the two types of educational materials. Patients spent less time in the educational material than would be necessary to fully review all of the content. CONCLUSIONS: Simply providing educational material in a video with animations and voiceovers does not necessarily lead to better engagement from respondents or different preference outcomes in a sample of diabetes patients when compared to text. Increasing engagement with educational materials should be a topic of future research for those conducting patient preference research as no amount of educational material will be helpful if respondents do not access it.",1
Mechanical Thrombectomy for Acute and Subacute Blocked Arteries and Veins in the Lower Limbs: A Health Technology Assessment.,"BACKGROUND: A blockage to the blood vessels in the lower extremities may cause pain and discomfort. If left unmanaged, it may lead to amputation or chronic disability, such as in the form of post-thrombotic syndrome. We conducted a health technology assessment of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) devices, which are proposed to remove a blood clot, which may form in the arteries or veins of the lower legs. This evaluation considered blockages in the veins and arteries separately, and included an evaluation of effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, the budget impact of publicly funding MT for lower limb blockages, patient preferences and values, and clinical and health system stakeholders' perspectives. METHOD: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the Cochrane tool for randomized controlled trials or the risk of bias among non-randomized studies (RoBANS) tool for nonrandomized studies, and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature search. We did not conduct a primary economic evaluation since the clinical evidence is highly uncertain. We also analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding MT treatment for inpatients with arterial acute limb ischemia and acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower limb in Ontario. To contextualize the potential value of MT, we spoke with people with acute DVT. To understand the barriers and facilitators of accessing MT, we surveyed clinical and health system stakeholders to gain their perspectives. RESULTS: We included 40 studies (3 randomized controlled trials and 37 observational studies) in the clinical evidence review. For patients who experience arterial acute limb ischemia, compared with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) alone, MT has greater technical success and patency and reduced hospital length of stay, but the evidence for these outcomes is uncertain (GRADE: Very low). Mechanical thrombectomy may reduce the volume of thrombolytic medication required and CDT infusion time (a determinant for intensive care unit [ICU] need) in patients experiencing acute DVT, but it is uncertain if this is to a meaningful degree (GRADE: Moderate to Very low). It may also reduce the proportion of people who experience post-thrombotic syndrome and overall hospital length of stay, but it is uncertain (GRADE: Very low).We estimated that publicly funding MT for people with arterial acute limb ischemia in Ontario would lead to an annual cost savings of $0.17 million in year 1 to $0.14 million in year 5, for a total savings of $0.83 million over 5 years. This cost savings was mainly attributed to reduced ICU stays among people who received MT, but the results had considerable uncertainty. For the population with acute DVT, publicly funding MT would lead to an additional cost of $0.77 million in year 1 to $1.44 million in year 5, for a total additional cost of $5.5 million over 5 years.The people with acute DVT with whom we spoke reported that MT was generally seen as a positive option, and those who had undergone the procedure reported positively on its value as a treatment to quickly remove a clot. Accessing treatment for DVT could be a barrier, especially in more remote areas of Ontario.Clinicians using the technology advised that facilitators to accessing the technology included perceived improvements in patient outcomes, resourcing requirements, addressing unmet needs, and avoidance of ICU stay. The main barrier identified was cost. Clinicians who were not using the technology advised that barriers were low case-use volume, along with costs for the equipment and for health human resources. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical thrombectomy may have greater technical success and patency and reduce hospital length of stay for patients experiencing an arterial acute limb ischemia and, for patients with an acute DVT, it may reduce CDT volume and infusion time, the proportion of people who experience post-thrombotic syndrome, and hospital length of stay. Mechanical thrombectomy may reduce the associated ICU costs, but it has higher equipment costs compared with usual care. Publicly funding MT in Ontario for populations with arterial acute limb ischemia may not lead to a substantial budget increase to the province. Publicly funding MT for acute DVT would lead to an additional cost of $5.5 million over 5 years. For people with acute DVT, MT was seen as a potential positive treatment option to remove the clot quickly. Overall, the majority of clinical stakeholders we engaged with (including both those with and without experience with MT) were supportive of the use of the technology.",0
[Geographical access to hemodialysis: an analysis of patient choices].,"INTRODUCTION: Patients do not always go to the facility closest to their home. DESCRIPTION: A study was carried out in Provence-Alpes Côtes d'Azur (PACA) on patients' preferences to mobilize the hemodialysis offer. METHODS: The data were extracted from the REIN Registry. Potential access was compared with actual access. A survey was carried out among a sample of patients travelling an additional distance of more than 25 km. RESULTS: About a quarter of the patients did not travel to the nearest facility. Of these, 16.3% travelled an additional distance of over 25 km. Patients' choices were determined by the relationship of trust with the team that first set up dialysis, followed by their desire to be followed in a multi-purpose facility. DISCUSSION: While distance remained the decisive factor, human factors were cited in the majority of cases to explain the bypass. CONCLUSION: The links between the first team and the next one should be strengthened.",0
Orthodontic Aligners: Current Perspectives for the Modern Orthodontic Office.,"Orthodontic aligners are changing the practice of orthodontics. This system of orthodontic appliances is becoming the mainstay appliance of choice for orthodontic offices in many countries. Patient preferences and lifestyle needs have made this appliance the primary choice when seeking care. In the early days, appliances lacked the efficiency and effectiveness of traditional bracket-wire systems, but modern systems are now able to handle a more comprehensive orthodontic caseload. Current systems provide newer biomechanical strategies and artificial intelligence-driven tooth movements for better outcomes. These improvements now mean that an orthodontist can be better prepared to manage a larger number of orthodontic malocclusions. This paper aims to discuss some of the evolution of orthodontic aligners and to describe to orthodontists the fundamentals of aligner therapy. In addition, it will provide an evidence-based outcome to the existing treatment outcomes in the current literature.",0
Patient preferences and comfort for cancer survivorship models of care: results of an online survey.,"PURPOSE: Workforce shortages will impact oncologists' ability to provide both active and survivorship care. While primary care provider (PCP) or survivorship clinic transition has been emphasized, there is little evidence regarding patient comfort. METHODS: We developed an online survey in partnership with patient advocates to assess survivors' comfort with PCP or survivorship clinic care and distributed the survey to online, cancer-specific patient communities from June to August 2020. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 975 surveys were complete. Most respondents were women (91%) and had private insurance (65%). Thirty-six cancer types were reported. Ninety-three percent had a PCP. Twenty-four percent were comfortable seeing a PCP for survivorship care. Higher odds of comfort were seen among respondents who were Black or had stage 0 cancer; female sex was associated with lower odds. Fifty-five percent were comfortable with a survivorship clinic. Higher odds of comfort were seen with lymphoma or ovarian cancer, > 15 years from diagnosis, and non-US government insurance. Lower odds were seen with melanoma, advanced stage, Medicaid insurance, and one late effect. Preference for PCP care was 87% for general health, 32% for recurrence monitoring, and 37% for late effect management. CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of cancer survivors were comfortable with PCP-led survivorship care and about half with a survivorship clinic. Most preferred oncologist care for recurrence monitoring and late-effect management. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Patient preference and comfort should be considered when developing survivorship care models. Future efforts should focus on facilitating patient-centered transitions to non-oncologist care.",0
Dietary Management of Eosinophilic Esophagitis.,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic immune-mediated food antigen-driven disease characterized by tissue eosinophilia and clinical symptoms of esophageal dysfunction. Medical and dietary therapies can be offered as treatment options in both pediatric and adult populations. Advances in nutritional research in EoE have produced different levels of dietary restriction, ranging from elimination of a single food group to more extensive restriction such as the two-food elimination diet, four-food elimination diet, or six-food elimination diet. Efficacy and outcomes vary for each level of restriction. The option of using dietary therapy allows clinicians to partner with patients in shared decision-making to balance the right level of food antigen restriction for the desired outcome. Key considerations when choosing dietary therapy hinge on patient preference and resources, food-related quality of life, and the ability to provide nutritional diversity and maintain nutritional parameters. This article highlights these considerations and offers clinical pearls to guide clinicians who wish to incorporate dietary therapy of EoE into their practice.",0
Cervical preparation for second-trimester procedural abortion.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the evidence-informed options for cervical preparation prior to second-trimester dilation and evacuation (D&E). RECENT FINDINGS: As abortion restrictions increase and the number of abortion clinics and providers decreases, pregnant people are facing more barriers to abortion access. Those in need are now often required to travel for second-trimester abortion care, only to be faced with additional restrictions, such as mandatory waiting periods. Cervical preparation is recommended prior to D&E and takes time for effect. Given the increasing time required to obtain an abortion, patients and providers may prefer same-day cervical preparation to decrease the total time required. Options for same-day cervical preparation include misoprostol alone with single or serial doses, and misoprostol combined with osmotic dilators or transcervical balloon (Foley catheter). Same-day preparation may require additional clinical space to accommodate people after initiation of cervical preparation to manage side-effects and timing of the abortion. Overnight options are also used and more frequently later in the second trimester. Overnight options include mifepristone, osmotic dilators, and transcervical balloon and are often combined with same-day misoprostol. Medication alone preparation is well tolerated and effective in the second trimester, with the addition of mechanical methods with advancing gestation. With many options and combinations being safe and effective, providers can be dynamic and alter approach with supply shortages, adjust to different clinical settings, consider patient medical and surgical factors, and accommodate provider and patient preferences. SUMMARY: Multiple pharmacologic and mechanical options have been shown to be safe and effective for cervical preparation prior to D&E. Consideration for multiple factors should influence the method of cervical preparation and methods may vary by patient, provider and setting.",0
"Exploring herbal remedy utilization for wound healing: Patterns, patient preferences, and implications for nursing practice.","PURPOSE: The utilization of herbal remedies for wound healing is a notable aspect of traditional medicine practices. Understanding herbal use among patients yields insights for nursing care enhancement. This study aimed to investigate the utilization of herbal remedies for wound healing among diabetic patients. METHODS: A total of 453 participants were enrolled, with demographic data, including age, sex, occupation, education level, residence, ethnic group, distance from health service, herbal use duration, and wound duration presented. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data, including means, standard deviations, ranges, and percentages. FINDINGS: The average participant age was 55.39 years, with most being non-civil servant workers (60.3%) and having a low education level (67.1%). Indian almond wood (9.7%) and green betel (6.8%) were the most commonly used herbs for wound healing. Family members were the primary source of information (29.1%), and 43.7% obtained herbs from personal gardens. Although 94.2% of participants did not disclose herbal use to health liaisons, 53.4% used herbs specifically for wound healing. Users reported both positive and negative effects on wounds from various herbs, indicating variability in experiences. However, the consistency of herb usage by individual patients was uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified diverse herbal remedies used for wound healing among patients, driven by familial recommendations. Usage pattern diversity and effects signal necessity for researching herb safety and efficacy. Clarifying the impact of consistent herb usage on wound healing is essential for understanding patients' preferences and practices. IMPLICATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: These findings emphasize the importance of open communication between patients and healthcare providers regarding herbal remedy use. Nurses should acknowledge patients' preferences for traditional healing practices while ensuring they receive evidence-based care. Patient-centered herbal strategies enhance nursing practice, fostering holistic wound care. Further research can guide nursing interventions, facilitate informed decision-making, and improve patient outcomes.",0
"Duration of Follow-up and Timing of Discharge from Imaging Follow-up, in Adult Patients with Urolithiasis After Surgical or Medical Intervention: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis from the European Association of Urology Guideline Panel on Urolithiasi","CONTEXT: No algorithm exists for structured follow-up of urolithiasis patients. OBJECTIVE: To provide a discharge time point during follow-up of urolithiasis patients after treatment. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic review of PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, clinicaltrials.gov, and reference lists according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. Fifty studies were eligible. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: From a pooled analysis of 5467 stone-free patients, we estimated that for a safety margin of 80% for remaining stone free, patients should be followed up using imaging, for at least 2 yr (radiopaque stones) or 3 yr (radiolucent stones) before being discharged. Patients should be discharged after 5 yr of no recurrence with a safety margin of 90%. Regarding residual disease, patients with fragments ≤4 mm could be offered surveillance up to 4 yr since intervention rates range between 17% and 29%, disease progression between 9% and 34%, and spontaneous passage between 21% and 34% at 49 mo. Patients with larger residual fragments should be offered further definitive intervention since intervention rates are high (24-100%). Insufficient data exist for high-risk patients, but the current literature dictates that patients who are adherent to targeted medical treatment seem to experience less stone growth or regrowth of residual fragments, and may be discharged after 36-48 mo of nonprogressive disease on imaging. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that stone-free patients with radiopaque or radiolucent stones should be followed up to 2 or 3 yr, respectively. In patients with residual fragments ≤4 mm, surveillance or intervention can be advised according to patient preferences and characteristics, while for those with larger residual fragments, reintervention should be scheduled. PATIENT SUMMARY: Here, we review the literature regarding follow-up of urolithiasis patients. Patients who have no stones after treatment should be seen up to 2-3 yr, those with large fragments should be reoperated, and those with small fragments could be offered surveillance with imaging.",0
Patient Preferences Regarding Surgical Treatment Methods for Symptomatic Uterine Fibroids.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to rank the factors that are most and least important to patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids when considering surgical treatment options. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a best worst scaling (BWS) preference elicitation approach, participants completed an online survey to rank factors associated with fibroid surgical treatments. Survey content was based on a literature review and included the following factors: symptom relief; surgical complications; repeat treatment; recovery time; cosmetic effects; risk of spreading undiagnosed cancer; sexual outcomes; maintenance of child-bearing; continuation of menses; unpredictable menses; and location of procedure. Participants completed 11 BWS tasks. For each task, we presented participants with a subset of 5 factors from the possible 11, and participants chose the most important and least important factor. Participants' responses were analyzed using conditional logistic regression to determine the relative importance of factors. Patient priorities were further explored via age and race. RESULTS: 285 respondents with symptomatic uterine fibroids (69 physician-confirmed and 216 self-reported) who had not undergone prior surgical treatment completed the survey. Respondents were enrolled from two clinical sites (clinical site cohort) and an online consumer panel (panel cohort). Both cohorts identified symptom relief, cancer risk, repeat treatment and complications as the most important factors in selecting surgical treatment options and location of procedure, return to normal activities after surgery, and cosmetic effects like presence of a scar after the surgical treatment as the least important factors. Of note, younger women (≤ 40) placed greater importance on the ability to have children after the procedure. CONCLUSION: Information regarding the factors most and least important to patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids might inform development and regulatory evaluation of new technologies and procedures. Study results may be useful in efforts to develop a set of outcomes to include in future fibroids clinical studies.",1
Preoperative Breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging: An Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario) Clinical Practice Guideline.,"BACKGROUND: The use of preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after the diagnosis of breast cancer by mammography and/or ultrasound is inconsistent. METHODS: After conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing preoperative breast MRI versus no MRI, we reconvened to prepare a clinical practice guideline on this topic. RESULTS: Based on the evidence that MRI improved recurrence, decreased the rates of reoperations (re-excisions or conversion mastectomy), and increased detection of synchronous contralateral breast cancer, we recommend that preoperative breast MRI should be considered on a case-by-case basis in patients diagnosed with breast cancer for whom additional information about disease extent could influence treatment. Based on stronger evidence, preoperative breast MRI is recommended in patients diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma for whom additional information about disease extent could influence treatment. For both recommendations, the decision to proceed with MRI would be conditional on shared decision-making between care providers and the patient, taking into account the benefits and risks of MRI as well as patient preferences. Based on the opinion of the Working Group, preoperative breast MRI is also recommended in the following more specific situations: (a) to aid in surgical planning of breast conserving surgery in patients with suspected or known multicentric or multifocal disease; (b) to identify additional lesions in patients with dense breasts; (c) to determine the presence of pectoralis major muscle/chest wall invasion in patients with posteriorly located tumours or when invasion of the pectoralis major muscle or chest wall is suspected; (d) to aid in surgical planning for skin/nipple-sparing mastectomies, autologous reconstruction, oncoplastic surgery, and breast conserving surgery with suspected nipple/areolar involvement; and (e) in patients with familial/hereditary breast cancer but who have not had recent breast MRI as part of screening or diagnosis.",0
"A Randomized, Prospective, Observer-Masked Study Comparing Dropless Treatment Regimen Using Intracanalicular Dexamethasone Insert, Intracameral Ketorolac, and Intracameral Moxifloxacin versus Conventional Topical Therapy to Control Postoperative Pain and ","PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical efficacy and patient preference for a dropless treatment regimen compared to conventional topical therapy in patients undergoing cataract surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective, contralateral eye study, patients with bilateral cataract were randomized to receive either intracanalicular dexamethasone insert, intracameral phenylephrine 1%/ketorolac 0.3%, and intracameral moxifloxacin (50 µg) (study group) or topical moxifloxacin 0.5%, ketorolac 0.5%, and prednisolone acetate 1.0% QID (control group). The second eye underwent cataract surgery 2 weeks later and was treated with the opposite treatment. All patients were evaluated at Days 1, 7, 14, 28, and 3 months. The primary outcome measure was postoperative ocular pain. Secondary outcomes included summed ocular inflammation score (SOIS; the sum of the mean anterior chamber cells and anterior flare score), the patient preference for medication protocol between the two eyes, and patient out-of-pocket cost of medications. Safety outcome measures included CDVA, intraocular pressure, central retinal thickness (CRT), and the incidence of reported AEs. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with no pain was similar in both groups at all postoperative visits (p>0.05). No statistically significant difference in SOIS score was observed between the two groups at any visit. A strong majority of the patients (94.7%) preferred the study eye's dropless regimen over the control eye's conventional topical therapy regimen. No statistically significant difference in mean intraocular pressure (IOP) was observed at any postoperative visit, except at Week 1. The mean CDVA was also similar in both groups at all postoperative visits (p>0.05). The postoperative mean CRT was comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSION: A dropless treatment regimen is as effective as topical eyedrop administration. A higher proportion of patients who underwent bilateral cataract surgery preferred the dropless treatment regimen over the patient-administered eye drop regimen.",0
Determining patient preferences in the treatment of medication-refractory overactive bladder.,"INTRODUCTION: Overactive bladder (OAB) is often suboptimally addressed by behavioral or pharmacological treatments. Less than 15% of patients choose to pursue advanced OAB therapy (sacral nerve stimulation [SNS], percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation [PTNS], and bladder onabotulinum toxin type-A [BTX-A]). We seek to better understand which factors are most important to patients when choosing a third-line therapy. METHODS/MATERIALS: We developed a conjoint analysis survey that included five attributes of the third-line options for OAB (SNS, PTNS, and BTX-A). We administered the survey to new patients with urinary incontinence at two institutions. A hierarchical Bayes random effects regression analysis was used to determine the relative importance of the attributes. A choice simulator was used to model which third-line treatment options patients preferred. We followed patients to see if they pursued their predicted treatment. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients completed the study of whom 89% were women. There was representation from all age groups. The most important attributes of decision-making were the frequency of future procedures, the risk of catheterization, and the need for a device. On market simulation, SNS was the preferred treatment option (47%), followed by PTNS (29%) and BTX-A (14%). Only 10% of patients did not find any treatment option acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent follow-up, risk of catheterization, and the need for a device were the most important attributes when making a decision on third-line OAB therapy. On market simulation, SNS is the preferred treatment for all age groups though the ultimate choice in third-line therapy may be affected by external factors.",1

The Place of Immune Reconstitution Therapy in the Management of Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis in France: An Expert Consensus.,"The treatment strategy in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) is a complex decision requiring individualization of treatment sequences to maximize clinical outcomes. Current local and international guidelines do not provide specific recommendation on the use of immune reconstitution therapy (IRT) as alternative to continuous immunosuppression in the management of RMS. The objective of the program was to provide consensus-based expert opinion on the optimal use of IRT in the management of RMS. A Delphi method was performed from May 2022 to July 2022. Nineteen clinical assertions were developed by a scientific committee and sent to 14 French clinical experts in MS alongside published literature. Two consecutive reproducible anonymous votes were conducted. Consensus on recommendations was achieved when more than 75% of the respondents agreed or disagreed with the clinical assertions. After the second round, consensus was achieved amongst 16 out of 19 propositions: 13 clinical assertions had a 100% consensus, 3 clinical assertions a consensus above 75% and 3 without consensus. Expert-agreed consensus is provided on topics related to the benefit of the early use of IRT from immunological and clinical perspectives, profiles of patients who may benefit most from the IRT strategy (e.g. patients with family planning, patient preference and lifestyle requirements). These French expert consensuses provide up-to-date relevant guidance on the use of IRT in clinical practice. The current program reflects status of knowledge in 2022 and should be updated in timely manner when further clinical data in IRT become available.",0

Recent advances and controversial issues in the optimal management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis.,"OBJECTIVE: The optimal management of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis (AsxCS) is enduringly controversial. We updated our 2021 Expert Review and Position Statement, focusing on recent advances in the diagnosis and management of patients with AsxCS. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed up to August 1, 2023, using PubMed/PubMed Central, EMBASE and Scopus. The following keywords were used in various combinations: ""asymptomatic carotid stenosis,"" ""carotid endarterectomy"" (CEA), ""carotid artery stenting"" (CAS), and ""transcarotid artery revascularization"" (TCAR). Areas covered included (i) improvements in best medical treatment (BMT) for patients with AsxCS and declining stroke risk, (ii) technological advances in surgical/endovascular skills/techniques and outcomes, (iii) risk factors, clinical/imaging characteristics and risk prediction models for the identification of high-risk AsxCS patient subgroups, and (iv) the association between cognitive dysfunction and AsxCS. RESULTS: BMT is essential for all patients with AsxCS, regardless of whether they will eventually be offered CEA, CAS, or TCAR. Specific patient subgroups at high risk for stroke despite BMT should be considered for a carotid revascularization procedure. These patients include those with severe (≥80%) AsxCS, transcranial Doppler-detected microemboli, plaque echolucency on Duplex ultrasound examination, silent infarcts on brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography scans, decreased cerebrovascular reserve, increased size of juxtaluminal hypoechoic area, AsxCS progression, carotid plaque ulceration, and intraplaque hemorrhage. Treatment of patients with AsxCS should be individualized, taking into consideration individual patient preferences and needs, clinical and imaging characteristics, and cultural, ethnic, and social factors. Solid evidence supporting or refuting an association between AsxCS and cognitive dysfunction is lacking. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal management of patients with AsxCS should include BMT for all individuals and a prophylactic carotid revascularization procedure (CEA, CAS, or TCAR) for some asymptomatic patient subgroups, additionally taking into consideration individual patient needs and preference, clinical and imaging characteristics, social and cultural factors, and the available stroke risk prediction models. Future studies should investigate the association between AsxCS with cognitive function and the role of carotid revascularization procedures in the progression or reversal of cognitive dysfunction.",0
