Advance Care Planning in South Korea.,"South Korea is an Asian country with a very low birth rate and a large elderly population. Nearly half of deaths are in the elderly over the age of 80, and cancer is the leading cause of all deaths. As the aging population increases, interest in end-of-life (EOL) care and quality of death is growing, but South Korea is one of the Asian countries that traditionally feels burdened by discussing death openly. In particular, even when a person is suffering from an incurable disease and is about to die, it is customary for the family members to make decisions without directly informing the patient of the disease status or discussing life-sustaining treatment (LST). However, due to a series of social events, the importance of individual autonomy, good death, discontinuation of LSTs, and advance care planning (ACP) gradually spread, and eventually the Life-Sustaining Treatment Decisions Act was implemented in 2018. With the enactment of this law, patients' autonomy was enhanced in a short period of time, and a legal basis was established to discontinue LST at the EOL. However, there are still many areas to be improved, and it is fundamentally necessary to spread the concept of 'ACP' within society.",0
Interdisciplinary care of pediatric oncology patients: A survey of clinicians in Central America and the Caribbean.,"BACKGROUND: Quality cancer care depends on interdisciplinary communication. This study explored the communication practices of interdisciplinary clinicians, the types of healthcare services for which they engage in interdisciplinary collaboration, and the association between interdisciplinary care and perceived quality of care, as well as job satisfaction. METHODS: We conducted a survey of interdisciplinary clinicians from cancer centers in Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, El Salvador, and Haiti. The survey included 68 items including previously validated tools and novel questions. RESULTS: Total 174 interdisciplinary clinicians completed the survey: nurses (n = 60), medical subspecialists (n = 35), oncologists (n = 22), psychosocial providers (n = 20), surgeons (n = 12), pathologists (n = 9), radiologists (n = 9), and radiation oncologists (n = 5). Oncologists reported daily communication with nurses (95%) and other oncologists (91%). While 90% of nurses reported daily communication with other nurses, only 66% reported daily communication with oncologists, and more than 50% of nurses reported never talking to pathologists, radiologists, radiation oncologists, or surgeons. Most clinicians described interdisciplinary establishment of cancer treatment goals and prognosis (84%), patient preferences (81%), and determination of first treatment modality (80%). Clinicians who described more interdisciplinary collaboration had higher job satisfaction (p = .04) and perceived a higher level of overall quality of care (p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians in these limited resource settings describe strong interdisciplinary collaboration contributing to higher job satisfaction and perceived quality of care. However, nurses in these settings reported more limited interdisciplinary communication and care. Additional studies are necessary to further define clinical roles on interdisciplinary care teams and their associations with patient outcomes.",0
A meta-analysis on the role older adults with cancer favour in treatment decision making.,"INTRODUCTION: In the complex setting of oncological treatment decision making, balancing professional guidance while respecting patient involvement can be a challenge. We set out to assess the role adults with cancer favour in treatment decision making (TDM), including differences across age groups and change over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE and Embase, for studies on role preference of (older) adults with cancer in oncological treatment decision making. A meta-analysis was conducted based on Control Preference Scale (CPS) data, a questionnaire on patient role preference in TDM. RESULTS: This meta-analysis includes 33 studies reporting CPS data comprising 17,197 adults with cancer. Mean age was 60.6 years old for studies that specified age (24 studies, 6155 patients). During the last decade, patients' role preference shifted towards significantly more active involvement in TDM (p = 0.006). No age-dependent subgroup differences have been identified; both younger and older adults, defined as, respectively, below and above 65 years old, favour active involvement in treatment decision making. DISCUSSION: Over time, adults with cancer have shifted towards more active role preference in treatment decision making. In current cancer care, a large majority prefers taking an active role, irrespective of age.",0
Similar Midterm Outcomes of Total Knee Arthroplasties with Anterior and Posterior Tibial Slopes Performed on Paired Knees at a Minimum Follow-up of 5 Years.,"A small posterior tibial slope (PTS) is generally recommended in posterior stabilized (PS) total knee arthroplasty (TKA). An unwanted anterior tibial slope (ATS), which can affect postoperative results, may be created in PS TKA because of the inaccuracy of surgical instruments and techniques, as well as high interpatient variability. We compared midterm clinical and radiographic results of PS TKAs with ATS and PTS performed on paired knees using the same prosthesis. One-hundred-twenty-four patients who underwent TKAs with ATS and PTS on paired knees using ATTUNE posterior-stabilized prostheses were retrospectively reviewed after a minimum follow-up period of 5 years. The mean follow-up period was 5.4 years. The Knee Society Knee and Function scores, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, Feller and Kujalar scores, and range of motion (ROM) were evaluated. The preferred TKA out of ATS and PTS was also investigated. The hip-knee-ankle angle, component positions, tibial slope, posterior femoral offset, Insall-Salvati ratio, and knee sagittal angle were measured by radiography. There were no significant differences in the clinical results, including ROM, between TKAs with ATS and PTS preoperatively and at the last follow-up. Regarding patient preference, 58 patients (46.8%) were satisfied with bilateral knees, 30 (24.2%) preferred knees with ATS, and 36 (29%) preferred knees with PTS. There was no significant difference in the rate of preference between TKAs with ATS and PTS (p = 0.539). Except for the postoperative tibial slope (-1.8 vs. 2.5 degrees, p < 0.001), there were also no significant differences in the radiographic results, including the knee sagittal angle, preoperatively and at the last follow-up. The midterm outcomes were similar between PS TKAs with ATS and PTS performed on paired knees at a minimum of 5 years of follow-up. Nonsevere ATS did not affect midterm outcomes in PS TKA with proper soft tissue balancing and the current prosthesis of improved design. However, a long-term follow-up study is required to confirm the safety of nonsevere ATS in PS TKA. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE::  III.",0
Preferences and Adherence of People with Prediabetes for Disease Management and Treatment: A Systematic Review.,"OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively summarize the evaluation, preference, and expectations of people with prediabetes regarding the management and treatment of pre-diabetes. METHODS: Search PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and CNKI for articles about prediabetes, preferences, and expectations from inception of the database to June 2023. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies involving 17,240 participants with prediabetes were included. Although the preferences and views of people with prediabetes vary widely, there are certain trends: 1) Compared with drug therapy, people with prediabetes prefer exercise and nutrition therapies. 2) People with prediabetes expect intensive lifestyle interventions guided by professionals. 3) Effective communication between doctors and people with prediabetes is crucial for promoting the development and implementation of treatment plans. CONCLUSION: The results of this systematic review showed that people with prediabetes prefer intensive lifestyle interventions due to concerns about drug side effects, dependency, and other factors. In addition, drug acceptance and lifestyle interventions options differed among different populations, which emphasized the significance of individualized therapy.",1
Timing of the Initial Postoperative Care After Cataract Surgery: A Patient's Perspective.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate patient preferences in regards to the timing of the initial postoperative examination after undergoing cataract surgery. METHODS: A retrospective, consecutive case series analysis from a single private practice institution was performed using a standardized phone survey on patients who underwent cataract surgery. Subjects were classified into one of two possible study groups according to the timing of their initial postoperative cataract surgery examination: Group A received the initial postoperative cataract surgery examination on the same day as the surgery, whereas Group B received the initial postoperative cataract surgery examination on the day following the operation. RESULTS: There were 80 subjects contacted for the phone survey of which 70 (35 in each study group) completed the survey and therefore were included in the analysis. Group A subjects responded favorably in regards to preference and realizing reduced time and cost savings compared to Group B (p < 0.0001 for both). There were no subjects in Group A who would have preferred next-day initial postoperative care, whereas 31.4% of subjects in Group B would have preferred same-day care if given the opportunity. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing cataract surgery both prefer and report time and cost savings with same-day initial postoperative care compared to next-day initial postoperative care. Patient preferences regarding their postoperative care should be one of the many factors that a surgeon ought to take into consideration when providing follow-up care after cataract surgery.",0
The cost of saying no: general practitioners' gatekeeping role in sickness absence certification.,"BACKGROUND: General practitioners (GPs) have an important gatekeeping role in the Norwegian sickness insurance system. This role includes limiting access to paid sick leave when this is not justified according to sick leave criteria. 85% of GPs in Norway operate within a fee-for-service system that incentivises short consultations and high service provision. In this qualitative study, we explore how GPs practise the gatekeeping role in sickness absence certification. METHODS: Qualitative data was collected through six focus group interviews with 33 GPs, working in practices with a minimum of four practising GPs, in different geographical regions across Norway, including both urban and rural areas. Data was analysed using Braune and Clarke's thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Our results indicate that GPs' sick-listing decisions are largely driven by patient demand and preferences for sick leave. GPs reported that they rarely overrule patient requests for sickness absence, including in cases where such requests conflict with the GPs' opinion of whether sick leave is justified or benefits the patient. The degree of effort made to limit unjustified or non-beneficial sick leave seems to depend on the GPs' available time and perceived risk of conflict with the patient. GPs generally expressed dissatisfaction with their role as certifiers of sickness absence. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that GPs' decisions about sickness certification is largely driven by patient preferences. The GPs' gatekeeping function is limited to negotiations about grade and duration of absence spells.",0
Patient preferences of patient selection criteria for upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation: A qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation is a life-enhancing reconstructive treatment option that aims to improve recipients' quality of life and maximize function. This study assessed upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation patient selection criteria perceptions among individuals with upper extremity limb loss. The perceptions of individuals with upper extremity limb loss on patient selection criteria may enable vascularized composite allotransplantation centers to improve criteria to avoid mismatched expectations about the posttransplant vascularized composite allotransplantation experience and outcomes. Realistic patient expectations may increase patient adherence, improve outcomes, and reduce vascularized composite allotransplantation graft loss. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with civilian and military service members with upper extremity limb loss and upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation candidates, participants, and recipients from three US institutions. Interviews assessed perceptions of patient selection criteria for suitability as a candidate for upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation. Thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. RESULTS: A total of 50 individuals participated (66% participation rate). Most participants were male (78%), White (72%), with a unilateral limb loss (84%), and a mean age of 45 years. Six themes emerged regarding upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation patient selection criteria, including support for candidates who: (1) are of younger age, (2) are in good physical health, (3) have mental stability, (4) are willing to ""put in the work,"" (5) have specific amputation characteristics, and (6) have sufficient social support. Patients had preferences about selecting candidates with unilateral versus bilateral limb loss. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that numerous factors, including medical, social, and psychological characteristics, inform patients' perceptions of patient selection criteria for upper extremity vascularized composite allotransplantation. Patient perceptions of patient selection criteria should inform the development of validated screening measures that optimize patient outcomes.",0
Comparing Outcomes of a Discrete Choice Experiment and Case 2 Best-Worst Scaling: An Application to Neuromuscular Disease Treatment.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Case 2 best-worst scaling (BWS-2) is an increasingly popular method to elicit patient preferences. Because BWS-2 potentially has a lower cognitive burden compared with discrete choice experiments, the aim of this study was to compare treatment preference weights and relative importance scores. METHODS: Patients with neuromuscular diseases completed an online survey at two different moments in time, completing one method per occasion. Patients were randomly assigned to either first a discrete choice experiment or BWS-2. Attributes included: muscle strength, energy endurance, balance, cognition, chance of blurry vision, and chance of liver damage. Multinomial logit was used to calculate overall relative importance scores and latent class logit was used to estimate heterogeneous preference weights and to calculate the relative importance scores of the attributes for each latent class. RESULTS: A total of 140 patients were included for analyses. Overall relative importance scores showed differences in attribute importance rankings between a discrete choice experiment and BWS-2. Latent class analyses indicated three latent classes for both methods, with a specific class in both the discrete choice experiment and BWS-2 in which (avoiding) liver damage was the most important attribute. Ex-post analyses showed that classes differed in sex, age, level of education, and disease status. The discrete choice experiment was easier to understand compared with BWS-2. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that using a discrete choice experiment and BWS-2 leads to different outcomes, both in preference weights as well as in relative importance scores, which might have been caused by the different framing of risks in BWS-2. However, a latent class analysis revealed similar latent classes between methods. Careful consideration about method selection is required, while keeping the specific decision context in mind and pilot testing the methods.",1
Development of a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure to assess patient perceptions of simplicity and complexity of treatment for type 2 diabetes.,"INTRODUCTION: Treatments for type 2 diabetes vary widely in their complexity. The simplicity or complexity of a treatment regimen may have an impact on patient preference, treatment adherence, and health outcomes. The purpose of this qualitative study was to develop two draft patient-reported outcome instruments focusing on patients' experience with simplicity and complexity of treatment for type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The instruments were developed in a series of steps: gather information to support development of a concept elicitation interview guide (literature review and expert interviews), concept elicitation interviews with patients (N = 30), cognitive interviews with patients (N = 20), and a translatability assessment. RESULTS: In concept elicitation interviews, patients with type 2 diabetes reported a range of treatment attributes that influence their perceptions of treatment simplicity and complexity, such as injection devices, medication preparation, dose timing, dose frequency, ease of taking the correct dose, flexibility of dose schedule, remembering to take medication, and food requirements. Two draft questionnaires were developed based on the literature review, expert interviews, and concept elicitation interviews with patients. Revisions were made to these draft instruments based on qualitative interviews with patients and translatability assessment. DISCUSSION: The qualitative research conducted in this study supports the content validity of two newly developed instruments, the Simplicity of Diabetes Treatment Questionnaire (Sim-Q) and the Simplicity of Diabetes Treatment Questionnaire-Comparison (Sim-Q-Comp), designed to assess the simplicity and complexity of diabetes treatment from the patient's perspective.",0
Evidence-based treatment of Achilles tendon rupture.,"The treatment of Achilles tendon rupture has recently seen a shift toward non-operative management, as supported by the literature, yet many surgeons continue to treat these injuries operatively. The evidence clearly supports non-operative management of these injuries except for Achilles insertional tears and for certain patient groups, such as athletic patients, for whom further research is warranted. This nonadherence to evidence-based treatment may be explained by patient preference, surgeon subspecialty, surgeon era of practice or other variables. Further research to understand the reasons behind this nonadherence would help to promote conformity in the surgical community across all specialties and adherence to evidence-based approaches.",0
A Discrete Choice Experiment to Assess Patient Preferences for Asthma Rescue Therapy and Disease Management.,"BACKGROUND: With the expanding treatment landscape for asthma, the process of identifying best-fit, individualized management options is becoming increasingly complicated. Understanding patients' preferences can inform shared decision-making between clinicians and patients. OBJECTIVES: To examine preferences of adults with asthma for therapeutic and management attributes and determine how these preferences vary among patients. METHODS: We conducted an online discrete choice experiment survey in US adults with asthma. Patient preferences were analyzed using logit models. Factors affecting patients' preferences were identified by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1,184 patients completed the survey (60% female; mean [SD] age, 49.2 [15.0] years). Patients most valued fewer asthma attacks requiring urgent health care professional visits, fewer exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids, and a reduced risk for oral thrush. Higher value was placed on reducing the risk of short-term (oral thrush) versus long-term side effects (diabetes). Patients were willing to increase rescue medication use in exchange for decreasing exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and attacks requiring urgent health care professional visits. Patients preferred a single inhaler for rescue and maintenance and least valued asthma action plans. Demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors affected patient preferences. CONCLUSIONS: Patients sought convenient management options that focused mainly on decreasing the short-term morbidity associated with asthma exacerbations and therapies. Preferences varied by demographics, clinical factors, and socioeconomics. It is important for shared decision-making discussions to include conversations about morbidity and how available therapeutic options align with individual patient preferences.",1
Preferred Conversation Topics with Respect to Treatment Decisions Among Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.,"PURPOSE: Greater knowledge of individuals' needs and preferences can enhance shared decision-making, which is associated with improved quality of decisions and increased satisfaction. This study aimed to identify and prioritize the attributes (ie conversation topics) that individuals with type 2 diabetes find it most important to discuss with their healthcare provider regarding treatment decisions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: First, small group interviews were organized with adults with type 2 diabetes (N=8) treated in primary care to identify the attributes that they find important to discuss regarding treatment decisions. A five-step nominal group technique was applied during the interviews. An object best-worst scaling (BWS) survey was subsequently distributed to individuals with self-reported diabetes participating in the Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel of the Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (N=600) to determine the relative importance score (RIS) of the identified attributes. A higher RIS indicates a higher level of perceived importance. Subgroup and latent class analyses were performed to explore whether individuals' demographic and disease characteristics influenced their attribute preferences. RESULTS: A total of 21 attributes were identified during three small group interviews with individuals with type 2 diabetes. Respondents in the BWS survey (N=285) viewed ""quality of life"" (RIS=11.97), ""clinical outcomes"" (RIS=10.40), ""long-term diabetes complications"" (RIS=9.83) and ""short-term adverse medication"" (RIS=7.72) as the most important in the decision-making process for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Some differences in attribute preferences were identified according to demographic and disease characteristics. CONCLUSION: In general, individuals with type 2 diabetes not only want to discuss the biological effects of treatments, but also the impact of treatment on their quality of life. Healthcare providers should be aware that attributes are viewed differently by different individuals. This emphasizes the need for tailor-made healthcare decisions, which means eliciting and responding to individual preferences in the decision-making process.",1
Changing patient preferences toward better trial recruitment: an ethical analysis.,"While randomized controlled trials are essential to health research, many of these trials fail to recruit enough participants. Approaching recruitment through the lens of behavioral science can help trialists to understand influences on the decision to participate and use them to increase recruitment. Although this approach is promising, the use of behavioral influences during recruitment is in tension with the ethical principle of respect for persons, as at least some of these influences could be used to manipulate potential participants. In this paper, we examine this tension by discussing two types of behavioral influences: one example involves physician recommendations, and the other involves framing of information to exploit cognitive biases. We argue that despite the apparent tension with ethical principles, influencing trial participants through behavior change strategies can be ethically acceptable. However, we argue that trialists have a positive obligation to analyze their recruitment strategies for behavioral influences and disclose these upfront to the research ethics committee. But we also acknowledge that since neither trialists nor ethics committees are presently well equipped to perform these analyses, additional resources and guidance are needed. We close by outlining a path toward the development of such guidance.",0
"Effectiveness and Tolerability of Ectoin(®) Mouth and Throat Spray Althaea Honey (ERS09) for Sore Throat due to Acute Pharyngitis and Dry Cough: A Multicentre, Actively Controlled, Open Label Study in Germany.","Acute pharyngitis can cause sore throat. This multicentre, active-controlled, randomised, open-label, and parallel-group study, conducted according to the German Medical Devices Act, compared the effectiveness and tolerability of ERS09 mouth and throat spray with a well-established device for the treatment of sore throat caused by acute pharyngitis and dry cough. Patients were randomised 1:1 into ERS09/comparator groups (EMSER(®) Sore Throat Spray) for 7 ± 2 days. Patients and investigators reported effectiveness (change in total symptom score [TSS]) and safety endpoints (incidence of adverse events [AEs]; adverse device effects [ADEs]). A total of 186 patients were included (ERS09: n = 92; comparator: n = 94). The baseline-adjusted mean TSS over 7 days was -90.14 and -74.91 in the ERS09 and comparator groups, respectively (p < 0.05). The majority of patients reached a 50% reduction in symptoms by day 6 (ERS09 = 78.85; comparator = 75.8%). Most patients reported a soothing effect within five minutes (ERS09 = 82%; comparator = 71%). Improvements in individual symptoms were similar with no significant differences between groups; more patients in the ERS09 group reported an improvement in pharyngeal redness/swelling. Three AEs unrelated to medication, one ADE following ERS09, and no serious AE/ADE were reported. ERS09 was as well tolerated and effective as the established device, showing greater improvement in the management of some symptoms and greater patient preference.",0
Patients' preferences for secondary prevention following a coronary event.,"OBJECTIVE: Despite clear evidence on the effectiveness of secondary prevention, patients with coronary artery disease frequently fail to reach guideline-based risk factor targets. Integrating patients' preferences into treatment decisions has been recommended to reduce this gap. However, this requires knowledge about patient treatment preferences. Therefore, through a survey study, we aimed to explore which risk factors patients self-perceived, prioritised for improvement, and needed support with after a recent hospitalisation for coronary heart disease. METHODS: A digital questionnaire was presented to patients > 18 years recently discharged (≤3 months) from an acute coronary care unit in the Netherlands (Europe). Patients could select from eight cardiovascular risk factors that they (1) self-perceived, (2) prioritised for improvement, and (3) needed support to improve. Patients' perceived risk factors were compared to those documented in the medical records. RESULTS: Respondents (N = 254, 26 % women), mean age 64 (SD 10) years, identified 'physical inactivity' more frequently than their medical records (140 patients vs. 91 records, p < 0.001), while three other risk factors were reported with equal and four with lower frequency. 'Physical inactivity', 'overweight' and 'stress' were most frequently prioritised for improvement (82 %, 88 % and 78 %) and professional support (64 %, 50 % and 58 %), with 87 % preferring lifestyle optimisation if this would reduce drug use. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a recent coronary event show significant disparities in identifying risk factors compared to their medical records. They tend to prefer improving lifestyle- over drug-modifiable risk factors, particularly physical inactivity, overweight and stress, and indicate the need for support in improving these factors.",0
Out-of-Pocket Cost Modeling of Adjuvant Radiation Therapy Duration in Standard-of-Care Early Stage Breast Cancer Treatment Across Medicaid and Medicare Plans.,"PURPOSE: For early stage breast cancer (BC), the choice of radiation therapy duration (1 vs 3 weeks) is highly debated. Cost and financial toxicity are major concerns that patients with BC face. Nonetheless, there remain limited discussions providing granular details of the role of insurance in the aggregate cost of 1 week versus 3 weeks of radiation therapy for patients. This project aims to disaggregate costs by plan to increase transparency of out-of-pocket (OOP) cost estimates in radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Treatment procedures were determined through the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. OOP treatment costs, deductibles, and copays/coinsurance were calculated by using Medicaid, Original Medicare, Medigap Plan G, and Medicare Part D prescription plans. The medicare.gov, medicaid.oh.gov, aarpmedicareplans.com, and the physician fee schedule from cms.gov were used to determine costs by treatment. Price estimates reflect actual costs per insurance plan rather than costs estimated from claims data. All procedures were considered to be performed in an Ohio hospital setting. One-week radiation therapy was defined as 5 fractions without boost, and 3-week radiation therapy was defined as 15 fractions without boost. RESULTS: Medicare beneficiaries with Original Medicare coverage face an OOP treatment charge of $649.24 for 1 week of radiation therapy and $1006.20 for 3 weeks of radiation therapy. Assuming the deductible is met postlumpectomy, Medigap Plan G beneficiaries are faced with no additional charges for both lengths of radiation therapy. Similarly for Medicaid beneficiaries (assuming treatment is approved by Medicaid), all expenses are covered without limit, resulting in no OOP expense. CONCLUSIONS: Considerations of 1 and 3 weeks of radiation therapy for postlumpectomy early-stage BC are often dependent on cancer characteristics and patient preferences. This model (based on actual cost estimates per insurance plan rather than claims data) compares OOP costs across Medicaid and Medicare plans, which more holistically informs providers and patients in radiation therapy duration decision making.",0
Telemedicine in a spine clinic setting: a large survey of patient preferences and experiences.,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has greatly disturbed healthcare and the practice of neurosurgery. As healthcare systems evolve in the face of COVID-19, the use of telehealth platforms has expanded. We presented the results of a large survey of patient perspectives on the role of telehealth in the care of spine clinic patients. METHODS: All patients at the spine clinic of a large, tertiary, academic medical center were surveyed at their clinic visit from May 30, 2020-June 30, 2020. All responses were anonymous, and results were analyzed with standard statistical techniques. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-six surveys were returned and 164 were entirely completed. 56.8% of patients were new while 24.4% were postoperative follow-up visits: 54.9% had lumbar symptoms. 85% had pain while more than half also reported weakness; 58% traveled greater than twenty-five miles for their appointment; 96% had transportation readily available. Of all respondents, only 15.3% preferred the appointment via video telehealth while 4% had no preference between in-person appointment or virtual visit. Preference for telehealth appointment was not associated with factors such as new or established in the practice, spinal region of symptoms, pain, weakness, comfort with technology, age, or duration of symptoms. There was a significant difference between how far the patient traveled for the clinic appointment and their preference for a telehealth appointment, with patients traveling further distances favoring telehealth (P=0.04). This effect remained significant when stratifying based on 25 miles (P=0.03) or 50 miles (P=0.03) but not when stratifying based on 100 miles (P=0.32). However, the sample size of patients traveling >100 miles was small, limiting any inference regarding that subgroup. Access to transportation was associated with preference for telehealth (88.89% vs. 97.18%, P=0.08) but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Most spine patients prefer in-person clinic appointments to virtual appointments. These preferences should be considered when arranging patient encounters.",0
American Gastroenterological Association-American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Practice Guideline: Pharmacological Management of Chronic Idiopathic Constipation.,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is a common disorder associated with significant impairment in quality of life. This clinical practice guideline, jointly developed by the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology, aims to inform clinicians and patients by providing evidence-based practice recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of CIC in adults. METHODS: The American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that conducted systematic reviews of the following agents: fiber, osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol, magnesium oxide, lactulose), stimulant laxatives (bisacodyl, sodium picosulfate, senna), secretagogues (lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide), and serotonin type 4 agonist (prucalopride). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework to assess the certainty of evidence for each intervention. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop clinical recommendations based on the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 10 recommendations for the pharmacological management of CIC in adults. Based on available evidence, the panel made strong recommendations for the use of polyethylene glycol, sodium picosulfate, linaclotide, plecanatide, and prucalopride for CIC in adults. Conditional recommendations were made for the use of fiber, lactulose, senna, magnesium oxide, and lubiprostone. DISCUSSION: This document provides a comprehensive outline of the various over-the-counter and prescription pharmacological agents available for the treatment of CIC. The guidelines are meant to provide a framework for approaching the management of CIC; clinical providers should engage in shared decision making based on patient preferences as well as medication cost and availability. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted to help guide future research opportunities and enhance the care of patients with chronic constipation.",0
"Contracting retail pharmacies as a source of essential medicines for public sector clients in low- and middle-income countries: a scoping review of key considerations, challenges, and opportunities.","BACKGROUND: Insurances in high-income countries (HIC) often contract with private community pharmacies to dispense medicines to outpatients. In contrast, dispensing of medicines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) often lacks such contractual arrangements. Furthermore, many LMICs lack sufficient investment in supply chains and financial and human resources to guarantee stock levels and services at public medicine-dispensing institutions. Countries striving to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) can, in principle, incorporate retail pharmacies into their supply chains to expand access to essential medicines (EMs). The objectives of this paper are (a) to identify and analyze key considerations, opportunities and challenges for public payers when contracting out the supply and dispensing of medicines to retail pharmacies and (b) to provide examples of strategies and policies to address these challenges. METHODS: A targeted literature strategy was used to conduct this scoping review. We created an analytical framework of key dimensions: (1) governance (including medicine and pharmacy regulation); (2) contracting (3) reimbursement; (4) medicine affordability (5) equitable access; and (6) quality of care (including 'patient-centered' pharmaceutical care). Using this framework, we selected a mix of three HIC and four LMIC case studies and analyzed the opportunities and challenges encountered when contracting retail pharmacies. RESULTS: From this analysis, we identified a set of opportunities and challenges that should be considered by public payers considering public-private contracting: (1) balancing business viability with medicine affordability; (2) incentivizing equitable access to medicines; (3) ensuring quality of care and delivery of services; (4) ensuring product quality; (5) task-sharing from primary care providers to pharmacies and (6) securing human resources and related capacity constraints to ensure sustainability of the contract. CONCLUSION: Public-private partnerships offer opportunities to improve access to EMs. Nonetheless, managing these agreements is complex and is influenced by a variety of factors. For effective contractual partnerships, a systems approach is needed in which business, industry and regulatory contexts are considered in tandem with the health system. Special attention should be devoted to rapidly changing health contexts and systems, such as changes in patient preferences and market developments brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.",0
Adequate menstrual suppression in adolescents with inherited bleeding disorders often requires multiple treatment changes: Retrospective cohort study of a multidisciplinary clinic.,"Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is often the presenting symptom for females with inherited bleeding disorders (IBD). Multidisciplinary clinics leverage the expertise of hematologists and women's health specialists. This study characterizes the complexity of HMB management for adolescents with IBDs from a large multidisciplinary clinic. Adolescents often required multiple different menstrual suppression treatments, with only about 20% achieving acceptable suppression with their first treatment. Adolescents switched therapy most often for uncontrolled bleeding, followed by adverse effects, and patient preference. Given the difficulty in achieving adequate menstrual suppression, multidisciplinary clinics offer necessary expertise in accomplishing bleeding control with minimal adverse effects.",0
Uptake of BRCA1/BRCA2 predictive genetic testing in an Irish population is low: a missed opportunity.,"INTRODUCTION: Predictive testing for BRCA1 or BRCA2 allows at-risk individuals to engage with appropriate screening and treatment services if a pathogenic mutation is identified. Previous studies have shown uptake of predictive testing to most commonly range between 20% and 40% (Table 2). This represents a missed cancer prevention opportunity. Possible explanations for this low uptake include lack of disclosure of at-risk status to relatives, lack of awareness of cancer genetics services, or patient preference. The goal of the current study was to investigate the uptake of BRCA1 or BRCA2 predictive testing in an Irish population. METHODS: We performed a multicentre, retrospective analysis of 63 pedigrees from two Irish tertiary referral hospitals over a five-year period (2012-2017). Family pedigrees were reviewed to identify at-risk family members eligible for predictive BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation testing as per international guidelines, and testing rates were determined. RESULTS: A total of 1048 eligible individuals were identified, 318 (30.4%) proceeded to BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline testing including [215 (37.5%) females and 99 males (21.5%)]. Women were significantly more likely to test than men (T = 3.7, p < .0002). Uptake of testing was significant higher amongst first-degree relatives 45% (150/323) compared to 20% (50/258) amongst second degree relatives, and 10 % (33/317) amongst more distant relatives (F = 25.32, p < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Uptake of BRCA1 OR BRCA2 mutation testing in Ireland is suboptimal, particularly amongst Irish males and distant relatives. Further research is needed to identify strategies which may improve uptake within current legal and ethical frameworks.",0
Patient preferences for atopic dermatitis treatments: a discrete choice experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) experience skin lesions and intense itch that substantially affect quality of life. Patients have choices among systemic AD treatments that offer varied benefit-risk profiles. OBJECTIVE: Measure patients' willingness to trade off the risks and benefits of systemic treatments among individuals with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of moderate-to-severe AD. METHODS: Patients participated in a discrete choice experiment online survey with a series of choices between hypothetical AD treatments defined by six attributes reflecting benefits and risks of treatments (itch reduction, time until noticeable itch reduction, chance of clear or almost clear skin, risk of serious infection, risk of developing acne, and need for prescription topical steroids). Data were analyzed with a random parameters logit model to quantify preferences and the relative importance of attributes for treatment alternatives. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 200) placed the highest relative importance on itch reduction, speed of itch reduction, and skin clearance, and were generally willing to accept clinically relevant levels of risk of serious infection and acne in exchange for treatment benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with moderate-to-severe AD were willing to trade clinically relevant treatment risks for greater or more rapid itch reduction and skin clearance offered by systemic therapies.",1
Risk thresholds for patients to switch between daily tablets and biweekly infusions in second-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a patient preference study.,"BACKGROUND: Historically, high hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-related mortality has been, in part, due to lack of effective therapies; however, several systemic therapies have been recently approved for HCC treatment, including regorafenib and ramucirumab. These two treatments utilize different routes of administration (four daily tablets and biweekly intravenous infusions, respectively) and have different risks of adverse events (AEs). However, we lack data on patient preferences in balancing the route of administration and risk of AEs in patients with HCC. We aimed to determine patient preferences and trade-offs for second-line treatment in patients with HCC.  METHODS: Patients with advanced or metastatic HCC were recruited through their physicians for this study. Patient preferences were assessed by using a modified threshold technique (TT) design in which respondents were asked two direct-elicitation questions before (assuming same safety and efficacy and only varying mode of administration) and after (incorporating the safety profiles of ramucirumab and regorafenib) the TT series on seven risks of clinically relevant AEs. RESULTS: In total, of the 157 patients recruited by their physicians, 150 were eligible and consented to participate. In the first elicitation question (assuming risk and efficacy were equivalent), 61.3% of patients preferred daily tablets. However, 76.7% of patients preferred the biweekly infusion when the safety profiles of the two available second-line therapies were included. The TT analysis confirmed that preferences for oral administration were not strong enough to balance out the risk of AEs that differentiate the two therapies. DISCUSSION: We found that when patients were asked to choose between a daily, oral medication and a biweekly IV medication for HCC, they were more likely to choose a daily, oral medication if efficacy and safety profiles were the same. However, when risks of AEs representing the safety profiles of two currently available second-line treatments were introduced in a second direct-elicitation question, respondents often selected an IV administration with a safety profile similar to ramucirumab, rather than oral tablets with a safety profile similar to regorafenib. Our findings indicate that the risk profile of a second-line treatment for HCC may be more important than the mode of administration to patients.",1
Similar outcomes of arteriovenous fistulae created under general or regional anesthesia.,"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that type of anesthesia can significantly change vascular access surgery outcomes. Still, there is limited evidence on the impact of regional anesthesia (RA) on patency and failure rates compared to general anesthesia (GA). The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of RA and GA in patients who underwent vascular access creation at our center. METHODS: Data collected in our prospectively maintained database of patients with chronic renal dysfunction requiring hemodialysis were analyzed, 464 patients were included. Outcome parameters such as maturation, primary failure, postoperative flow measurements, patency rates, and survival outcomes were compared between RA and GA groups. RESULTS: In this study 489 vascular access procedures were performed in 464 patients, 318 included in the RA group and 171 in the GA group. Median follow-up time was 29.9 (IQR 37.3) months in the RA group versus 33.0 (IQR 40.7) in the GA group (p = 0.252). Anesthesia type did not significantly affect patient survival (HR, 1.01; CI, 0.70-1.45; p = 0.976). No significant differences were found in vascular access flow volume, primary failure, or time to cannulation between the RA and GA groups for both radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae and brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae. Anesthesia type did not significantly change patency outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, both RA and GA demonstrate similar results regarding patient survival, maturation, failure, or patency after vascular access creation. Still, patient-specific factors for each type of anesthesia as well as patient preference should be considered.",0
Quality of prenatal and postpartum telehealth visits during COVID-19 and preferences for future care.,"BACKGROUND: At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth practices for pregnancy-related care were rapidly implemented. Telehealth for pregnancy-related care is likely to continue after the pandemic. In order for health systems and clinicians to provide person-centered pregnancy-related care via telehealth, it is critical to understand patients' telehealth experiences and their preferences regarding the use of telehealth moving forward. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe perceived quality of prenatal and postpartum telehealth visits during COVID-19 and to examine the association between telehealth quality during the pandemic and future telehealth preferences. STUDY DESIGN: We used data from of an online sample of US women aged 18 to 45 years seeking reproductive health care during COVID-19. Two cross-sections of survey data were collected in July 2020 and January 2021. This analysis included those who sought prenatal (n=1496) or postpartum (n=482) care during the pandemic. Among those who had a prenatal or postpartum telehealth visit, we used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between a measure of perceived telehealth quality and openness to future telehealth visits, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 57.5% of prenatal and 52.9% of postpartum respondents had a telehealth appointment. Respondents agreed with most statements about the quality of their telehealth appointments, with ≥80% reporting that they were convenient, easy, safe, and provided good information. Lower-ranked quality items were related to visits feeling personal and the patient feeling cared for. A total of 35.2% of prenatal (n=816) and 43.3% of postpartum (n=231) respondents expressed openness to telehealth visits in the future. Prenatal and postpartum respondents reporting higher telehealth quality had increased odds of being open to telehealth in the future (prenatal: adjusted odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-1.3; postpartum: adjusted odds ratio, 1.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.3). CONCLUSION: Prenatal and postpartum respondents with better telehealth experiences were more likely to express openness to telehealth in the future, although most preferred future in-person visits. As pregnancy-related telehealth continues, it is important to offer appointment options that match patient preferences, especially populations that face barriers in access to care, and to explore ways to personalize care and support positive patient-provider relationships.",0
Patients who have undergone total shoulder arthroplasty prefer greater surgeon involvement in shared decision making.,"BACKGROUND: There has been a shift in medical decision making from a paternalist model to a shared decision-making (SDM) approach, described as a patient-physician relationship where both parties collaborate to arrive on an evidence-based treatment regimen that best suits the patient's needs and values. However, there is a scarcity in evidence regarding SDM in shoulder arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to evaluate overall patient preference for SDM and determine demographic and socioeconomic factors related to SDM preference in those undergoing shoulder arthroplasty. METHODS: Patients aged 40-89 years who had undergone a total shoulder arthroplasty were enrolled. Two-part questionnaires were administered collecting patient demographic information and SDM subscale scores postoperatively. Bivariate and multivariate regression models were used to determine factors associated with SDM Total and subscale scores. RESULTS: A total of 125 patients (53 male; mean age, 69.5 ± 10.4 years) who had undergone primary total shoulder arthroplasty were included. The mean Total SDM score was -2.24 ± 1.9 and the Preoperative, Operative, and Postoperative SDM subscale scores were -1.54 ± 2.0, -2.59 ± 2.2, and -2.48 ± 2.1, respectively, indicating a preference for SDM in the Preoperative subscale and surgeon-driven decision making in the total score and other 2 subscales. Multivariate regression models demonstrated a preference for surgeon decision making at both the 4-12-week postoperative period for the Preoperative subscale (odds ratio [OR] -1.03, 95% CI -2.0, -0.1, P = .039) and the 2-4-week postoperative period for the Operative subscale (OR -1.74, 95% CI -3.4, -0.1, P = .038) when compared to patients at the 2-week postoperative period. No other variables were significantly associated with any of the SDM subscale scores or Total SDM score. CONCLUSION: Patients reported a more passive role in the decision-making process with an overall preference for a surgeon-led approach in primary total shoulder arthroplasty. Patients preferred a shared decision-making approach in regard to preoperative considerations but indicated a significant preference for surgeon-led decision making regarding day of surgery decisions. There were no correlations between SDM scores and age, sex, race, income, education level, insurance type, or treating surgeon. Overall, patients demonstrated a predilection for an SDM approach for preoperative considerations, contrary to those decisions associated with the day of surgery and postoperative care.",0
A scoping review on two-stage randomized preference trial in the field of mental health and addiction.,"BACKGROUND: Randomized Controlled Trial is the most rigorous study design to test the efficacy and effectiveness of an intervention. Patient preference may negatively affect patient performance and decrease the generalizability of a trial to clinical population. Patient preference trial have particular implications in the field of mental health and addiction since mental health interventions are generally complex, blinding of intervention is often difficult or impossible, patients may have strong preference, and outcome measures are often subjective patient self-report which may be greatly influenced if patient's preference did not match with the intervention received. METHODS: In this review, we have surveyed the application of two-stage randomized preference trial with focus on studies in the field of mental health and addiction. The study selection followed the guideline provided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. RESULTS: Six two-stage randomized preference trials (ten publications) have been identified in the field of mental health field and addiction. In these trials, the pooled dropout rates were 18.3% for the preference arm, and 28.7% for the random arm, with a pooled RR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56-0.88; P = 0.010) indicating lower risk of dropout in the preference arm. The standardized preference effects varied widely from 0.07 to 0.57, and could be as large as the treatment effect in some of the trials. CONCLUSION: This scoping review has shown that two-stage randomized preference trials are not as popular as expected in mental health research. The results indicated that two-stage randomized preference trials in mental health would be beneficial in retaining patients to expand the generalizability of the trial.",0
Accentuating patient values in shared decision-making: A mixed methods development of an online value clarification tool and communication training in the context of early phase clinical cancer trials.,"OBJECTIVE: In the shared decision-making (SDM) process for potential early phase clinical cancer trial participation, value clarification is highly recommended. However, exploration and discussion of patient values between patients and oncologists remains limited. This study aims to develop an SDM-supportive intervention, consisting of a preparatory online value clarification tool (OnVaCT) and a communication training. METHODS: The OnVaCT intervention was developed and pilot-tested by combining theoretical notions on value clarification, with interview studies with patients and oncologists, focus groups with patient representatives and oncologists, and think aloud sessions with patients, following the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for complex interventions. These human-centered methodologies enabled a user-centered approach at every step of the development process of the intervention. RESULTS: This study shows relevant patient values and oncologists' perspectives on value exploration and discussion in daily practice. This has been combined with theoretical considerations into the creation of characters based on real-life experiences of patients in the OnVaCT, and how the tool is combined with a communication training for oncologists to improve SDM.",0
Patient preferences for heart valve disease intervention.,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine how patients trade-off the benefits and risks of two different types of procedures used to treat heart valve disease (HVD). It also aimed to determine patients' preferences for HVD treatments (predicted uptake) and the relative importance of each treatment attribute. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in Australia and Japan with patients who required a heart valve procedure. Patients were stratified into three categories: no prior procedure experience, minimally invasive procedure experience and invasive procedure experience. DCE attributes included risk of mortality; risk of stroke; needing dialysis; needing a new pacemaker; valve durability; independence 1 month after surgery; and out-of-pocket expenses. Participants chose between two hypothetical labelled approaches to therapy ('invasive procedure' and 'minimally invasive procedure'), with a separate opt-out included. A mixed multinomial logit model was used to analyse preferences. RESULTS: The DCE was completed by 143 Australian and 206 Japanese patients. Both populations demonstrated an overall preference for the minimally invasive procedure over the invasive procedure. All attributes tested significantly predicted choice and were important to patient decision-making. However, patients' choices were most influenced by the durability of the valve and the likelihood of independence postprocedure, irrespective of their prior procedure experience. Differences in preference were observed between Australian and Japanese patients; valve durability was the most important attribute among Australian patients, while Japanese patients emphasised regaining independence postsurgery. Risk of mortality was less important relative to other key attributes in Japan; however, it remained significant to the model. CONCLUSIONS: HVD patients prefer a minimally invasive procedure over an invasive procedure, irrespective of prior treatment experience. Key attributes contributing to treatment preferences are valve durability and faster recovery. These results can be used to help inform healthcare decision-makers about what features of heart valve procedures patients value most. PATIENT AND PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: People with lived experience of HVD were included in multiple stages of the design phase of this research. First, patients and doctors were consulted by taking part in qualitative interviews. The qualitative interviews helped inform which treatment attributes to include in the DCE based on what was important to those with lived experience and those who help make treatment decisions on behalf of patients. Qualitative interview participants also assisted with the framing of questions in the online survey to ensure the terminology was patient-friendly and relevant to those with lived experience. Following qualitative interviews, the DCE attribute list was agreed on in expert consultation with a steering committee, which included patient representatives and treating physicians (interventional cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons). The survey was also pilot tested with a small sample of patients and minor adjustments were made to the wording to ensure it was appropriate and meaningful to those with lived experience of HVD.",1
Breast filler granuloma mistaken for implant rupture: A case report.,"RATIONALE: Breast augmentation is usually performed by inserting implants into the breasts. However, injectable fillers are sometimes used for the convenience of both patients and surgeons. If foreign substances, such as biomaterials, are injected into the body, complications such as inflammation, granuloma, and tissue necrosis can occur owing to foreign body reactions. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 39-year-old female patient visited our hospital complaining of tenderness, redness, and swelling in both breasts. The patient had undergone bilateral breast augmentation using implants 4 years prior to current consult. DIAGNOSES: On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cystic lesions and fluid collections were observed, with findings suggesting implant rupture; hence, surgery was planned to remove both implants. INTERVENTIONS: Intraoperatively, the implant was malpositioned in the upper lateral portion without rupture. Capsular contracture findings were also not prominent. A large amount of inflammatory granuloma was observed and removed in the prepectoral plane, and the implants were immediately inserted into a new subpectoral plane. OUTCOMES: The volume of the new implant was 175 mL, which was smaller than the previous one, as per the patient preference. Cytology of the fluid from the previous implant pocket showed no evidence of malignancy, and the granuloma was identified as inflammatory tissue caused by a foreign body reaction on biopsy. The excessive protrusion of both breasts was corrected after surgery, and the patient was satisfied with the aesthetic outcomes without any complications up to 3 months after surgery. LESSONS: The use of injectable fillers for breast augmentation carries the risk of misdiagnosis, and, therefore, surgeons should always exercise caution.",0
Valued Outcomes in the Cancer Experience (VOICE)™: Development and validation of a multidimensional measure of perceived control.,"OBJECTIVE: Enhancing cancer patients' sense of control can positively impact psychological well-being. We developed and assessed the psychometric properties of Valued Outcomes in the Cancer Experience (VOICE)(TM), a measure of patients' perceived control over key personal priorities within their cancer experience. METHODS: VOICE construction and testing were completed in three phases with separate participant samples: (1) item generation and initial item pool testing (N = 459), (2) scale refinement (N = 623), and (3) confirmatory validation (N = 515). RESULTS: A 21-item measure was developed that captures cancer patients' sense of control in seven key domains: (1) Purpose and Meaning, (2) Functional Capacity, (3) Longevity, (4) Quality Care, (5) Illness Knowledge, (6) Social Support, and (7) Financial Capability. VOICE demonstrated adequate internal consistency (full-scale α = 0.93; factor α = 0.67-0.89) and adequate to strong convergent and discriminatory validity. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: VOICE measures cancer patients' perceived control across a diverse range of personal priorities, creating a platform for elevating patient perspectives and identifying pathways to enhance patient well-being. VOICE is positioned to guide understanding of the patient experience and aid the development and evaluation of supportive care interventions to enhance well-being.",0
Phases and Transitions of Serious Illness: A Structure for Teaching Palliative Care.,"BACKGROUND: Palliative care (PC) focuses on listening to patient preferences, goals, and values to help health care providers educate, support, and collaborate during challenging disease processes, demanding treatments, and difficult decision-making. METHOD: A recently developed Phases and Transitions Model for Serious Illness helps guide nursing students in initiating therapeutic conversations about PC. Each phase and transition shows unique characteristics of illness and treatment to clarify the importance of introducing PC for that phase. Interventions in education, support, and treatment help students guide patients and families through the trajectory of serious illness. RESULTS: The Phases and Transitions Model for Serious Illness and PC interventions provide a clear and practical structure to educate and empower nursing students to engage in PC conversations. CONCLUSION: Nursing educators can integrate this new model to broaden the perspective of PC as an everyday nursing practice for patients who have a serious illness.

Estimation of Intangible Costs for Factors Associated with Oral Antiviral Drugs for COVID-19 Treatment: A Conjoint Analysis in Japan.,"INTRODUCTION: During the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, preferences for factors associated with vaccines have been evaluated. Three oral antiviral drugs have been approved in Japan for patients with mild-to-moderate I COVID-19 symptoms. Although preferences for the drugs may also depend on various factors, these have not been fully evaluated. METHODS: A conjoint analysis was performed based on an online survey in August 2022 to estimate the intangible costs of factors associated with oral antiviral drugs for COVID-19. Respondents were individuals aged 20-69 across Japan. The attributes included the company (Japanese/foreign) that developed the drug, formulation and size of the drug, frequency of administration per day, number of tablets/capsules per dose, number of days until no longer infectious to others, and out-of-pocket expenses. A logistic regression model was applied to estimate the utility of each level for each attribute. The intangible costs were calculated by comparing the utility to the out-of-pocket attribute. RESULTS: Responses were collected from 11,303 participants. The difference between levels was the largest for companies that developed a drug; the intangible costs were JPY 5390 higher for the foreign company than for the Japanese company. The next largest difference was in the number of days until one is no longer infectious. For the same formulation, the intangible cost was lower for small sizes than large sizes. For similar-sized tablets and capsules, the intangible cost was lower for tablets than capsules. These tendencies were similar regardless of COVID-19 infection history and the presence of risk factors for severe COVID-19 in the respondents. CONCLUSION: Intangible costs for factors associated with oral antiviral drugs among the Japanese population were estimated. The results may change as the number of people with a history of COVID-19 infection increases and significant progress is made regarding treatments.",1
"Society of Surgical Oncology Breast Disease Site Working Group Statement on Contralateral Mastectomy: Indications, Outcomes, and Risks.","Rates of contralateral mastectomy (CM) among patients with unilateral breast cancer have been increasing in the United States. In this Society of Surgical Oncology position statement, we review the literature addressing the indications, risks, and benefits of CM since the society's 2017 statement. We held a virtual meeting to outline key topics and then conducted a literature search using PubMed to identify relevant articles. We reviewed the articles and made recommendations based on group consensus. Patients consider CM for many reasons, including concerns regarding the risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC), desire for improved cosmesis and symmetry, and preferences to avoid ongoing screening, whereas surgeons primarily consider CBC risk when making a recommendation for CM. For patients with a high risk of CBC, CM reduces the risk of new breast cancer, however it is not known to convey an overall survival benefit. Studies evaluating patient satisfaction with CM and reconstruction have yielded mixed results. Imaging with mammography within 12 months before CM is recommended, but routine preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging is not; there is also no evidence to support routine postmastectomy imaging surveillance. Because the likelihood of identifying an occult malignancy during CM is low, routine sentinel lymph node surgery is not recommended. Data on the rates of postoperative complications are conflicting, and such complications may not be directly related to CM. Adjuvant therapy delays due to complications have not been reported. Surgeons can reduce CM rates by encouraging shared decision making and informed discussions incorporating patient preferences.",0
A Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Patients With Acute Spinal Cord Injury: Recommendations on Hemodynamic Management.,"STUDY DESIGN: Clinical practice guideline development following the GRADE process. OBJECTIVES: Hemodynamic management is one of the only available treatment options that likely improves neurologic outcomes in patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Augmenting mean arterial pressure (MAP) aims to improve blood perfusion and oxygen delivery to the injured spinal cord in order to minimize secondary ischemic damage to neural tissue. The objective of this guideline was to update the 2013 AANS/CNS recommendations on the hemodynamic management of patients with acute traumatic SCI, acknowledging that much has been published in this area since its publication. Specifically, we sought to make recommendations on 1. The range of mean arterial pressure (MAP) to be maintained by identifying an upper and lower MAP limit; 2. The duration of such MAP augmentation; and 3. The choice of vasopressor. Additionally, we sought to make a recommendation on spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP) targets. METHODS: A multidisciplinary guideline development group (GDG) was formed that included health care professionals from a wide range of clinical specialities, patient advocates, and individuals living with SCI. The GDG reviewed the 2013 AANS/CNS guidelines and voted on whether each recommendation should be endorsed or updated. A systematic review of the literature, following PRISMA standards and registered in PROSPERO, was conducted to inform the guideline development process and address the following key questions: (i) what are the effects of goal-directed interventions to optimize spinal cord perfusion on extent of neurological recovery and rates of adverse events at any time point of follow-up? and (ii) what are the effects of particular monitoring techniques, perfusion ranges, pharmacological agents, and durations of treatment on extent of neurological recovery and rates of adverse events at any time point of follow-up? The GDG combined the information from this systematic review with their clinical expertise in order to develop recommendations on a MAP target range (specifically an upper and lower limit to target), the optimal duration for MAP augmentation, and the use of vasopressors or inotropes. Using methods outlined by the GRADE working group, recommendations were formulated that considered the balance of benefits and harms, financial impact, acceptability, feasibility and patient preferences. RESULTS: The GDG suggested that MAP should be augmented to at least 75-80 mmHg as the ""lower limit,"" but not actively augmented beyond an ""upper limit"" of 90-95 mmHg in order to optimize spinal cord perfusion in acute traumatic SCI. The quality of the evidence around the ""target MAP"" was very low, and thus the strength of this recommendation is weak. For duration of hemodynamic management, the GDG ""suggested"" that MAP be augmented for a duration of 3-7 days. Again, the quality of the evidence around the duration of MAP support was very low, and thus the strength of this recommendation is also weak. The GDG felt that a recommendation on the choice of vasopressor or the use of SCPP targets was not warranted, given the dearth of available evidence. CONCLUSION: We provide new recommendations for blood pressure management after acute SCI that acknowledge the limitations of the current evidence on the relationship between MAP and neurologic recovery. It was felt that the low quality of existing evidence and uncertainty around the relationship between MAP and neurologic recovery justified a greater range of MAP to target, and for a broader range of days post-injury than recommended in previous guidelines. While important knowledge gaps still remain regarding hemodynamic management, these recommendations represent current perspectives on the role of MAP augmentation for acute SCI.",0
Patient evaluation of gynaecological information provision and preferences.,"AIM: To evaluate gynaecological patients' preferences and satisfaction regarding information provision, exploring enablers and barriers to information access. DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional survey design was used. METHODS: A total of 293 women accessing gynaecological services responded to the survey. Quantitative analysis included descriptive and inferential statistics. Content analysis was conducted on qualitative data. RESULTS: Health professionals were the most common and preferred sources of gynaecological health information. Enablers to information provision included positive communication strategies by health professionals, participants having prior knowledge and doing their own research. Despite its widespread availability, only 24.2% of women preferred the internet as an information source. Poor communication and inadequate information provision were identified as barriers to information access. Statistically significant associations were identified between location of residence, education level, year of birth, diagnostic group and health information preferences. Recommendations from women included improved communication strategies, system changes and provision of individualized information. CONCLUSION: Health professionals are central to women accessing information about gynaecological diagnoses. Areas for improvement include communication strategies, facilitating access to internet-based resources for information and consideration of women's preferences when providing health information. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND PATIENT CARE: Consumer co-design of gynaecological health information and communication training for health professionals is recommended. Improved communication and facilitated use of internet-based resources may improve women's understanding of information. IMPACT: This study explored gynaecological patients' preferences and satisfaction regarding information provision, exploring enablers and barriers to information access. It was found that gynaecological patients preferred individualized information provided to them directly by health professionals and despite its widespread availability, the internet is an underutilized health information resource. These findings are applicable to health professionals and patients utilizing tertiary gynaecological health services in Australia but may be generalized if demographic data aligns with other jurisdictions. REPORTING METHOD: The STROBE reporting method was used in the preparation of the manuscript. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No patient or public contribution.",0

Patient Preferences for Pharmaceutical and Device-Based Treatments for Uncontrolled Hypertension: Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Discrete choice experiment is a survey method used to understand how individuals make decisions and to quantify the relative importance of features. Using discrete choice experiment methods, we quantified patient benefit-risk preferences for hypertension treatments, including pharmaceutical and interventional treatments, like renal denervation. METHODS: Respondents from the United States with physician-confirmed uncontrolled hypertension selected between treatments involving a procedure or pills, using a structured survey. Treatment features included interventional, noninterventional, or no hypertension treatment; number of daily blood pressure (BP) pills; expected reduction in office systolic BP; duration of effect; and risks of drug side effects, access site pain, or vascular injury. The results of a random-parameters logit model were used to estimate the importance of each treatment attribute. RESULTS: Among 400 patients completing the survey between 2020 and 2021, demographics included: 52% women, mean age 59.2±13.0 years, systolic BP 155.1±12.3 mm Hg, and 1.8±0.9 prescribed antihypertensive medications. Reduction in office systolic BP was the most important treatment attribute. The remaining attributes, in decreasing order, were duration of effect, whether treatment was interventional, number of daily pills, risk of vascular injury, and risk of drug side effects. Risk of access site pain did not influence choice. In general, respondents preferred noninterventional over interventional treatments, yet only a 2.3 mm Hg reduction in office systolic BP was required to offset this preference. Small reductions in office systolic BP would offset risks of vascular injury or drug side effects. At least a 20% risk of vascular injury or drug side effects would be tolerated in exchange for improved BP. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in systolic BP was identified as the most important driver of patient treatment preference, while treatment-related risks had less influence. The results indicate that respondents would accept interventional treatments in exchange for modest reductions in systolic BP compared with those observed in renal denervation trials.",1
Comparing quality of recovery and satisfaction between spinal anesthesia and nerve block in orthopedic below-knee surgery: A prospective controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative quality of recovery (QoR) and patient satisfaction have gained increasing significance in medical services. This study aimed to compare these 2 parameters between 2 types of regional anesthetics (spinal anesthesia and combined sciatic-femoral nerve block) in orthopedic lower knee surgery. METHODS: A total of 101 patients were classified into 2 groups (combined sciatic-femoral nerve block, group N; spinal anesthesia, group S) according to patient preference. In group N, sciatic and femoral nerve blocks were performed on the popliteal and groin regions, respectively, under ultrasound guidance. Spinal anesthesia was performed in group S. The primary outcomes were QoR and patient satisfaction. QoR was measured using the Korean translation of the QoR-15K. Patient satisfaction was assessed using an 11-point Likert scale (0-10) and a dichotomous question addressing anesthesia preferences for future surgeries. RESULTS: The physical independence of the postoperative QoR-15K was significantly higher in group N than in group S (14.2 vs 12.0, P = .04). On the 11-point Likert scale, group N scored 8.8, and group S scored 7.8 (P = .001). In the dichotomous question, 93.8% of the group N and 52.8% of the group S answered that they would like to choose the same anesthesia method for the next surgery (P < .001). In addition, fewer participants in group N complained of backache than those in group S, and the time to first urination after anesthesia was shorter in group N than in group S (P = .004, <.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Combined sciatic-femoral nerve block may provide better physical independence and satisfaction than spinal anesthesia in orthopedic below-knee surgeries.",0
The ampulla of Vater: A potential target for metastatic melanoma?,"Malignant melanomas are aggressive cancers that can prove to be fatal, with Australia harbouring the highest incidence of skin cancers worldwide. Surprisingly, as little as 13.4% of patients undergoing surgical resection of high-risk melanomas remain disease-free after 2 years, with 31.6% showing evidence of distant spread. Although rare, secondary tumours of the ampulla of Vater have been documented, with the most common primaries involving breast, renal and melanoma cancers. We report the case of a malignant melanoma of the ampulla of Vater occurring in a patient 4-year post-surgical resection of a Stage II melanoma manifesting as acute pancreatitis with obstructive jaundice. Given the rarity of secondary ampullary tumours, metastatic melanoma should always be considered in patients with obstructive jaundice and a history of melanoma resection. In the absence of distant disease, surgery may be considered after consensus at multidisciplinary team meetings and after consideration of the patient preference.",0
What Features of Fertility Treatment do Patients Value? Price Elasticity and Willingness-to-Pay Values from a Discrete Choice Experiment.,"BACKGROUND: Infertility is a medical condition affecting an estimated 186 million people worldwide. Medically assisted fertility treatments allow many of these individuals to have a baby. Insights about preferences of patients who have experienced fertility treatment should be used to inform funding policies and treatment configurations that best reflect the patients' voice and the value of fertility treatment to patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore the preferences for fertility treatment attributes of infertile women who had previously undergone or were undergoing fertility treatments-ex post perspective. METHODS: We used data from a stated-preference discrete choice experiment (DCE) among 376 Australian women who had undergone or were undergoing fertility treatment. Respondents chose their preferred treatment choices in 12 hypothetical treatment choice scenarios described by seven attributes (success rates, side effects, counselling/peer support, treatment journey, continuity of care, availability of experimental treatment and out-of-pocket cost). We estimated random parameter logit (RPL) and latent class (LC) models that accounted for preference heterogeneity. The results were used to derive price elasticities of demand and marginal willingness-to-pay (WTP) values for the treatment attributes explored within the DCE survey. RESULTS: Income level did not have a significant effect on marginal WTP for fertility treatment attributes. The demand for fertility treatment from an ex post perspective was found to be highly inelastic (treatment cost changes had almost no impact on demand). Success rates and out-of-pocket costs were significant and important predictors of individuals' treatment choices conditional on the attributes and levels included in the study. These were followed by counselling/peer support, side effects, treatment journey, continuity of care, and availability of experimental treatment, in that order. Respondents were willing to pay $383-$524 per one percentage point increase in the treatment success rate and over $2000 and over $3500 to avoid moderate and significant side effects, respectively (values are reported in AU$). Latent class models revealed that the majority of respondents (51%) were risk-averse success-rate seekers. CONCLUSION: Infertile women who had previously undergone or were undergoing fertility treatment valued fertility treatment highly as reflected by highly price-inelastic demand. Success rate of treatment and out-of-pocket costs were the most important attributes and largely determined patients' WTP for fertility treatment relative to the attributes and levels used in the study. While further research should investigate the price sensitivity of women who have not experienced fertility treatment, these results might explain why women continue fertility treatment once they have commenced despite their financial capacity to pay. Future research should also determine patients' price elasticities for a fertility treatment program with multiple treatment cycles.",1
Hartmann's procedure in rectal cancer surgery is often an intraoperative decision: a retrospective multicenter study.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate patient-related factors predicting the selection of rectal cancer patients to Hartmann's procedure as well as to investigate how often, and on what grounds, anterior resection is intraoperatively changed to Hartmann's procedure. METHODS: Prospectively collected data from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry regarding patients with rectal cancer operated upon from January 1 2007 to June 30 2017 in the county of Skåne were retrospectively reviewed. Data were expanded with further details from medical charts. A univariable analysis was performed to investigate variables associated with unplanned HP and significant variables included in a multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Altogether, 1141 patients who underwent Hartmann's procedure (275 patients, 24%), anterior resection (491 patients, 43%), or abdominoperineal resection (375 patients, 33%) were included. Patients undergoing Hartmann's procedure were significantly older and had more frequently comorbidity. The decision to perform Hartmann's procedure was made preoperatively in 209 (76%) patients, most commonly because of a comorbidity (27%) or oncological reasons (25%). Patient preference was noted in 8% of cases. In 64 cases (23%), the decision was made intraoperatively, most often due to anastomotic difficulties (60%) and oncological reasons (22%). Anastomotic difficulties were most often reported due to technical difficulties, a low tumor or neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Male gender was a significant risk factor for undergoing unplanned Hartmann's procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The decision to perform Hartmann's procedure was frequently made intraoperatively. Hartmann's procedure should be considered and discussed preoperatively in old and frail patients, especially in the presence of mid-rectal cancer and/or male gender, since these factors increase the risk of intraoperative anastomotic difficulties.",0
Comparative study of different combinations of mirabegron and antimuscarinics in treatment for overactive bladder syndrome in elderly patients.,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the therapeutic efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and patient preference in elderly patients with overactive bladder (OAB) receiving different combinations of mirabegron and solifenacin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Elderly OAB patients received mirabegron 25 mg (M25) daily for 1 month (1M) followed by randomization to receive M25 (Group 1), mirabegron 50 mg (M50, Group 2), solifenacin 5 mg (S5, group 3); or M25 plus S5 (Group 4) for further 2 months. Efficacy and AEs were evaluated. At the end of 3M, patients' preferred option for future treatment was investigated. RESULTS: A total of 168 patients were enrolled, and 100 completed 3-month treatment. At 1M, all parameters improved significantly except postvoid residual (PVR), 23 (13.7%) patients had no symptom, 16 (9.5%) had no improvement, and 10 (6.0%) withdrew from the trial. Compared parameters at 3M with 1M revealed that quality of life, Patient's Perception of Bladder Condition scores, and voided volume improved significantly in group 1; the OAB Symptom Score (OABSS) increased in group 2; mean PVR and Global Response Assessment (GRA) deteriorated in group 3; and the OABSS and GRA improved in group 4. At 3M, the AEs prevalence increased significantly in group 3. Only 38.1% in group 4 preferred long-term usage of combination therapy. CONCLUSION: M25 daily is effective and safe in treating elderly OAB patients. Dose escalation to 50 mg or shifting to S5 does not increase the therapeutic efficacy. Combining M25 with S5 provides better treatment efficacy but is associated with lower patient compliance than M25 alone.",0
Suboptimal Clinical and Quality of Life Outcomes in Patients with Psoriasis Undertreated with Oral Therapies: International Physician and Patient Survey.,"INTRODUCTION: Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, immune-mediated disease. This study assessed the time at which patients switched from a conventional oral systemic treatment to a biologic therapy; patient clinical and quality of life (QoL) outcomes associated with oral systemic treatments; and the proportion of patients who persisted on oral therapy (nonswitchers), despite reported suboptimal clinical and QoL outcomes. METHODS: This data analysis used the Adelphi Real World Psoriasis Disease Specific Programme, a non-interventional, retrospective, cross-sectional survey conducted in the USA, France, Germany, and United Kingdom (August 2018-April 2019). Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis assessed switching from oral to biologic therapy in patients treated ≥ 3 years at survey completion (n = 597). The severity of psoriasis was reported by physicians as the percentage of body surface area (BSA) affected by psoriasis. Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores were calculated for three groups: nonswitchers who met treatment failure criteria, nonswitchers who did not meet failure criteria, and switchers to a biologic therapy. RESULTS: In KM analysis, approximately 50% of the patient population switched by 24 months. A substantial portion of nonswitchers continued to have moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Among nonswitchers, 57-77% had BSA ≥ 3% and 16-24% had BSA ≥ 10% at the time of the survey compared with 37% of switchers who had BSA of ≥ 3% and 9% who had BSA of ≥ 10%. QoL was poor among nonswitchers. The mean [standard deviation (SD)] DLQI scores for nonswitchers meeting treatment failure criteria, nonswitchers not meeting failure criteria, and switchers were 6.11 (4.55), 2.62 (3.29), and 2.25 (4.23), respectively. CONCLUSION: There is a clear unmet need for more effective oral therapies, and further research into the reasons for patients remaining undertreated, which may include patient preference for oral treatments (despite lack of response), contraindications, or insurance/formulary-related barriers to access, are needed.",0
Factors Associated With Comfort Using Telemedicine for Upper Limb Specialty Care.,"PURPOSE: There is a growing interest in diagnosis and treatment through telemedicine because of its convenience, accessibility, and lower costs. There are clinician and patient barriers to wider adoption of telemedicine. To support the effective and equitable use of telemedicine, we investigated the patient, illness, and surgeon factors associated with the specialist level of comfort in providing upper limb care via telemedicine. METHODS: Seventy-five upper-extremity musculoskeletal specialists completed an online survey-based experiment in which they viewed 12 patient scenarios with randomized patient age, gender, diagnosis, pain intensity, and patient preference for surgical treatment (yes or no) and rated their comfort with telemedicine from 0, no comfort, to 10, complete comfort. The participants were able to provide a rationale for their stance in open text boxes. We recorded the following specialist factors: gender, location of practice, years in practice, subspecialty, the supervision of trainees, and surgeon-rated importance of a physical examination. RESULTS: In a multivariable analysis, greater surgeon comfort using telemedicine was associated with nontrauma conditions, four specific diagnoses, and patients who did not have severe pain. Lower surgeon comfort with telemedicine was associated with the higher clinician-rated importance of a hands-on physical examination and supervising trainees. Text-based reasons provided for relative comfort with telemedicine included nonsurgical treatment and facility of diagnosis based on interviews alone. Text-based reasons for relative discomfort with telemedicine included a perceived need for a hands-on physical examination and a preference for an in-person conversation for specific discussions, including scheduling surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Greater specialist enthusiasm for telemedicine is associated with personal preferences regarding the upper-extremity condition, patients with less severe pain, and a willingness to forego a hands-on examination. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Utilization of telemedicine for upper-extremity specialty care may be facilitated by diagnosis-specific care strategies and strategies for video examination, with a focus on tactics that are effective for people with more intense symptoms.",0
Use of expectant management based on prostate cancer risk and health status: How far are we from a risk-adapted approach?,"OBJECTIVES: While active surveillance, a form of expectant management (EM), is preferred for patients with low-risk prostate cancer (PCa), some favor a more risk-adapted approach that recognizes patient preferences and condition-specific factors. However, previous research has shown non-patient-related factors often drive PCa treatment. In this context, we characterized trends in AS with respect to disease risk and health status. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using SEER-Medicare data, we identified men 66 years and older diagnosed with localized low- and intermediate-risk PCa from 2008 to 2017 and examined receipt of EM, defined as the absence of treatment (i.e., surgery, cryotherapy, radiation, chemotherapy, and androgen deprivation therapies) within 1 year of diagnosis. We performed bivariable analysis to compare trends in use for EM vs. treatment, stratified by disease risk (i.e., Gleason 3+3, 3+4, 4+3; PSA<10, 10-20) and health status (i.e., NCI Comorbidity Index (NCI), frailty, life expectancy). We then ran a multivariable logistic regression model to examine determinants of EM. RESULTS: Within this cohort, 26,364 (38%) were categorized as low-risk (i.e., Gleason 3+3 and PSA<10) and 43,520 (62%) as intermediate-risk (i.e., all others). Over the study period, use of EM significantly increased across all risk groups, except for Gleason 4+3 (P = 0.662), as well across all health status groups. However, linear trends did not differ significantly between frail vs. nonfrail patients for both those categorized as low-risk (P = 0.446) and intermediate-risk (P = 0.208). Trends also did not differ between NCI 0 vs. 1 vs. >1 for low-risk PCa (P = 0.395). In the multivariable models, EM was associated with increasing age and being frail for men with both low- and intermediate risk disease. Conversely, EM selection was negatively associated with higher comorbidity score. CONCLUSIONS: EM increased significantly over time for patients with low- and favorable intermediate-risk disease, with the most notable differences based on age and Gleason score. In contrast, trends in uptake of EM did not differ substantively by health status, suggesting that physicians may not be effectively incorporating patient health into PCa treatment decisions. Additional work is needed to develop interventions that recognize health status as an essential component of a risk-adapted approach.",0
A role for immune modulation in achieving functional cure for chronic hepatitis B among current changes in the landscape of new treatments.,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is rarely cured using available treatments. Barriers to cure are: 1) persistence of reservoirs of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and antigen production (HBV DNA); 2) high burden of viral antigens that promote T cell exhaustion with T cell dysfunction; 3) CHB-induced impairment of immune responses. AREAS COVERED: We discuss options for new therapies that could address one or more of the barriers to functional cure, with particular emphasis on the potential role of immunotherapy. EXPERT OPINION/COMMENTARY: Ideally, a sterilizing cure for CHB would translate into finite therapies that result in loss of HBV surface antigen and eradication of HBV DNA. Restoration of a functional adaptive immune response, a key facet of successful CHB treatment, remains elusive. Numerous strategies targeting the high viral DNA and antigen burden and aiming to restore the host immune responses will enter clinical development in coming years. Most patients are likely to require combinations of several drugs, personalized according to virologic and disease characteristics, patient preference, accessibility, and affordability. The management of CHB is a global health priority. Expedited drug development requires collaborations between regulatory agencies, scientists, clinicians, and within the industry to facilitate testing of the best drug combinations.",0
Time to embed physical activity within usual care in cancer services: A qualitative study of cancer healthcare professionals' views at a single centre in England.,"PURPOSE: An increasing number of people affected by cancer (PABC) are living longer lives as treatment continues to advance. There is growing evidence for physical activity (PA) supporting health in this population before, during and after cancer treatment, but PA advice is not part of usual care. This study investigates views of frontline oncology healthcare professionals (HCPs) in one NHS teaching hospital in England to understand the role of PA advice across cancer services. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a qualitative study interviewing HCPs and using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four main themes were identified: 1. Awareness of the roles of PA in cancer; 2. Patient-specific factors in rehabilitation; 3. Cancer-specific factors in rehabilitation; 4. Barriers and opportunities to integrating PA within usual care. HCPs' awareness of the role of PA in cancer rehabilitation was low overall and PA was found not to be embedded within rehabilitation. Contrastingly, there was awareness of PA's potential to impact disease and treatment-related outcomes positively. Ideas for PA integration included training for staff and giving PA advice within consultations. CONCLUSIONS: Low awareness of benefits of PA-based rehabilitation and lack of integration in usual care contrasted with HCPs' interest in this area's potential. Training HCPs to begin the conversation with patients affected by cancer in teachable moments may increase patient access.Implications for rehabilitationIntegrating physical activity education and training for trainees and existing healthcare professionals workforce would help embed physical activity into routine clinical practice.Brief advice intervention training during every consultation, such as providing relevant individualised information and signposting, can be impactful.Physical activity within a broader cancer rehabilitation programme should be integrated as standard for every cancer patient.Individualised plans may include prehabilitation, restorative rehabilitation and palliative rehabilitation.Patient preferences and the patient experience should continue to shape service design.There is a need to ensure physical activity advice is consistent throughout healthcare settings and not fragmented between primary, secondary and tertiary care.",0
Patients values regarding primary health care: a systematic review of qualitative and quantitative evidence.,"BACKGROUND: Accessible and high-quality primary health care (PHC) is fundamental to countries moving towards universal health coverage. In order to improve the quality of patient-centered care provided in PHC, a comprehensive understanding of patients' values is crucial to address any gaps in the health care system. This systematic review aimed to identify patients' values relevant to PHC. METHODS: We searched primary qualitative and quantitative studies about patients' values related to primary care in PubMed and EMBASE (Ovid) from 2009 to 2020. The studies' quality was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for both quantitative and qualitative studies and Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Studies (COREQ) for qualitative studies. A thematic approach was used in the data synthesis. OUTCOME: The database search resulted in 1,817 articles. A total of 68 articles were full-text screened. Data were extracted from nine quantitative and nine qualitative studies that met the inclusion criteria. The participants of the studies were mainly the general population in high-income countries. Four themes emerged from the analysis: patients' values related to privacy and autonomy; values associated with the general practitioners including virtuous characteristics, knowledge and competence; values involving patient-doctor interactions such as shared decision-making and empowerment; and core values related to the primary care system such as continuity, referral, and accessibility. CONCLUSIONS: This review reveals that the doctor's personal characteristics and their interactions with the patients are critical considerations concerning the primary care services from the patients' point of view. The inclusion of these values is essential to improve the quality of primary care.",0
Assessing Stakeholder Engagement for Outcomes-Based Research Among Patients With Chronic Rhinosinusitis and Asthma: A Survey-Based Investigation.,"BACKGROUND: Despite significant morbidity, there remains a critical need for prospective analyses to investigate the impact of comorbid chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with asthma (CRSwA) on patient centered outcomes. The objective of this study was to ascertain critical stakeholder feedback from patients that could inform future study design based on patient preferences, in an effort to optimize patient enrollment. METHODS: A prospective, descriptive study was performed in order to determine the importance of various factors on CRSwA treatment among critical stakeholders. A Likert-scale survey highlighting various aspects of treatment of CRSwA and elucidating patient enthusiasm for clinical enrollment was constructed and prospectively administered to patients with CRSwA. A univariate analysis was instituted to understand the significance of the different trial design preferences. RESULTS: Survey responses were collected from a total of 17 patients with CRSwA. With Likert scores >4/5, responses indicated significant stakeholder interest in research focused on understanding symptom triggers, including the impact of air quality and allergens. Importantly, the highest mean scores noted were for studies focused on improving (1) overall quality of life (4.8/5) and (2) lung function (4.8/5). Patients appeared least interested in participation in a randomized trial, whereas the greatest support was communicated for a purely observational trial (P = .08). CONCLUSION: Patients with CRSwA demonstrate enthusiasm for participation in research that focuses on improving patient centered outcomes-specifically quality of life and lung function. Stakeholder feedback also indicates a preference for observational study design over randomized control trials.",0
Patients' acceptance of a shared cancer follow-up model of care between general practitioners and radiation oncologists: A population-based survey using the theoretical Framework of Acceptability.,"INTRODUCTION: International and national guidelines highlight the need for general practitioner involvement during and after active cancer treatment and throughout long-term follow-up care. This paper aimed to evaluate patients' acceptance of radiation oncology shared follow-up care using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA). METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at two cancer care centres in the Illawarra Shoalhaven region of Australia. A sample of patients scheduled for a radiation oncology follow-up consultation in 2021 were sent a 32-point self-complete paper-based survey. Data were analysed using descriptive, parametric and non-parametric statistical analysis. This paper followed the Checklist for Reporting of Survey Studies (CROSS). RESULTS: Of the 414 surveys returned (45% response rate), the acceptance for radiation oncology shared cancer follow-up care was high (80%). Patients treated with only radiotherapy were 1.7 times more likely to accept shared follow-up care than those treated with multiple modalities. Patients who preferred follow-up care for fewer than three years were 7.5 times more likely to accept shared care than those who preferred follow-up care for five years. Patients who travelled more than 20 minutes to their radiation oncologist or to the rural cancer centre were slightly more likely to accept shared care than those who travelled less than twenty minutes to the regional cancer centre. A high understanding of shared care (Intervention Coherence) and a positive feeling towards shared care (Affective Attitude) were significant predictive factors in accepting shared radiation oncology follow-up care. CONCLUSION: Health services need to ensure patient preferences are considered to provide patient-centred cancer follow-up care. Shared cancer follow-up care implementation should start with patients who prefer a shorter follow-up period and understand the benefits of shared care. However, patients' involvement needs to be considered alongside other clinical risk profiles and organisational factors. Future qualitative research using the TFA constructs is warranted to inform clinical practice change.",0
Choosing Systemic Agents for Psoriasis.,"Treatment options for moderate-to-severe psoriasis depend on drug efficacy and safety, patient preferences, comorbidities, and cost-no drug dominates across all dimensions. Interleukin (IL)-17 inhibitors may be preferred for fast-acting treatment, while the 3-month schedule of risankizumab, ustekinumab, or tildrakizumab may be attractive for patients who prioritize fewer injections. Phototherapy is suitable for patients who wish to avoid systemic agents or when cost is a concern. For patients with poor adherence, infliximab or tildrakizumab may be well suited as they require in-office administration. Dermatologists can educate patients on available therapies to find a regimen best suited to their needs.",0
Patient Preferences and Perceptions of Provider Diversity in Orthopaedic Surgery.,"BACKGROUND: Orthopaedic surgery in the U.S. historically has been among the least demographically diverse specialties in medicine. Currently, limited data exist on how patients perceive diversity within the field and what patients look for when choosing an orthopaedic surgeon. The purpose of this study was to identify specific patient preferences for surgeon demographics and understand patient perceptions of racial and gender diversity in orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: Nonconsecutive patients from orthopaedic clinics affiliated with a U.S. academic health system voluntarily completed a 39-item questionnaire that surveyed basic demographic information, perception of diversity, racial and gender preferences during surgeon selection, and perception of health-care inequalities. Bivariate analyses were used to test the association between patient-surgeon demographic variables and ratings of diversity. Multiple regression models were used to identify independent predictors of overall perceived diversity ratings. RESULTS: A total of 349 patients (80.6% White, 17.9% Black, and 1.5% other) were analyzed. Black patients were more likely to experience difficulty relating to their surgeon than White patients (11.48% versus 2.29%; odds ratio [OR], 5.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.55 to 21.1; p = 0.004). Moreover, Black patients were more likely to perceive racial bias from their surgeon than White patients (5.17% versus 0.37%; OR, 14.44; 95% CI, 1.14 to 766.29; p = 0.02). While the level of racial diversity perceived by White patients (2.57 of 10) was significantly higher than that perceived by Black patients (2.10 of 10) (p = 0.001), the absolute difference between these 2 figures was small, suggesting that both groups perceived racial diversity in orthopaedics to be low. White and Black patients differed in their importance ranking of a surgeon's race (p < 0.0001): Black patients ranked a surgeon's race with higher importance (mean, 3.49 of 10) when selecting a surgeon compared with White patients (1.45 of 10). Both male and female patients gave relatively low importance rankings for a surgeon's gender (mean, 1.58 of 10 and 2.15 of 10, respectively, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients in this study did not perceive orthopaedic surgery as a diverse field (overall diversity rating, <3 of 10). There were significant racial and gender differences in patients' preferences for specific physician characteristics when choosing an orthopaedic surgeon, which may help explain some instances of perceived racial bias and difficulty relating to their orthopaedic surgeon.",0
Management reasoning and patient-clinician interactions: Insights from shared decision-making and simulated outpatient encounters.,"PURPOSE: To expand understanding of patient-clinician interactions in management reasoning. METHODS: We reviewed 10 videos of simulated patient-clinician encounters to identify instances of problematic and successful communication, then reviewed the videos again through the lens of two models of shared decision-making (SDM): an 'involvement-focused' model and a 'problem-focused' model. Using constant comparative qualitative analysis we explored the connections between these patient-clinician interactions and management reasoning. RESULTS: Problems in patient-clinician interactions included failures to: encourage patient autonomy; invite the patient's involvement in decision-making; convey the health impact of the problem; explore and address concerns and questions; explore the context of decision-making (including patient preferences); meet the patient where they are; integrate situational preferences and priorities; offer >1 viable option; work with the patient to solve a problem of mutual concern; explicitly agree to a final care plan; and build the patient-clinician relationship. Clinicians' 'management scripts' varied along a continuum of prioritizing clinician vs patient needs. Patients also have their own cognitive scripts that guide their interactions with clinicians. The involvement-focused and problem-focused SDM models illuminated distinct, complementary issues. CONCLUSIONS: Management reasoning is a deliberative interaction occurring in the space between individuals. Juxtaposing management reasoning alongside SDM generated numerous insights.",0
Intra-gastric balloon with lifestyle modification: a promising therapeutic option for overweight and obese patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"BACKGROUND: Data on effects of intra-gastric balloon (IGB) on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) are scarce, in part with contradictory results, and mainly obtained in tertiary care patients with diabetes and other comorbidities. We here explore effects of IGB in patients with MASLD referred to a first-line obesity clinic. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, patients with at least significant fibrosis (≥ F2) and/or severe steatosis (S3) according to screening transient elastography (FibroScan®) were offered a second FibroScan® after 6 months lifestyle modification with or without IGB (based on patient preference). RESULTS: 50 of 100 consecutively screened patients (generally non-diabetic) qualified for repeated evaluation and 29 (58%) of those had a second FibroScan®. At baseline, at least significant fibrosis was present in 28% and severe steatosis in 91%. IGB was placed in 19 patients (59%), whereas 10 patients (41%) preferred only lifestyle modification (no differences in baseline characteristics between both groups). After 6 months, liver stiffness decreased markedly in the IGB group (median: from 6.0 to 4.9 kPa, p = 0.005), but not in the lifestyle modification only group (median: from 5.5 to 6.9 kPa, p = 0.477). Steatosis improved in both groups, (controlled attenuation parameter values; IGB, mean ± SD: from 328 ± 34 to 272 ± 62 dB/m, p = 0.006: lifestyle modification only, mean ± SD: from 344 ± 33 to 305 ± 43 dB/m: p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Both steatosis and fibrosis improve markedly in overweight/obese patients with MASLD after 6 months IGB combined with lifestyle modification. Our results warrant further research into long-term effect of IGB in these patients.",0
"Prevalence of Hemorrhoids and Their Risk Factors Among the Adult Population in Jazan, Saudi Arabia.","BACKGROUND: Hemorrhoids are defined as the symptomatic enlargement and distal displacement of the normal anal cushions. They can be either internal, external, or internoexternal, according to their position in relation to the dentate line. They can cause significant financial burdens and personal discomfort. However, the typical symptoms of hemorrhoids include bleeding, pain, skin irritation, fecal leakage, prolapse, mucus secretion, and developing a thrombosed hernia. Nonetheless, research has shown that individuals with and without hemorrhoids equally report these symptoms. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of hemorrhoids and their risk factors among adult subjects in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This investigation was a cross-sectional study targeting adults diagnosed with hemorrhoids in the Jazan region. Data collection was performed via a self-administered questionnaire to measure sociodemographic data of the participants, lifestyle factors associated with hemorrhoids, clinical presentations of the disease, and Rome IV criteria for diagnosis of functional constipation. The chi-squared test was used to assess the frequency of hemorrhoid symptoms according to the participants' sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. RESULTS: In the current study, which recruited 361 participants, 59% (216 individuals) reported experiencing at least one symptom of hemorrhoids. The majority of the sample were females (60%), Saudis (96%), and living in urban areas (59%) and had a university education (77.3%). The most common risk factors identified were lack of regular physical activity (83%), prolonged sitting during office work (51%), and consuming food with saturated fat (50%). A total of 44% (159 participants) had a family history of hemorrhoids, and 40% reported suffering from constipation three times or more per week. Only 34% (123 participants) had been diagnosed with hemorrhoids by a physician. Interestingly, the majority of participants (57%) preferred using home remedies instead of seeking medical care from a healthcare professional. When assessing factors associated with experiencing a minimum of six hemorrhoid symptoms per month, age, lifestyle factors, family history of hemorrhoids, and defecation practices were found to be significantly correlated with a higher occurrence of symptoms (with a p-value of less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: The current study identified a high prevalence of hemorrhoid symptoms and their risk factors among the adult population in the Jazan region of Saudi Arabia. The findings suggest a need to increase the awareness of the public about hemorrhoids risk factors and the importance of seeking healthcare at an early stage of the disease.",0
"Assessing Medical Ethics Knowledge and Practice Among Healthcare Professionals in Al Majma'ah, Saudi Arabia.","Background The healthcare system is increasingly confronted with ethical challenges, necessitating a thorough exploration of healthcare providers' ethical knowledge and attitudes. This study aims to evaluate the ethical awareness and attitudes of healthcare providers in the Al Majma'ah region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Aim This research focuses on assessing the level of knowledge and practice regarding medical ethics among healthcare providers in a community hospital in Majmaah, KSA. Methods A comprehensive cross-sectional study was undertaken in the Majmaah governorate of Saudi Arabia. Data collection involved distributing a meticulously designed questionnaire to healthcare providers and faculty members affiliated with the College of Medicine. Subsequently, the acquired dataset underwent analysis utilizing SPSS software. Results A total of 183 participants were included in the study. The findings revealed that only 77 respondents (42.1%) considered ethical issues in their profession as extremely important. Moreover, 104 participants (56.8%) were aware of the existence of an ethics committee in their institution. A total of 113 respondents (61.7%) disagreed with the notion that ethical conduct is primarily important to avoid legal consequences, and 120 participants (65.6%) believed in the significance of in-service training on medical ethics for doctors. The study also highlighted that 100 participants (54.6%) believed that healthcare providers' opinions supersede patient preferences. However, a majority, 163 participants (89.1%), agreed that patients should be informed of any wrongdoing, contrasting with only 20 (10.9%) who disagreed. When asked about adhering to patients' wishes despite doctors' opinions, 112 (61.2%) responded affirmatively, while 71 (38.3%) disagreed. There was also a disparity in opinions regarding the necessity of obtaining consent, with 81 (44.3%) agreeing that consent is required not only for surgical procedures but also for medications or investigations. Furthermore, 137 participants (74.9%) recognized the importance of discussing ethical, social, and legal issues during clinical rounds alongside clinical aspects of patient care, while 46 (25.1%) disagreed. Conclusion Although medical ethics were introduced into the Saudi healthcare system more than a decade ago, this study underscores the ethical necessity of obtaining comprehensive informed consent prior to invasive and other medical procedures. It also highlights the significance of engaging patients in the decision-making process regarding their treatment. Well-informed patients typically exhibit higher satisfaction levels and are less inclined to pursue legal action.",0
"Effectiveness of telehealth-based exercise interventions on pain, physical function and quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis: A meta-analysis.","OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of telehealth-based exercise intervention on pain, physical function and quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Six databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PEDro and Web of Science Core Collection) were searched for relevant randomised controlled trials published from database inception to 3 June 2021. Reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted data and used the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool for quality assessment. A meta-analysis and subgroup analyses, stratified by control condition, intervention duration and delivery type, were conducted by Revman 5.4. The study was reported in compliance with PRISMA statement. RESULTS: A total of 9 independent RCTs with 861 participants were included. The meta-analysis showed that the telehealth-based exercise interventions significantly reduced pain in KOA patients (SMD = -0.28, 95% CI [-0.49, -0.08], p < .01) and produced similar effects to controls in terms of physical function and quality of life. Subgroup analysis revealed that telehealth-based exercise interventions were superior to the use of exercise booklet and usual care in terms of pain and physical function and were similar to face-to-face exercise treatment; a long-term (>3 months) intervention and the use of web and smartphone APPs to deliver exercise interventions were associated with better pain relief and physical function. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth-based exercise intervention is an effective strategy for KOA management during the COVID-19 epidemic, and it is significantly better than usual care in reducing knee pain and improving physical function and was able to achieve the effects of traditional face-to-face exercise treatment. Although the duration and type of delivery associated with the effect of the intervention have been identified, patient preference and acceptability need to be considered in practice.",0
Preference of acromegaly patients for treatment attributes in Spain.,"OBJECTIVE: Acromegaly is a rare disease caused by increased growth hormone secretion and a subsequent increase in insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels. Patients display multiple comorbidities that affect their quality of life (QoL). Treatment aims to maintain good biochemical control, tumour control and reduce the risk of comorbidities; however, their impact on QoL has been overlooked until recently. We interviewed patients to explore their preferences with regard to treatment attributes. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study based on interviews and a discrete choice experiment (DCE) in a Spanish cohort. METHODS: Adult patients diagnosed with acromegaly ≥1 year before the start of the study and under treatment were included. Treatment attributes were collected from patient testimony during face-to-face interviews. Then, a DCE was performed to elicit patient preferences for certain treatment attributes. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients completed the study. QoL improvement was the most important treatment attribute (37%), followed by IGF-I control (20%), blood sugar control (17%) and tumour control (13%). Secondary attributes were pain associated with the route of administration (7%), diarrhoea (2%), administration method (2%) and storage conditions (2%). We then calculated the theoretical share of preference for existing treatments, based on the individual preference utility for each attribute and level. Pegvisomant obtained the highest share of preference overall, and the highest preference as a second-line treatment (53 and 95%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: QoL greatly influences patient treatment preference. Since acromegaly patients are informed and aware of their disease, treatment choices should always be shared with patients.",1
Quantifying Benefit-Risk Trade-Offs Toward Prophylactic Treatment Among Adult Patients With Hemophilia A in China: Discrete Choice Experiment Study.,"BACKGROUND: Hemophilia A is a chronic condition that requires meticulous treatment and management. Patient preferences for prophylactic treatment can substantially influence adherence, outcomes, and quality of life, yet these preferences remain underexplored, particularly in China. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the preferences for prophylactic treatment among Chinese adult patients with hemophilia A without inhibitors, considering clinical effectiveness, side effects, dosing mode, and dosing frequency. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was used to elicit patient preferences for prophylactic treatment of hemophilia. The study was conducted across 7 provinces in China with socioeconomic and geographical diversity. Subgroup analysis was performed according to education level, geographic location, and treatment type, alongside the exploration of benefit-risk trade-offs. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients completed the discrete choice experiment questionnaire, and we included 102 responses for analysis based on predetermined exclusion criteria. The study found that patients prioritized reducing annual bleeding times and avoiding the risk of developing inhibitors over treatment process attributes. Subgroup analysis revealed that lower-educated patients and those from rural areas attached more importance to the dosing mode, likely due to barriers to self-administration. Patients demonstrated a clear understanding of benefit-risk trade-offs, exhibiting a willingness to accept an increased risk of developing inhibitors for improved clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides valuable insights into the preferences of patients with hemophilia A for prophylactic treatment in China. Understanding these preferences can enhance shared decision-making between patients and clinicians, fostering personalized prophylactic treatment plans that may optimize adherence and improve clinical outcomes.",1
Virtual multidisciplinary pain treatment: Experiences and feedback from children with chronic pain and their caregivers.,"BACKGROUND: The onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) necessitated a rapid transition to virtual care for chronic pain treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study examined experiences of patients and caregivers who received virtual multidisciplinary pain treatment (MDT) for pediatric chronic pain between March 2020 and August 2021. METHODS: A mixed methods design was implemented using qualitative interviews and quantitative satisfaction surveys. Satisfaction surveys were administered to a convenience sample of patients (aged 8 to 18; N = 20) and their caregivers (N = 20) who received MDT through an outpatient hospital pediatric chronic pain program. Interviews were conducted with a subset of these patients and their caregivers (n = 6). RESULTS: Analysis of interviews revealed four themes: 1) benefits of virtual care; 2) challenges of virtual care; 3) recommendations and evaluation of virtual care; and 4) patient preferences. Analysis of the satisfaction survey data revealed that while patients and caregivers were satisfied with many aspects of virtual care, 65% (n = 13) of patients reported a preference for in-person appointments, with caregivers showing equal preference for in-person and virtual appointments, though this was a non-significant difference (p = .37). Overall, both patients and caregivers stated a stronger preference for in-person physiotherapy sessions but were willing to have psychology sessions provided virtually. Finally, the most reported preference was for a hybrid model of care incorporating at least some in-person contact with providers. CONCLUSION: This study provides a rich exploration of virtual care for multidisciplinary pediatric chronic pain treatment. The current results may inform the future development of guidelines for virtual care delivery with pediatric chronic pain populations.",0
Surgical service and distance traveled drive patient preference for Care Hotel: a retrospective cohort study.,"Mayo Clinic's Care Hotel is a virtual hybrid care model which allows postoperative patients to recover in a comfortable environment after a low-risk procedure. Hospitals need to understand the key patient factors that promote acceptance of the Care Hotel if they are to benefit from this innovative care model. This study aims to identify factors that can predict whether a patient will stay at Care Hotel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective chart review of 1065 patients was conducted between 23 July 2020, and 31 December 2021. Variables examined included patient age, sex, race, ethnicity, Charlson comorbidity index, distance patient travelled to hospital, length of surgery, day of the week of surgery, and surgical service. Associations of patient and surgery characteristics with the primary outcome of staying at the Care Hotel were assessed using unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: Of the 1065 patients who met criteria for admission to the Care Hotel during the study period, 717 (67.3%) chose to stay at the Care Hotel while 328 (32.7%) choose to be admitted to the hospital. In multivariable analysis, there was a significant association between surgical service and staying at the Care Hotel (P<0.001). Specifically, there was a higher likelihood of staying at the Care Hotel for patients from Neurosurgery [odds rato (OR)=1.86, P=0.004], Otorhinolaryngology (OR=2.70, P<0.001), and General Surgery (OR=2.75, P=0.002). Additionally, there was a higher likelihood of staying at the Care Hotel with distance travelled over 110 miles [OR (per each doubling)=1.10, P=0.007]. CONCLUSION: When developing a post-surgical care model for patients following outpatient procedures, the referring surgical service is a primary factor to consider in order to ensure patient acceptance, along with patient distance. This study can assist other healthcare organizations considering this model, as it provides guidance on which factors are most indicative of acceptance.",0
"Patients' Satisfaction with Obstetrics-Gynecology, and Pediatric Healthcare Services in Vietnam: A Multicentre Cross-Sectional Study.","PURPOSE: Despite improvements in maternal and child health in Vietnam, sustained efforts are required to improve healthcare quality and resolve persistent disparities, highlighting the universal significance of customer satisfaction in healthcare. This study aims to assess patient satisfaction with healthcare services and associated factors at obstetrics-gynecology and pediatric hospitals across different geographical areas in Vietnam. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2019 among 647 patients or caregivers of hospitalized children at three major obstetrics-gynecology and pediatric hospitals, representing different geographical areas in Northern Vietnam. A Ministry of Health-approved satisfaction instrument was utilized to assess patient satisfaction. The instrument included 31 items measuring five dimensions of perceived satisfaction. Exploratory factor analysis examined the construct validity of the satisfaction measurement, and multivariate linear regression determined the factors associated with patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Among the 643 participants, 520 were female (89.87%), and nearly half were aged 18-29 years old (43.7%). Factor analysis revealed three dimensions: ""Competency and Outcomes"", ""Accessibility and Procedures"", and ""Facilities and Equipment"", with mean domain scores of 4.6 ± 0.43, 4.28 ± 0.67, and 4.53 ± 0.51, respectively. The proportion of participants completely satisfied with overall service quality was 48.52%, and expectation met was 34.53%. Multivariate linear regression indicated that patients from hospitals in the Red River Delta region had higher satisfaction scores than those in the Middle region across all domains (p<0.05). Higher health insurance coverage was associated with increased satisfaction, while education level, economic status, and ethnicity also influenced satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The study revealed moderate to high levels of satisfaction among patients at three major obstetrics-gynecology and pediatric hospitals in northern Vietnam. The findings may provide useful evidence for implementing hospital quality control in Vietnam, focusing on patient-centered goals.",0
Shared decision making in patients with kidney failure.,"'Elderly' is most commonly defined as an individual aged 65 years or older. However, this definition fails to account for the differences in genetics, lifestyle and overall health that contribute to significant heterogeneity among the elderly beyond chronological age. As the world population continues to age, the prevalence of chronic diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), is increasing and CKD frequently progresses to kidney failure. Moreover, frailty represents a multidimensional clinical entity highly prevalent in this population, which needs to be adequately assessed to inform and support medical decisions. Selecting the optimal treatment pathway for the elderly and frail kidney failure population, be it hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or conservative kidney management is complex, because of the presence of comorbidities associated with low survival rates and impaired quality of life. Management of these patients should involve a multidisciplinary approach including doctors from various specialties, nurses, psychologists, dieticians, and physiotherapists. Studies are mostly retrospective and observational, lacking adjustment for confounders or address selection and indication biases, making it difficult to use these data to guide treatment decisions. Throughout this review we discuss the difficulty of making a one-size-fits-all recommendation for the clinical needs of older patients with kidney failure. We advocate that a research agenda for optimization of the critical issues we present in this review be implemented. We recommend prospective studies that address these issues, and systematic reviews incorporating the complementary evidence of both observational and interventional studies. Furthermore, we strongly support a shared decision making process matching evidence with patient preferences to ensure that individualized choices are made regarding dialysis vs. conservative kidney management, dialysis modality, and optimal vascular access.",0
Who Benefits From Hip Arthroplasty or Knee Arthroplasty? Preoperative Patient-reported Outcome Thresholds Predict Meaningful Improvement.,"BACKGROUND: Hip arthroplasty (HA) and knee arthroplasty (KA) are high-volume procedures. However, there is a debate about the quality of indication; that is, whether surgery is truly indicated in all patients. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) may be used to determine preoperative thresholds to differentiate patients who will likely benefit from surgery from those who will not. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What were the minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) for three commonly used PROMs in a large population of patients undergoing HA or KA treated in a general orthopaedic practice? (2) Do patients who reach the MCID differ in important ways from those who do not? (3) What preoperative PROM score thresholds best distinguish patients who achieve a meaningful improvement 12 months postsurgery from those who do not? (4) Do patients with preoperative PROM scores below thresholds still experience gains after surgery? METHODS: Between October 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020, 4182 patients undergoing HA and 3645 patients undergoing KA agreed to be part of the PROMoting Quality study and were hence included by study nurses in one of nine participating German hospitals. From a selected group of 1843 patients with HA and 1546 with KA, we derived MCIDs using the anchor-based change difference method to determine meaningful improvements. Second, we estimated which preoperative PROM score thresholds best distinguish patients who achieve an MCID from those who do not, using the preoperative PROM scores that maximized the Youden index. PROMs were Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function short form (HOOS-PS) (scored 0 to 100 points; lower indicates better health), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score-Physical Function short form (KOOS-PS) (scored 0 to 100 points; lower indicates better health), EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) (scored -0.661 to 1 points; higher indicates better health), and a 10-point VAS for pain (perceived pain in the joint under consideration for surgery within the past 7 days) (scored 0 to 10 points; lower indicates better health). The performance of derived thresholds is reported using the Youden index, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, geometric mean as a measure of central tendency, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: MCIDs for the EQ-5D-5L were 0.2 for HA and 0.2 for KA, with a maximum of 1 point, where higher values represented better health-related quality of life. For the pain scale, they were -0.9 for HA and -0.7 for KA, of 10 points (maximum), where lower scores represent lower pain. For the HOOS-PS, the MCID was -10, and for the KOOS-PS it was -5 of 100 points, where lower scores represent better functioning. Patients who reached the MCID differed from patients who did not reach the MCID with respect to baseline PROM scores across the evaluated PROMs and for both HA and KA. Patients who reached an MCID versus those who did not also differed regarding other aspects including education and comorbidities, but this was not consistent across PROMs and arthroplasty type. Preoperative PROM score thresholds for HA were 0.7 for EQ-5D-5L (Youden index: 0.55), 42 for HOOS-PS (Youden index: 0.27), and 3.5 for the pain scale (Youden index: 0.47). For KA, the thresholds were 0.6 for EQ-5D-5L (Youden index: 0.57), 39 for KOOS-PS (Youden index: 0.25), and 6.5 for the pain scale (Youden index: 0.40). A higher Youden index for EQ-5D-5L than for the other PROMs indicates that the thresholds for EQ-5D-5L were better for distinguishing patients who reached a meaningful improvement from those who did not. Patients who did not reach the thresholds could still achieve MCIDs, especially for functionality and the pain scale. CONCLUSION: We found that patients who experienced meaningful improvements (MCIDs) mainly differed from those who did not regarding their preoperative PROM scores. We further identified that patients undergoing HA or KA with a score above 0.7 or 0.6, respectively, on the EQ-5D-5L, below 42 or 39 on the HOOS-PS or KOOS-PS, or below 3.5 or 6.5 on a 10-point joint-specific pain scale presurgery had no meaningful benefit from surgery. The thresholds can support clinical decision-making. For example, when thresholds indicate that a meaningful improvement is not likely to be achieved after surgery, other treatment options may be prioritized. Although the thresholds can be used as support, patient preferences and medical expertise must supplement the decision. Future studies might evaluate the utility of using these thresholds in practice, examine how different thresholds can be combined as a multidimensional decision tool, and derive presurgery thresholds based on additional PROMs used in practice. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Preoperative PROM score thresholds in this study will support clinicians in decision-making through objective measures that can improve the quality of the recommendation for surgery.",0
Efficiency and Impact of Hypnoanalgesia for Cardiac Catheterisation in Paediatric Population.,"Hypnoanalgesia is a promising non-pharmacologic adjunct technique in paediatric interventions. Its safety, efficiency, and impacts on paediatric cardiac catheterisation (CC) are unknown. METHODS: In a prospective study, patients aged <16 years who underwent CC under hypnoanalgesia from January to December 2021 were included. Pain and anxiety were assessed using the analgesia nociception index (ANI) and the visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: Sixteen patients were included; the mean age was 10.5 years, and the mean weight was 37 kg. Catheterisations were interventional in 10 patients (62.5%). Hypnoanalgesia indications were general anaesthesia (GA) contraindication in four patients (25.0%), the need for accurate pressure measurements in three patients (18.7%), and interventionist/patient preferences in nine (56.3%). CC was accomplished in 15 patients (93.7%), even in complicated cases. In one case, pulmonary artery pressures were normalised compared to previous catheterisation under local anaesthesia alone. The VAS score was under 5/10 for all patients. The ANI remained above 50 (no painful zone) for all but one patient. There was no significant decrease in the ANI during the intervention compared to the baseline (p = 0.62). No complications were reported. CONCLUSION: Paediatric CC is feasible and safe under hypnoanalgesia, even in complicated cases. Hypnoanalgesia was efficient in managing pain and stress, and it ensures more reliable pressure measurements.",0
"Proportion of medical admissions that may be hospitalised at home and their service utilisation patterns: a single-centre, descriptive retrospective cohort study in Singapore.","OBJECTIVES: For eligible patient groups, hospital-at-home (HaH) programmes have been shown to deliver equivalent patient outcomes with cost reduction compared with standard care. This study aims to establish a benchmark of inpatient admissions that could potentially be substituted by HaH services. DESIGN: Descriptive retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Academic tertiary hospital in Singapore. PARTICIPANTS: 124 253 medical admissions over 20 months (January 2016 to August 2017). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure was the proportion of hospitalised patients who may be eligible for HaH, based on eligibility criteria adapted for the Singapore context. The secondary measures were the utilisation patterns and outcomes of these patients. RESULTS: Applying generalised eligibility criteria to the retrospective dataset showed that 53.0% of 124 253 medical admissions fitted the eligibility criteria for HaH based on administrative data. 46.8% of such patients had a length of stay <48 hours ('short-stay') and 53.1% had a length of stay ≥48 hours ('medium-stay'). The mortality rate and the 30-day readmission rate were lower in the 'short-stay' cohort (0.6%, 12.8%) compared with the 'medium-stay' cohort (0.7%, 20.3%). The key services used by both groups were: parenteral drug administration, blood investigations, imaging procedures and consultations with allied health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Up to 53.0% of medical admissions receive care elements that HaH programmes could provide. Applying estimates of functional limitations and patient preferences, we propose a target of ~18% of inpatient medical admissions to be substituted by HaH services. The methodology adopted in this paper is a reproducible approach to characterise potential patients and service utilisation requirements when developing such programmes.",0
Active surveillance should be considered for select men with Grade Group 2 prostate cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Treatment decisions for localized prostate cancer must balance patient preferences, oncologic risk, and preservation of sexual, urinary and bowel function. While Active Surveillance (AS) is the recommended option for men with Grade Group 1 (Gleason Score 3 + 3 = 6) prostate cancer without other intermediate-risk features, men with Grade Group 2 (Gleason Score 3 + 4 = 7) are typically recommended active treatment. For select patients, AS can be a possible initial management strategy for men with Grade Group 2. Herein, we review current urology guidelines and the urologic literature regarding recommendations and evidence for AS for this patient group. MAIN BODY: AS benefits men with prostate cancer by maintaining their current quality of life and avoiding treatment side effects. AS protocols with close follow up always allow for an option to change course and pursue curative treatment. All the major guideline organizations now include Grade Group 2 disease with slightly differing definitions of eligibility based on risk using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, clinical stage, and other factors. Selected men with Grade Group 2 on AS have similar rates of deferred treatment and metastasis to men with Grade Group 1 on AS. There is a growing body of evidence from randomized controlled trials, large observational (prospective and retrospective) cohorts that confirm the oncologic safety of AS for these men. While some men will inevitably conclude AS at some point due to clinical reclassification with biopsy or imaging, some men may be able to stay on AS until transition to watchful waiting (WW). Magnetic resonance imaging is an important tool to confirm AS eligibility, to monitor progression and guide prostate biopsy. CONCLUSION: AS is a viable initial management option for well-informed and select men with Grade Group 2 prostate cancer, low volume of pattern 4, and no other adverse clinicopathologic findings following a well-defined monitoring protocol. In the modern era of AS, urologists have tools at their disposal to better stage patients at initial diagnosis, risk stratify patients, and gain information on the biologic potential of a patient's prostate cancer.",0
"Surveillance Imaging Strategies for Pituitary Adenomas: When, How Frequent, and When to Stop.","OBJECTIVE: To describe a practical approach of when and how often to perform imaging, and when to stop imaging pituitary adenomas (PAs). METHODS: A literature review was carried out and recommendations provided are derived largely from personal experience. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging is the mainstay imaging modality of choice in the assessment, treatment planning, and follow-up of PAs. These adenomas are discovered incidentally during imaging for a variety of unrelated conditions, because of clinical symptoms related to mass effects on the adjacent structures, or during workup for functional alterations of the adenoma. Imaging is also used in the preoperative and postoperative phases of assessment of PAs, for surgical and radiotherapy planning, for postoperative surveillance to assess for adenoma stability and detection of adenoma recurrence, and for surveillance to monitor for adenoma growth in unoperated PAs. Currently, because there are no evidence-based consensus recommendations, the optimal strategy for surveillance imaging of PAs is not clearly established. Younger age, initial adenoma size, extrasellar extension, mass effect, cavernous sinus invasion, functional status, histopathologic characteristics, cost considerations, imaging accessibility, patient preference, and patient contraindications (eg, implanted metallic devices and patient claustrophobia) are all important factors that influence the strategy for surveillance imaging. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a practical approach of performing surveillance imaging strategies for PAs that should be individualized based on clinical presentation, history, adenoma morphology on imaging, and histopathologic characteristics.",0
Understanding Treatment Preferences Among People Living with HIV in Australia: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"PURPOSE: To better understand what is most important to people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWH) when choosing their treatment. We assessed how PLWH trade off the potential risks and benefits of oral and long acting injectable (LAI) treatments. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Firstly, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 PLWH to develop a holistic understanding of experiences and determine attributes that contribute to treatment decision-making. Secondly, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) was used to understand the treatment preferences for PLWH with n = 99 PLWH aged 18 years or over with a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and who were currently using anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Study participants were presented with 12 scenarios and asked to select their preferred treatment among two hypothetical injectable treatment alternatives, ""injection 1"" and ""injection 2"" and their current oral ART treatment. The DCE data were modelled using a latent class model (LCM). RESULTS: The model revealed significant heterogeneity in preferences for treatment attributes among study participants. Two segments/classes of PLWH were identified. The first segment expressed a strong preference for their current oral treatment; the second segment showed strong preference for the injection treatment and for it to be administered in a GP clinic. Overall, out-of-pocket cost was the most important attribute for participants. One-third of PLWH were willing to switch to an LAI. CONCLUSION: Not all PLWH valued the same treatment attributes equally. Overall, out-of-pocket costs for treatments were considered by respondents as the most determining factor in making treatment choices. Results have important implications for healthcare policy and will serve to better inform patients and stakeholders involved in the treatment decision-making process about the treatment preferences of PLWH. Clinicians are encouraged to consider shared decision-making to establish the treatment course that best aligns with PLWH's treatment goals.",1
Establishment of Prospective Registry of Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: The Korean Urological Oncology Society Database.,"PURPOSE: To establish a prospective registry for the active surveillance (AS) of prostate cancer (PC) using the Korean Urological Oncology Society (KUOS) database and to present interim analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The KUOS registry of AS for PC (KUOS-AS-PC) was organized in May 2019 and comprises multiple institutions nationwide. The eligibility criteria were as follows: patients with (1) pathologically proven PC; (2) pre-biopsy prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤20 ng/mL; (3) International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 1 or 2 (no cribriform pattern 4); (4) clinical T stage ≤T2c; (5) positive core ratio ≤50%; and (6) maximal cancer involvement in the core ≤50%. Detailed longitudinal clinical information, including multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging and disease-specific outcomes, was recorded. RESULTS: From May 2019 to June 2021, 296 patients were enrolled, and 284 were analyzed. The mean±standard deviation (SD) age at enrollment was 68.7±8.2 years. The median follow-up period was 11.2 months (5.9-16.8 mo). Majority of patients had pre-biopsy PSA ≤10 ng/mL (91.2%), PSA density <0.2 ng/mL² (79.7%), ISUP grade group 1 (94.4%), single positive core (65.7%), maximal cancer involvement in the core ≤20% (78.1%), and clinical T stage of T1c or lower (72.9%). Fifty-two (18.3%) discontinued AS for various reasons. Interventions included radical prostatectomy (80.8%), transurethral prostatectomy (5.8%), primary androgen deprivation therapy (5.8%), radiation (5.8%), and focal therapy (1.9%). The mean±SD time to intervention was 8.9±5.2 months. The reasons for discontinuation included pathologic reclassification (59.6%), patient preference (25.0%), and radiologic reclassification (9.6%). Two (4.8%) patients with pathologic Gleason score upgraded to ISUP grade group 4, no biochemical recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The KUOS established a successful prospective database of PC patients undergoing AS in Korea, named the KUOS-AS-PC registry.",0
Patient preferences and willingness-to-pay for community pharmacy-led Medicare Part D consultation services: A discrete choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Community pharmacies currently offer Medicare Part D consultation services, often at no-cost. Despite facilitating plan-switching behavior, identifying potential cost-savings, and increasing medication adherence, patient uptake of these services remains low. OBJECTIVES: To investigate patient preferences for specific service-offering attributes and marginal willingness-to-pay (mWTP) for an enhanced community pharmacy Medicare Part D consultation service. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) guided by the SERVQUAL framework was developed and administered using a national online survey panel. Study participants were English-speaking adults (≥65 years) residing in the United States enrolled in a Medicare Part D or Medicare Advantage plan and had filled a prescription at a community pharmacy within the last 12 months. An orthogonal design resulted in 120 paired-choice tasks distributed equally across 10 survey blocks. Data were analyzed using mixed logit and latent class models. RESULTS: In total, 540 responses were collected, with the average age of respondents being 71 years. The majority of respondents were females (60%) and reported taking four or more prescription medication (51%). Service attribute levels with the highest utility were: 15-min intervention duration (0.392), discussion of services + a follow-up phone call (0.069), in-person at the pharmacy (0.328), provided by a pharmacist the patient knew (0.578), and no-cost (3.382). The attribute with the largest mWTP value was a service provided by a pharmacist the participant knew ($8.42). Latent class analysis revealed that patient preferences for service attributes significantly differed by gender and difficulty affording prescription medications. CONCLUSIONS: Quantifying patient preference using discrete choice methodology provides pharmacies with information needed to design service offerings that balance patient preference and sustainability. Pharmacies may consider providing interventions at no-cost to subsets of patients placing high importance on a service cost attribute. Further, patient preference for 15-min interventions may inform Medicare Part D service delivery and facilitate service sustainability.",1
Forensic Medical Examination After Sexual Violence: Implications Based on Victims' Perceptions.,"BACKGROUND/AIM: The objective of this study was to assess the perception of the forensic medical examination (FME) by victims of sexual violence. Based on patient-related outcomes gained in terms of personnel, chronological and spatial parameters, an additional aim was to derive improved examination procedures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 49 sexually assaulted women were enrolled in this study. After standardized FME by a forensic doctor followed by a gynecologist, women were asked to complete a questionnaire addressing general perception, preferences regarding attending staff's sex, sequence and time frame of the examinations performed. The attending gynecologist also completed a questionnaire addressing demographic and medical parameters of the patient as well as assault-related information. RESULTS: The examination setting in general was evaluated positively. Nevertheless, 52% of examined victims perceived the FME as an additional psychological burden. Overall, 85% of the affected women preferred a female forensic physician and 76% a female gynecologist to perform the examination. When women said they experienced a violation of their privacy during the gynecological examination, a male was more often present (60% vs. 35%, p=0.0866). Regarding the sequence of the examination components, 65% of the victims preferred to start with their medical history followed by the forensic and then the gynecological examination. CONCLUSION: Forensic medical and gynecological examination after sexual assault is an essential procedure, yet it is a potentially further traumatizing experience for the victim. The identified patient preferences should be taken into account in order to diminish further trauma.",0
Evaluating the Efficiency of Survey Collection Methods to Trauma Patients.,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic injury survivors often experience negative health consequences, impacting recovery. No studies have assessed the feasibility of evaluating the resiliency of hospitalized trauma patients using the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10). PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the most efficient method to collect survey responses on the CD-RISC-10. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used a convenience sample of admitted patients with traumatic injury. Patients were randomized to complete the CD-RISC-10 using pen and paper, tablet, or workstation on wheels. RESULTS: Of the 161 patient surveys, the tablet-based survey took the shortest time to complete (2 minutes, 21 seconds), and the paper survey resulted in the lowest percentage of missed questions (0.5%). Trauma patients reported high levels of resiliency. CONCLUSION: The CD-RISC-10 can be easily administered to trauma patients. Clinicians should balance efficiency and patient preferences when deciding on a survey collection method.",0
Patient-related outcomes and Oral Health-Related Quality of Life in endodontics.,"There is increased interest in outcome measures that complement the classic goal of endodontics, being the prevention and healing of apical periodontitis. Possible outcome measures can be subdivided into patient-centred outcomes (PCOs), encompassing data collected by nonpatients aiming to assess the effectiveness of an intervention and patient-reported outcomes (PROs), which are reported directly by the patient. PROs can be subsequently classed into PRO measures that ascertain patients' view of their symptoms, their functional status, and their health-related quality of life, and patient-reported experience measures that focus on aspects including the humanity of care, patient satisfaction, patient preference and adherence, personal costs, expectation fulfilment, and decision regrets. The present review aims to define various patient-related outcomes and discuss the literature available regarding PCOs and PROs in endodontics. This includes those proposed to assess the effectiveness of endodontic treatment for pulpitis and apical periodontitis for use in the development of European Society of Endodontology S3-level clinical practice guidelines that have been included by all working groups, except for the radiographic assessment of apical periodontitis. Based on limited evidence in the field, it can be summarized that after recall periods of various lengths, endodontic treatment is associated with a high likelihood of tooth survival and limited need for further intervention, including extraction and further restorative procedures. Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) is likely to improve following the completion of treatment. Nonetheless, the literature assessing the association between OHRQoL and endodontics is hampered by the use of instruments that have not been previously validated. Amongst the remaining outcome measures discussed in the present review, it is worth highlighting that there is only one study assessing exacerbations in teeth with the presence of endodontic pathosis, which suggests a very low incidence of this adverse effect following endodontic treatment. Patients' expectation fulfilment, adherence, and satisfaction are closely inter-related and depend also on various nonclinical factors. Further studies assessing PCOs and PROs, in association with healing and prevention of apical periodontitis, are required to better understand endodontic treatment from the perspective of patients.",0
Patient Preferences for Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests in Light of Lowering the Screening Age to 45 Years.,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: In 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force lowered the colorectal cancer (CRC) screening age to 45 years. We used conjoint analysis, a method that assesses complex decision making, to update our understanding on people's CRC screening test preferences in the context of new guidelines. METHODS: We conducted a conjoint analysis survey among unscreened individuals ≥40 years at average risk for CRC to determine the relative importance of screening test attributes in their decision making (eg, modality, effectiveness at reducing CRC risk, bowel prep). We also performed simulations to estimate the proportion of people who would prefer each US Multi-Society Task Force (MSTF) on CRC-recommended test. The analyses were stratified among those aged 40-49 years (newly or soon-to-be eligible for screening) and ≥50 years (have been eligible). RESULTS: Overall, 1000 participants completed the conjoint analysis (40-49 years, n = 456; ≥50 years, n = 544). When considering all 5 US MSTF-recommended tests, there were differences in test preferences between age groups (P = .019), and the most preferred test was a fecal immunochemical test (FIT)-fecal DNA every 3 years: 40-49 years, 34.6%; ≥50 years, 37.3%. When considering only the US MSTF tier 1 tests, most 40- to 49- (68.9%) and ≥50-year-olds (77.4%; P = .004) preferred an annual FIT over a colonoscopy every 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that more than one-third of people may want to do a FIT-fecal DNA every 3 years for their CRC screening. When only considering US MSTF tier 1 tests, three-fourths of people may prefer an annual FIT over colonoscopy. Further research examining CRC screening test preferences among broader populations is warranted to inform and enhance screening programs.",1
Refusal of Retreatment With Topical 5-Fluorouracil Among Patients With Actinic Keratosis: Qualitative Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Actinic keratosis (AK) is a common premalignant skin lesion, and topical 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is commonly used in field-directed therapy. However, 5-FU is associated with frequent local skin reactions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to qualitatively assess experiences among patients with AK who refuse retreatment with 5-FU. METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 10 adult participants who had received treatment with 5-FU for AK between January 1, 2017, and January 1, 2020, and refused future treatment with 5-FU. Results were analyzed using qualitative research methods. RESULTS: Although most participants had low concern upon having received a diagnosis of AK, most felt that treatment is very important. When initiating treatment with 5-FU, most cited recommendation by their health care professionals as the primary motivator and initially had low concern regarding treatment. The side effects associated with treatment were physically and psychosocially burdensome for most participants and led to temporary lifestyle adjustments. After treatment, most did not believe that their health care provider prepared them for treatment or were unsure. While half of the participants felt that 5-FU helped treat AKs, half were either unsure, due to premature discontinuation, or did not think that 5-FU treated their AKs. CONCLUSIONS: 5-FU is one of the most commonly prescribed treatments for AKs, yet most patients experienced both a physical and psychosocial burden with the treatment. Inability to assess efficacy due to premature discontinuation secondary to 5-FU-related reactions is common, and shared decision-making, navigating treatment options, and taking into account patient preferences may be critical to help assure better adherence and outcomes. Although our study was limited by input from participants who refused future treatment with 5-FU, most stated that they would still continue to seek treatment for AKs in the future and would consider other topical treatments, especially if associated with a milder tolerability profile.",0
Patient Risk-Benefit Preferences for Transcatheter Versus Surgical Mitral Valve Repair.,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) of mitral regurgitation is less invasive than surgery but has greater 5-year mortality and reintervention risks, and leads to smaller improvements in physical functioning. The study objective was to quantify patient preferences for risk-benefit trade-offs associated with TEER and surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: A discrete choice experiment survey was administered to patients with mitral regurgitation. Attributes included procedure type; 30-day mortality risk; 5-year mortality risk and physical functioning for 5 years; number of hospitalizations in the next 5 years; and risk of additional surgery in the next 5 years. A mixed-logit regression model was fit to estimate preference weights. Two hundred one individuals completed the survey: 63% were female and mean age was 74 years. On average, respondents preferred TEER over surgery. To undergo a less invasive procedure (ie, TEER), respondents would accept up to a 13.3% (95% CI, 8.7%-18.5%) increase in reintervention risk above a baseline of 10%, 4.6 (95% CI, 3.1-6.2) more hospitalizations above a baseline of 1, a 10.7% (95% CI, 6.5%-14.5%) increase in 5-year mortality risk above a baseline of 20%, or more limited physical functioning representing nearly 1 New York Heart Association class (0.7 [95% CI, 0.4-1.1]) over 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in general preferred TEER over surgery. When holding constant all other factors, a functional improvement from New York Heart Association class III to class I maintained over 5 years would be needed, on average, for patients to prefer surgery over TEER.",1
A surgical decision aid for occipital neuralgia with literature review and single center case series.,"BACKGROUND: Occipital neuralgia (ON) is a debilitating headache disorder. Due to the rarity of this disorder and lack of high-level evidence, a clear framework for choosing the optimal surgical approach for medically refractory ON incorporating shared decision making with patients does not exist. METHODS: A literature review of studies reporting pain outcomes of patients who underwent surgical treatment for ON was performed, as well as a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent surgery for ON within our institution. RESULTS: Thirty-two articles met the inclusion criteria. A majority of the articles were retrospective case series (22/32). The mean number of patients across the studies was 34 (standard deviation (SD) 39). Among the 13 studies that reported change in pain score on 10-point scales, a study of 20 patients who had undergone C2 and/or C3 ganglionectomies reported the greatest reduction in pain intensity after surgery. The studies evaluating percutaneous ablative methods including radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation showed the smallest reduction in pain scores overall. At our institution from 2014 to 2023, 11 patients received surgical treatment for ON with a mean follow-up of 187 days (SD 426). CONCLUSION: Based on these results, the first decision aid for selecting a surgical approach to medically refractory ON is presented. The algorithm prioritizes nerve sparing followed by non-nerve sparing techniques with the incorporation of patient preference. Shared decision making is critical in the treatment of ON given the lack of clear scientific evidence regarding the superiority of a particular surgical method.",0
Comparison of the effectiveness of local anesthesia for the digital block between single-volar subcutaneous and double-dorsal finger injections: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials.,"Local anesthesia is an effective method to perform digital nerve blocks. In this study, we compare the effectiveness of single-volar subcutaneous and double-dorsal injection through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to 7 April 2021 was performed. RCTs with the effects of single-volar subcutaneous and double-dorsal injection were eligible. Meta-analysis was performed using random effect models with pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RoB 2.0 and GRADE of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria were applied for evaluating the bias. A total of 2484 studies were initially identified, with 11 eligible RCTs finally included in the meta-analysis (1363 patients). The pooled data of nine studies showed single-volar injection had a statistically significantly lower pain score (pooled SMD: 0.20, 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.39, p = 0.041, I2 = 58%, N = 1187) and higher patient preference but invalid anesthesia at the dorsal proximal digit. No significant differences were observed in the onset of anesthesia, adjacent digit invalid numbness, distal phalanx invalid anesthesia, additional injection rate, and adverse effects. In conclusion, this meta-analysis of RCTs showed that the single-volar injection was associated with a lower pain sensation during injection and higher patient satisfaction with a reduced anesthetic effect over the proximal dorsal phalanx. Further high-quality RCTs with a higher number of cases are needed to validate our results.",0
First-in-man report of transsubclavian venous implantation of the Aveir leadless cardiac pacing system.,"INTRODUCTION: Transsubclavian venous implantation of the Aveir leadless cardiac pacemaker (LCP) has not been previously reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three cases of transsubclavian implantation of the Aveir LCP are reported. Two cases were postbilateral orthotopic lung transplant, without appropriate femoral or jugular access due to recent ECMO cannulation and jugular central venous catheters. In one case, there was strong patient preference for same-day discharge. Stability testing confirmed adequate fixation and electrical testing confirmed stable parameters in all cases. All patients tolerated the procedure well without significant immediate complications. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the feasibility of transsubclavian implantation of the Aveir LCP.",0
"Talking, not training, increased the accuracy of physicians' diagnosis of their patients' preferences for colon cancer screening.","OBJECTIVE: Identify if primary care physicians (PCPs) accurately understand patient preferences for colorectal cancer (CRC) testing, whether shared decision making (SDM) training improves understanding of patient preferences, and whether time spent discussing CRC testing improves understanding of patient preferences. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a trial comparing SDM training plus a reminder arm to a reminder alone arm. PCPs and their patients completed surveys after visits assessing whether they discussed CRC testing, patient testing preference, and time spent discussing CRC testing. We compared patient and PCP responses, calculating concordance between patient-physician dyads. Multilevel models tested for differences in preference concordance by arm or time discussing CRC. RESULTS: 382 PCP and patient survey dyads were identified. Most dyads agreed on whether CRC testing was discussed (82%). Only 52% of dyads agreed on the patient's preference. SDM training did not impact accuracy of PCPs preference diagnoses (55%v.48%,p = 0.22). PCPs were more likely to accurately diagnose patient's preferences when discussions occurred, regardless of length. CONCLUSION: Only half of PCPs accurately identified patient testing preferences. Training did not impact accuracy. Visits where CRC testing was discussed resulted in PCPs better understanding patient preferences. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: PCPs should take time to discuss testing and elicit patient preferences.",0
U.S. patient preferences for long-acting HIV treatment: a discrete choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Recent advances in long-acting antiretroviral therapy (LA-ART) could provide new options for HIV treatment and reduce adherence barriers, if regimens are acceptable to patients. We elicited preferences for key attributes of potential LA-ART regimens among people with HIV (PWH) in the United States, focusing on four treatment modes (oral tablets, subcutaneous injections, intramuscular injections, and implants), product characteristics and location of administration. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was conducted among PWH aged ≥18 years recruited from HIV clinics in Washington State and Atlanta, Georgia from March 2021 to June 2022. Participants responded to 17 choice scenarios, each with three options: two systematically generated hypothetical LA-ART regimens and a constant opt-out (their current daily oral treatment). LA-ART regimen descriptions included treatment mode, pain, dosing frequency, location, pre-treatment time with undetectable viral load, pre-treatment negative reaction testing and ""late-dose leeway"" (i.e. flexibility or forgiveness in timing the next dose). We used conditional logistic regression, with an interaction between treatment mode and pain, to estimate preference weights for all attribute levels. RESULTS: Seven hundred participants (350 at each site) enrolled, with median age 51 years (range 18-73); 70% identified as cisgender male, 24% as cisgender female and 6% as non-binary or transgender. LA oral tablets were the only mode preferred over current daily oral treatment, with annual implants and injections the next most preferred LA-ART option. Longer time between doses was preferred, and administration at home was preferred to clinics, which were preferred to pharmacies. Attributes with less impact on preferences included oral lead-in treatment to achieve viral suppression or test for negative reactions and late-dose leeway around the prescribed dosing interval. Participants in Atlanta were more likely to prefer their current daily oral ART than participants from Seattle. CONCLUSIONS: PWH in the United States may soon have several options for LA-ART. Our results suggest that LA oral tablets will be preferred by many patients over their current daily oral treatment, while implants and injections with longer duration may be acceptable to some. Future research should investigate sources of preference heterogeneity and actual uptake of and adherence to LA-ART products, when available.",1
"Increased versus conventional adalimumab dose interval for patients with Crohn's disease in stable remission (LADI): a pragmatic, open-label, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Despite its effectiveness in treating Crohn's disease, adalimumab is associated with an increased risk of infections and high health-care costs. We aimed to assess clinical outcomes of increased adalimumab dose intervals versus conventional dosing in patients with Crohn's disease in stable remission. METHODS: The LADI study was a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, non-inferiority, parallel, randomised controlled trial, done in six academic hospitals and 14 general hospitals in the Netherlands. Adults (aged ≥18 years) diagnosed with luminal Crohn's disease (with or without concomitant perianal disease) were eligible when in steroid-free clinical and biochemical remission (defined as Harvey-Bradshaw Index [HBI] score <5, faecal calprotectin <150 μg/g, and C-reactive protein <10 mg/L) for at least 9 months on a stable dose of 40 mg subcutaneous adalimumab every 2 weeks. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to the intervention group or control group by the coordinating investigator using a secure web-based system with variable block randomisation (block sizes of 6, 9, and 12). Randomisation was stratified on concomitant use of thiopurines and methotrexate. Patients and health-care providers were not masked to group assignment. Patients allocated to the intervention group increased adalimumab dose intervals to 40 mg every 3 weeks at baseline and further to every 4 weeks if they remained in clinical and biochemical remission at week 24. Patients in the control group continued their 2-weekly dose interval. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of persistent flares at week 48 defined as the presence of at least two of the following criteria: HBI score of 5 or more, C-reactive protein 10 mg/L or more, and faecal calprotectin more than 250 μg/g for more than 8 weeks and a concurrent decrease in the adalimumab dose interval or start of escape medication. The non-inferiority margin was 15% on a risk difference scale. All analyses were done in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03172377, and is not recruiting. FINDINGS: Between May 3, 2017, and July 6, 2020, 174 patients were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n=113) or the control group (n=61). Four patients from the intervention group and one patient from the control group were excluded from the analysis for not meeting inclusion criteria. 85 (50%) of 169 participants were female and 84 (50%) were male. At week 48, the cumulative incidence of persistent flares in the intervention group (three [3%] of 109) was non-inferior compared with the control group (zero; pooled adjusted risk difference 1·86% [90% CI -0·35 to 4·07). Seven serious adverse events occurred, all in the intervention group, of which two (both patients with intestinal obstruction) were possibly related to the intervention. Per 100 person-years, 168·35 total adverse events, 59·99 infection-related adverse events, and 42·57 gastrointestinal adverse events occurred in the intervention group versus 134·67, 75·03, and 5·77 in the control group, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The individual benefit of increasing adalimumab dose intervals versus the risk of disease recurrence is a trade-off that should take patient preferences regarding medication and the risk of a flare into account.

The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Ulcerative Colitis: Results from a Global Ulcerative Colitis Narrative Patient Survey.,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created challenges related to disease management of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: The UC Narrative COVID-19 survey was conducted from August to December 2021 among adults with UC from the United States, Canada, Japan, France, and Finland. Patients were questioned on disease management, health care access and experience, and preferences for interactions with their doctor. Data were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: In total, 584 patients qualified for and completed the survey. Compared with 2019, 25% experienced more flares during the pandemic (from early 2020). Most patients (88%) taking prescription medication were very/somewhat satisfied with their current treatment plan; 53% were hesitant to make changes during the pandemic. Factors that patients agreed helped control UC symptoms during the pandemic included fewer social outings (37%), working from home (29%), and less busy schedules (28%). Greater anxiety/stress (43%) and hesitancy to visit a hospital/office (34%) made the control of UC symptoms more difficult. Compared with 2019, more patients relied on certain alternative support systems during the pandemic. Patients who used in-person and virtual appointments were equally very satisfied/satisfied with the quality of care (both 81%). In-person appointments were preferred by 68% of patients when meeting a new doctor, 55% when experiencing a flare, and 52% for regular check-ups; 41% preferred virtual appointments for UC prescription refills. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, most patients were satisfied with their current UC treatment plan and access to care; more patients relied on certain alternative UC management support systems, and many were impacted by anxiety/stress.",0
The best defence is a good offence: Ensuring equitable access to primary care in Canada.,"Ensuring access to primary care is a persistent challenge in Canada, and the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing gaps. Public policy reform that only partially addresses these access issues, technological opportunities, workforce desires, or patient preferences creates an opportunity for private, investor-owned corporations to take ownership of primary care delivery systems. This article summarizes the history of the ""public-private"" conversation as it pertains to primary care, with a particular focus on investor-owned corporations. We outline how profit-driven, corporate healthcare impacts equitable access to care, increases spending on low-value services, and undermines the underlying values of Canadian healthcare systems. All of healthcare delivery requires rapid regulation and oversight by policy-makers, which would increase transparency of corporate care. There also must be parallel efforts placed on addressing the long-standing issues in publicly funded delivery of primary care that created the space for corporate care to grow.",0
Food Allergy Management Practices Utilizing Individual Patient Thresholds: A Work Group Report of the AAAAI Adverse Reactions to Foods Committee.,"The paradigm for food allergy management has been strict avoidance of the food allergen. There is literature supporting a ""high-threshold"" phenotype, those who tolerate a small-to-modest amount of allergen but react to larger amounts. There is no consensus for best practice for these ""high-threshold"" individuals. We sought to understand management practices of ""high-threshold"" reactors using a survey that was distributed to a random sample of fellows and members of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. There were 89 respondents from the United States and Canada (11% response rate), with 64 (72%) answering all questions. Participants worked in private (52%) and academic practice (38%) and saw a median of 30 food allergic patients monthly. Eighty-one percent of respondents reported management strategies other than strict avoidance. When threshold was known, strategies ranged from allowing ingestion up to a specified amount (57%), proactively advising ingestion to a certain amount (56%), or oral immunotherapy (47%). Participants were more likely to choose a permissive approach for a mild reaction in a high-threshold milk-allergic patient compared with a peanut-allergic patient (83% vs 71%, p=.01). Important factors that influenced the approach included severity of reaction (52%), comfort with family/patient using emergency medications (42%), and family/patient preferences (41%). These survey results suggest that food allergy management recommendations are no longer binary in nature, with clinicians solely recommending avoidance for those who are allergic and ingestion for those who may not be.",0
Clinician communication strategies to navigate differences of opinion with patients.,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated communication strategies clinicians reported using to navigate differences of opinion with patients regarding medical decisions. METHODS: Twenty physicians of various specialties participated in semi-structured interviews regarding their strategies for maintaining mutual respect when disagreeing with a patient. Reflexive thematic analysis was applied. Enrollment concluded upon theme saturation. RESULTS: In an attempt to limit disagreements, physicians learned to gauge patient values, often deferring to clinicians being the expert on medicine and patients being the expert on themselves. Physicians noticed that disagreements were reinforced by prioritizing educational approaches. Strengthening the relationship by validating patient emotions was seen as a more effective strategy. Clinicians found it difficult to weigh relative potential for benefit to the relationship and feelings of moral distress in capitulating to patient preferences they disagreed with. CONCLUSION: Physicians recognized the value of moving from educational to relationship building strategies to help limit and navigate disagreements. Key strategies include prioritizing gauging the patient's values and validating their emotions. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Anticipating disagreement, training clinicians to limit teaching, and instead prioritize a strong relationship to maintain trust and collaboration has the potential to improve patient health, with more limited resource use, and better experiences of care.",0
"A review of evidence, antimicrobial stability, and feasibility considerations for OPAT continuous infusion.","Outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) has been widely used in clinical practice for many decades because of its associated cost savings, reductions in inpatient hospital days, and decreases in hospital-associated infections. Despite this long history, evolving practice patterns and new drug delivery devices continue to present challenges as well as opportunities for clinicians when designing appropriate outpatient antimicrobial regimens. One such change is the increasing use of extended and continuous infusion (CI) of antimicrobials to optimize the achievement of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic targets. Elastomeric devices are also becoming increasingly popular in OPAT, including for the delivery of CI. In this article, we review the clinical evidence for CI in OPAT, as well as practical considerations of patient preferences, cost, and antimicrobial stability.",0
Preferences and decisional considerations relating to opioid agonist therapy among Ukrainian people who use drugs: A conjoint analysis survey.,"Scaling up opioid agonist therapies (OAT) is the most effective strategy to control combined HIV and opioid epidemics, especially in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA), where HIV incidence and mortality continue to increase. Patient concerns about OAT, however, have undermined scale-up. The objective of this study is to understand Ukrainian opioid use disorder patient preferences about OAT to guide the development of an evidence-informed decision aid for clinical decision-making. We conducted a conjoint-based choice (CBC) survey. Participants were asked to about their preferences relating to 7 attributes of OAT (cost, dosing frequency, concerns about withdrawal symptoms, adverse side effects, improvements in quality of life, precipitation of withdrawal and legislative requirements to be registered as a drug dependent person) and 20 attribute levels for receiving OAT under differing potential treatment constraints. Data were analyzed using Hierarchical Bayesian models. Using respondent-driven sampling and random sampling, we recruited 2,028 people who inject drugs with opioid use disorder. Relative importance (RIS) and partial-worth utility scores (PWUS) were used to assess preferences for attributes and thresholds within each attribute. Cost and dosing frequency were the most important attributes (RIS = 39.2% and RIS = 25.2%, respectively) to potential patients, followed by concerns about withdrawal symptoms (RIS = 10.8%), adverse side effects (RIS = 9.0%), quality-of-life improvement (RIS = 7.5%), precipitation of euphoria (5.2%) and requirement to be registered as a drug- dependent person (RIS = 3.1%). The monthly cost-threshold for willingness-to-pay was 1,900 UAH ($70 USD). In Ukraine, where both governmental and private OAT clinics have emerged and provide markedly different delivery strategies, preferences are mostly driven by out-of-pocket expenses, despite many patients being willing to pay for OAT. Programmatic demands (flexibility and ease of acquiring medications) remain an important consideration while for a minority, clinical concerns about withdrawal symptoms, adverse side effects and OAT impact on life play a smaller role.",1
Regional control after precision lymph node dissection for clinically evident melanoma metastasis.,"INTRODUCTION: Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for microscopic lymph node metastases has been replaced by observation; however, CLND is standard for clinically detectable nodal metastases (cLN). CLND has high morbidity, which may be reduced by excision of only the cLN (precision lymph node dissection [PLND]). We hypothesized that same-basin recurrence risk would be low after PLND. METHODS: Retrospective review at four tertiary care hospitals identified patients who underwent PLND. The primary outcome was 3-year cumulative incidence of isolated same-basin recurrence. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients underwent PLND for cLN without synchronous distant metastases. Reasons for forgoing CLND included patient preference (n = 11), comorbidities (n = 5), imaging indeterminate for distant metastases (n = 2), partial response to checkpoint blockade (n = 1), or not reported (n = 2). A median of 2 nodes (range: 1-6) were resected at PLND, and 68% contained melanoma. Recurrence was observed in 33% overall. Only 1 patient (5%) developed an isolated same-basin recurrence. Cumulative incidences at 3 years were 5.0%, 17.3%, and 49.7% for isolated same-basin recurrence, any same-basin recurrence, and any recurrence, respectively. Complications from PLND were reported in 1 patient (5%). CONCLUSIONS: These pilot data suggest that PLND may provide adequate regional disease control with less morbidity than CLND. These data justify prospective evaluation of PLND in select patients.",0
Translation and Cultural Adaptation of the Preferences for Everyday Living Inventory for Korean Nursing Home Settings.,"Valid and reliable measures are necessary to provide person-centered care. However, there are no such measures in Korean nursing home (NH) settings. The purpose of the current study was to translate and culturally adapt the Preferences for Everyday Living Inventory (PELI) into Korean following the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research guidelines. Face validity was assessed by cognitively capable Korean older adults (N = 10) using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree). Mean score was 2.7 (SD = 0.82) for grammar and wording; 3.7 (SD = 0.48) for understandability; and 3.7 (SD = 0.67) for cultural relevance. Participants found the Korean version of the PELI (PELI-K) easy to understand and interpret, and culturally relevant. Results suggest that the PELI was successfully translated and culturally adapted to Korean. Implementing the PELI-K in Korean NHs and incorporating individual preferences into care delivery will improve quality of care. [Journal of Gerontological Nursing, 49(5), 5-10.].",0
"POLST recall, concordance, and decision quality outcomes among nursing home residents and surrogate decision-makers.","BACKGROUND: POLST orders are actionable in an emergency, so it is important that the decisions be of high quality and concordant with current preferences. The goal of this study is to determine the relationship between concordance and decision quality outcomes, including decision satisfaction and decisional conflict, among nursing facility residents and surrogates who recall POLST. METHODS: We completed structured interviews in 29 nursing facilities with 275 participants who had previously signed a POLST form. This included residents who were still making their own medical decisions (n = 123) and surrogate decision-makers for residents without decisional capacity (n = 152). POLST recall was defined as remembering talking about and/or completing the POLST form previously signed by the participant. Concordance was determined by comparing preferences elicited during a standardized interview with the POLST form on file. Decisional conflict, decision satisfaction, and conversation quality were assessed with standardized tools. RESULTS: Half of participants (50%) remembered talking about or completing the POLST form, but recall was not associated with the length of time since POLST completion or concordance with existing preferences. In multivariable analyses, there was no association between POLST recall, concordance, and decision quality outcomes, though satisfaction was associated with conversation quality. CONCLUSIONS: Half of the residents and surrogates in this study recalled the POLST they previously signed. Neither the age of the form nor the ability to recall the POLST conversation should be considered indicators of whether existing POLST orders match current preferences. Findings confirm a relationship between POLST conversation quality and satisfaction, underscoring the importance of POLST completion as a communication process.",0
