Whether preferences of gastric cancer patients after surgery for follow-up change over time? Analysis based on discrete choice experiment.,"PURPOSES: The purposes of this discrete choice experiment are as follows: (1) quantify the relevant characteristics that may affect the follow-up selection of gastric cancer patients after surgery and (2) explore the differences in follow-up preferences of gastric cancer patients at different stages and reveal the change trend of preferences over time, thereby providing references for the formulation and optimization of follow-up strategies. METHODS: A survey instrument that was developed using the design principle of a discrete choice experiment investigated gastric cancer patients on the day of discharge, and at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after discharge. In Stata 15.0, a mixed logit model was used to explore the preferences of gastric cancer patients after surgery at different stages, the willingness to pay was calculated, and the NLCOM command was used to simulate the follow-up uptake rates of different attribute levels at different stages. RESULTS: On the day of discharge, and 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after discharge, the most important attribute levels of gastric cancer patients after surgery were ""thoroughness-very thorough,"" ""method-face-to-face,"" ""thoroughness-very thorough,"" and ""provider-specialist nurse,"" respectively, and patients were willing to pay more for these services. Patients' preference for the attribute level ""very thorough"" decreased over time, while their preferences for ""specialist doctors"" as follow-up providers remained relatively stable. Furthermore, the attribute levels with the greatest effect on receiving the baseline follow-up program varied across stages. CONCLUSION: The gastric cancer patients' preferences for follow-up change over time, and the time factor should be considered when developing follow-up strategies.",1
"Patient experience in community health services and first choice for medical attention: A cross-sectional study in Wuhan, China.","OBJECTIVES: In China, it is up to the patients to choose between hospitals and primary care facilities to initiate their medical care. This study aimed to determine the association between patient experience with community health centres (CHCs, a predominant provider of community-based primary care) and patient preference of taking community-based primary care facilities as a first choice for medical attention. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted on 1919 patients who sought medical care in 55 CHCs in Wuhan, China. Respondents were asked to identify their preferred first choice for medical attention and rate their satisfaction with eight aspects of CHCs (basic facility, medical equipment, medical services, nursing services, treatment process, courtesy and responsiveness, time spent with medical doctor, pharmacy services). Multivariate logistic regression models were established to determine the association between the CHC experience and the first choice of providers after adjustment for variations in sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Over 90% of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with the eight aspects of CHCs; but only 75% preferred to take community-based primary care facilities as their first choice for medical attention. Those who were older and had a lower income were more likely to choose community-based primary care facilities. Geographic proximity and higher levels of satisfaction with the basic facility, courtesy and responsiveness, and pharmacy services in the CHCs were associated with a higher likelihood of taking community-based primary care facilities as a first choice for medical attention. CONCLUSION: The consumers of CHCs are generally satisfied with the services they received. However, one quarter of the CHC patients are yet to be convinced to accept community-based primary care facilities as a preferred first provider for medical care. Geographic proximity and patient experience with CHCs are associated with the patient choice.",0
Coping with COVID: Performance of China's hierarchical medical system during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the health system worldwide. This study aimed to assess how China's hierarchical medical system (HMS) coped with COVID-19 in the short-and medium-term. We mainly measured the number and distribution of hospital visits and healthcare expenditure between primary and high-level hospitals during Beijing's 2020-2021 pandemic relative to the 2017-2019 pre-COVID-19 benchmark period. METHODS: Hospital operational data were extracted from Municipal Health Statistics Information Platform. The COVID-19 period in Beijing was divided into five phases, corresponding to different characteristics, from January 2020 to October 2021. The main outcome measures in this study include the percentage change in inpatient and outpatient emergency visits, and surgeries, and changing distribution of patients between different hospital levels across Beijing's HMS. In addition, the corresponding health expenditure in each of the 5 phases of COVID-19 was also included. RESULTS: In the outbreak phase of the pandemic, the total visits of Beijing hospitals declined dramatically, where outpatient visits fell 44.6%, inpatients visits fell 47.9%; emergency visits fell 35.6%, and surgery inpatients fell 44.5%. Correspondingly, health expenditures declined 30.5% for outpatients and 43.0% for inpatients. The primary hospitals absorbed a 9.51% higher proportion of outpatients than the pre-COVID-19 level in phase 1. In phase 4, the number of patients, including non-local outpatients reached pre-pandemic 2017-2019 benchmark levels. The proportion of outpatients in primary hospitals was only 1.74% above pre-COVID-19 levels in phases 4 and 5. Health expenditure for both outpatients and inpatients reached the baseline level in phase 3 and increased nearly 10% above pre-COVID-19 levels in phases 4 and 5. CONCLUSION: The HMS in Beijing coped with the COVID-19 pandemic in a relatively short time, the early stage of the pandemic reflected an enhanced role for primary hospitals in the HMS, but did not permanently change patient preferences for high-level hospitals. Relative to the pre-COVID-19 benchmark, the elevated hospital expenditure in phase 4 and phase 5 pointed to hospital over-treatment or patient excess treatment demand. We suggest improving the service capacity of primary hospitals and changing the preferences of patients through health education in the post-COVID-19 world.",0
Intimate Partner Violence.,"IPV is a widespread and destructive public health problem that impacts women across the world and the lifespan. IPV encompasses a wide range of negative behaviors towards a person's romantic partner which include physical aggression, sexual violence, stalking, psychological torment, and coercive behaviors. Persons who experience IPV face a wide range of debilitating physical, mental health, and financial outcomes compared to those who have never experienced violence. Physicians play an important role in caring for patients who have experienced violence; knowledge of IPV's impact, consequences, treatment, and patient preferences around IPV discussions can lead to improved patient satisfaction and outcomes.",0
Category of upper eyelid morphology and the preferred double eyelid shape in Asians according to questionnaire survey.,"BACKGROUND: The morphological classification of the upper eyelid in Asian people is complex and diverse and usually not consistent with what we know well. AIMS: To improve the classification of upper eyelid morphology and investigate the preferred double eyelid shape by Asian people. METHODS: An investigation of 640 patients' preferences for double eyelid shape was conducted, and the pre- and post-operative effects were assessed. The shapes of the natural eyelids of 247 people (485 eyes) who provided real photographs of the eyelids were counted. The chi-square test was used to analyze the differences. RESULTS: There were 10 eyelid shapes: single eyelid, parallel-shaped double eyelid, fan-shaped double eyelid, parallel fan-shaped double eyelid, opened fan-shaped double eyelid, crescent-shaped double eyelid, hidden-shaped double eyelid, horizontal-shaped double eyelid, triangle-shaped double eyelid, and multiple-fold eyelid. The difference in the shape of the natural eyelid between males and females was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The most popular eyelid shapes were single eyelid (24.9%), open fan-shaped double eyelid (21.0%), fan-shaped double eyelid (16.3%), and hidden-shaped double eyelid (12.6%). Men and women preferred a parallel fan-shaped double eyelid (18.0%), a parallel-shaped double eyelids (17.0%), and an open fan-shaped double eyelids (18.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The most popular upper eyelid shapes were single eyelid, open fan-shaped double eyelid, and fan-shaped double eyelid. The parallel fan-shaped, parallel-shaped, and open fan-shaped double eyelid were favored by men and women.",0
Efficacy of Vaccine Protection Against COVID-19 Virus Infection in Patients with Chronic Liver Diseases.,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 is a useful weapon to combat the virus. Patients with chronic liver diseases (CLDs), including compensated or decompensated liver cirrhosis and noncirrhotic diseases, have a decreased immunologic response to coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines. At the same time, they have increased mortality if infected. Current data show a reduction in mortality when patients with chronic liver diseases are vaccinated. A suboptimal vaccine response has been observed in liver transplant recipients, especially those receiving immunosuppressive therapy, so an early booster dose is recommended to achieve a better protective effect. Currently, there are no clinical data comparing the protective efficacy of different vaccines in patients with chronic liver diseases. Patient preference, availability of the vaccine in the country or area, and adverse effect profiles are factors to consider when choosing a vaccine. There have been reports of immune-mediated hepatitis after coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination, and clinicians should be aware of that potential side effect. Most patients who developed hepatitis after vaccination responded well to treatment with prednisolone, but an alternative type of vaccine should be considered for subsequent booster doses. Further prospective studies are required to investigate the duration of immunity and protection against different viral variants in patients with chronic liver diseases or liver transplant recipients, as well as the effect of heterologous vaccination.",0
Patients' Perspectives Regarding Generator Exchanges of Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators.,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making is mandated for patients receiving primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). Less attention has been paid to generator exchange decisions, although at the time of generator exchange, patients' risk of sudden cardiac death, risk of procedural complications, quality of life, or prognosis may have changed. This study was designed to explore how patients make ICD generator exchange decisions. METHODS: Emory Healthcare patients with primary prevention ICDs implanted from 2013 to 2021 were recruited to complete in-depth interviews exploring perspectives regarding generator exchanges. Interviews were conducted in 2021. Transcribed interviews were qualitatively coded using multilevel template analytic methods. To investigate benefit thresholds for pursuing generator exchanges, patients were presented standard-gamble type hypothetical scenarios where their ICD battery was depleted but their 5-year risk of sudden cardiac death at that time varied (10%, 5%, and 1%). RESULTS: Fifty patients were interviewed; 18 had a prior generator exchange, 16 had received ICD therapy, and 17 had improved left ventricular ejection fraction. As sudden cardiac death risk decreased from 10% to 5% to 1%, the number of participants willing to undergo a generator exchange decreased from 48 to 42 to 33, respectively. Responses suggest that doctor's recommendations are likely to substantially impact patients' decision-making. Other drivers of decision-making included past experiences with ICD therapy and device implantation, as well as risk aversion. Therapeutic inertia and misconceptions about ICD therapy were common and represent substantive barriers to effective shared decision-making in this context. CONCLUSIONS: Strong defaults may exist to continue therapy and exchange ICD generators. Updated risk stratification may facilitate shared decision-making and reduce generator exchanges in very low-risk patients, especially if these interventions are directed toward clinicians. Interventions targeting phenomena such as therapeutic inertia may be more impactful and warrant exploration in randomized trials.",1
"Photography in dermatology - a scoping review: Practices, skin of color, patient preferences, and medical-legal considerations.","Clinical photography is essential in dermatology. However, a comprehensive literature review of photography in dermatology is lacking. This scoping review aims to summarize the literature regarding photography practices in dermatology, photography of skin of color, patient preferences, and medical-legal considerations. A search was conducted utilizing Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Evidence Based Medicine databases in accordance with the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews. In total, 33 studies were summarized. Clinical photography is commonly used in biopsy site marking, assessment, diagnosis, disease monitoring, evaluation of treatment response, medical education, research, seeking advice from colleagues, and teledermatology. Although dermatologic photography remains devoid of skin of color representation, photographic considerations for darker skin are available. Most patients support medical photography, with a preference for clinical photographs to be taken by their own physicians, and for use of clinic/hospital-owned cameras over personal devices. Pertinent medical-legal issues include concerns around privacy, personal device use, and documentation of consent. Photography in dermatology is continuously evolving with broader applications. Improved practices and innovations will benefit individuals of various skin tones. Management of consent and privacy must be upheld to sustain the increasing ease of image capture and sharing.",0
Clinical Inertia Among Outpatients With Heart Failure: Application of Treatment Nonintensification Taxonomy to EPIC-HF Trial.,"BACKGROUND: The contribution of clinical inertia to suboptimal guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: This study examined reasons for GDMT nonintensification and characterized clinical inertia. METHODS: In this secondary analysis of EPIC-HF (Electronically Delivered, Patient-Activation Tool for Intensification of Medications for Chronic Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction), a randomized clinical trial evaluating a patient-activation tool on GDMT utilization, we performed a sequential, explanatory mixed-methods study. Reasons for nonintensification among 4 medication classes were assigned according to an expanded published taxonomy using structured chart reviews. Audio transcripts of clinic encounters were analyzed to further characterize nonintensification reasons. Integration occurred during the interpretation phase. RESULTS: Among 292 HFrEF patients who completed a cardiology visit, 185 (63.4%) experienced no treatment intensification, of whom 90 (48.6%) had at least 1 opportunity for intensification of a medication class with no documented contraindication or barriers (ie, clinical inertia). Nonintensification reasons varied by medication class, and included heightened risk of adverse effects (range 18.2%-31.6%), patient nonadherence (range 0.8%-1.1%), patient preferences and beliefs (range 0.6%-0.9%), comanagement with other providers (range 4.6%-5.6%), prioritization of other issues (range 15.6%-31.8%), multiple categories (range 16.5%-22.7%), and clinical inertia (range 22.7%-31.6%). A qualitative analysis of 32 clinic audio recordings demonstrated common characteristics of clinical inertia: 1) clinician review of medication regimens without education or intensification discussions; 2) patient stability as justification for nonintensification; and 3) shorter encounters for nonintensification vs intensification. CONCLUSIONS: In this comprehensive study exploring HFrEF prescribing, clinical inertia is a main contributor to nonintensification within an updated taxonomy classification for suboptimal GDMT prescribing. This approach should help target strategies overcoming GDMT underuse.",0
Reproductive Planning: Contraceptive Counseling and Nonhormonal Methods.,"More than 65% of US women ages 15 to 49 years use contraception every year, many of whom seek care with family medicine. Family physicians are well equipped to provide comprehensive contraceptive counseling to patients in the primary care setting. When discussing options and providing education to patients, clinicians should consider patient preferences, patient autonomy, and adverse effect concerns, and should use a patient-centered approach that upholds the principles of reproductive justice. Nonhormonal methods of contraception include barrier methods and spermicides, fertility awareness-based methods, and (in postpartum individuals) lactational amenorrhea. With barrier methods, spermicides, and fertility awareness-based methods, 13 to 29 out of 100 women may become pregnant. Permanent forms of contraception include female and male sterilization procedures, which are some of the most effective (more than 99% effective) and most commonly used methods in the United States.",0
Patient's Perspective on Psychiatric Drugs: A Multicenter Survey-Based Study.,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the expectations and preferences for medication and medical decision-making in patients with major psychiatric disorders. METHODS: A survey was conducted among patients with major psychiatric disorders who visited psychiatric outpatient clinics at 15 hospitals between 2016 and 2018 in Korea. The survey consisted of 12 questions about demographic variables and opinions on their expectations for medication, important medical decision-makers, and preferred drug type. The most preferred value in each category in the total population was identified, and differences in the preference ratio of each item among the disease groups were compared. RESULTS: A total of 707 participants were surveyed. In the total population, patients reported high efficacy (44.01%±21.44%) as the main wish for medication, themselves (37.39%±22.57%) and a doctor (35.27%±22.88%) as the main decision makers, and tablet/capsule (36.16%±30.69%) as the preferred type of drug. In the depressive disorders group, the preference ratio of high efficacy was significantly lower, and the preference ratio of a small amount was significantly higher than that of the psychotic disorder and bipolar disorder groups. The preference ratio of a doctor as an important decision maker in the bipolar disorder group was higher compared to the other groups. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the preference for medications and showed differences among patients with psychiatric disorders. Providing personalized medicine that considers a patient's preference for the drug may contribute to the improvement of drug compliance and outcomes.",0
Effectiveness of patient decision aid supported shared decision-making intervention in in-person and virtual hybrid pulmonary rehabilitation in older adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A pilot randomized controlled trial.,"INTRODUCTION: Tele-pulmonary rehabilitation is increasingly advocated but cannot completely substitute for in-person services for chronic conditions. Adherence to Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) remains low in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Shared decision-making (SDM) promotes patients' participation in PR decisions and helps patients and healthcare providers to jointly make decisions that patients are informed and aligned with patient preferences and values, which are critical for patient adherence to PR. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a hybrid in-person and virtual model of home-based PR services for older COPD patients and study the effectiveness of the patient decision aid (PDA)-supported recurring SDM intervention on patient adherence to PR, rehabilitation outcomes, and decision-related outcomes, as well as to explore the mechanisms of the intervention on PR adherence. METHODS: A total of 78 older COPD patients were randomly assigned to the PR group (n = 39) or PDA-PR group (n = 39). Both groups were conducted hybrid in-person and virtual PR intervention for 3 months. The primary outcomes were patients' quality of life and PR adherence. The secondary outcomes were dyspnea symptoms, exercise self-efficacy, knowledge, and decision-related outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 72 participants completed the 3-month PR program. There were statistically significant differences in PR adherence (p = 0.033), COPD assessment test (CAT) scores (p = 0.016), PR knowledge (p < 0.001), decision self-efficacy (p < 0.001), decision conflict (p < 0.001), and decision regret scores (p = 0.027) between the two groups. The modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea scale (mMRC) score was significantly decreased only in PDA-PR group (p = 0.011). No statistically significant differences were observed in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score (p = 0.078), Exercise Self-Regulatory Efficacy Scale (Ex-SRES) score (p = 0.29) and COPD knowledge (p = 0.086) between the two groups. PR value score had a significant effect on adherence to PR (p = 0.007) and CAT score (p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: PDA supported recurring SDM intervention was helpful in maintaining older COPD patients' PR adherence and had advantages in improving quality of life, enhancing PR knowledge, decision self-efficacy, and reducing decision conflict and decision regret, but did not improve SGRQ and Ex-SRES. PR value score influenced patients' rehabilitation adherence and quality of life.

"Hereditary colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer: comprehensive review.","BACKGROUND: Inheritance patterns show familial clustering of gastrointestinal cancers, and multiple germline conditions have now been identified that predispose to colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancers. METHODS: A narrative review based on recent relevant literature was conducted. RESULTS: Lynch syndrome, formerly known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, increases the risk of several abdominal cancers, with the highest population prevalence. Familial adenomatous polyposis and some of the more infrequent polyposis syndromes have distinct characteristics affecting various organ-specific cancer risks. Hereditary gastric and pancreatic cancer syndromes include those also causing colorectal cancer, while additional genetic disorders predisposing only to upper gastrointestinal malignancies have been recognized more recently. Diagnosing and managing hereditary cancer syndromes requires multidisciplinary expertise and may be best managed in tertiary centres, with a need to consider patient preference and ensure shared decision-making. CONCLUSION: Several germline conditions predispose to colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer, which inform identification, surveillance regimens, prevention, cascade screening, counselling, and surgical management. The authors describe developments in the hereditary origin of colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer with current recommendations in surveillance and surgical management.",0
Experiences of people with multiple sclerosis and clinicians in using cognitive behavioural therapies for hidden symptoms: a systematic review and meta-aggregation.,"PURPOSE: Cognitive behavioural therapies (CBTs) are a standard of care for treatment of many 'hidden symptoms' in people with MS (PwMS), such as stress, depression, and fatigue. However, these interventions can vary widely in formatting and may not be tailored for PwMS. To optimize CBTs for MS, understanding the experiences of PwMS and clinicians is essential. This systematic review and meta-aggregation synthesizes existing qualitative data on stakeholder perspectives of CBTs for PwMS. METHODS: Systematic searches across five major electronic databases were conducted. Studies reporting qualitative data were identified. Two reviewers performed screening, quality assessment, data extraction, and certainty of evidence assessments. Meta-aggregation was performed as per the Joanna Briggs Institute approach, entailing qualitative data extraction, developing categories, and synthesizing overall findings. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were included in this review, comprising data from 653 PwMS and 47 clinicians. In the meta-aggregation, 122 qualitative results were extracted and grouped into nine categories. Categories were then combined into six synthesized findings: (1) setting the context-life with MS, (2) reasons for participating in CBTs, (3) acceptability of and experiences with participating in CBTs, (4) perceived benefits of CBTs, (5) perceived challenges with CBTs, and (6) suggestions to improve CBTs for PwMS. CONCLUSIONS: A range of benefits including psychological, social, and lifestyle improvements were reported, but varied based on the design of the CBT intervention. Future CBT interventions should be tailored to participant needs, delivered in group settings, offer online options, and be delivered by a trained facilitator familiar with MS. Further exploration of the ideal CBT design for PwMS, as well as engagement with caregivers and clinicians treating MS, is warranted.",0
Preferences of patients with chronic low back pain about nonsurgical treatments: Results of a discrete choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to assess patients' preferences of nonsurgical treatments for chronic low back pain (CLBP). METHOD: We conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) in Quebec, Canada, in 2018. Seven attributes were included: treatment modality, pain reduction, the onset of treatment efficacy, duration effectiveness, difficulties with daily activities, sleep problems, and knowledge of the patient's body and pain location. Treatment modalities were corticosteroid injections, supervised body-mind physical activities, supervised sports physical activities, physical manipulations, self-management courses, and psychotherapy. Utility levels were estimated using a logit model, a latent class model and a Bayesian hierarchical model. RESULTS: Analyses were conducted on 424 individuals. According to the Bayesian hierarchical model, the conditional relative importance weights of attributes were as follows: (1) treatment modality (34.79%), (2) pain reduction (18.73%), (3) difficulties with daily activities (11.71%), (4) duration effectiveness (10.06%), (5) sleep problems (10.05%), (6) onset of treatment efficacy (8.60%) and (7) knowledge of the patient's body and pain location (6.06%). According to the latent class model that found six classes of respondents with different behaviours (using Akaike and Bayesian criteria), the treatment modality was the most important attribute for all classes, except for class 4 for which pain reduction was the most important. In addition, classes 2 and 5 refused corticosteroid injections, while psychotherapy was preferred only in class 3. CONCLUSION: Given the preference heterogeneity found in the analysis, it is important that patient preferences are discussed and considered by the physicians. This will help to improve the patient care pathway in a context of a patient-centred model for a disease with growing prevalence. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: A small group of patients was involved in the conception, design and interpretation of data. Participants in the DCE were all CLBP patients.",1
Preferences for support in managing symptoms of an asthma flare-up: a pilot study of a discrete choice experiment.,"Objective: Information on the preferences of people with asthma for support in managing a flare-up can inform service design which may facilitate appropriate help-seeking. To date, little is known about support preferences for managing a flare-up. The aim of this study was to develop and pilot a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit the preferences of people with asthma with regards to support in managing a flare-up.Methods: Steps in developing the DCE included identification and selection of attributes and levels of the support services, construction of choice tasks, experimental design, construction of DCE instrument, and pretest (n=16) and pilot (n=38) studies of the DCE instrument. A multinomial logit model was used to examine the strength and direction of the six attributes in the pilot study.Results: Our results indicate that from a patient perspective, having a healthcare professional that listens to their concerns was the most valued attribute of support in asthma flare-up management. The other features of support valued by participants were timely access to consultation, a healthcare professional with knowledge of their patient history, a specialist doctor and face-to-face communication. Having a written action plan was the least valued attribute.Conclusions: Our findings suggest patient preference for a model of support in managing their symptoms which includes timely, face-to-face access to a healthcare professional that knows them and listens to their concerns. The findings of the pilot study need to be verified with a larger sample and using models to account for preference heterogeneity.",1
Decision aids for patients with carotid stenosis.,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making tools have been underused by clinicians in real-world practice. Changes to the National Coverage Determination by Medicare for carotid stenting greatly expand the coverage for patients, but simultaneously require a shared decision-making interaction that involves the use of a validated tool. Accordingly, our objective was to evaluate the currently available decision aids for carotid stenosis. METHODS: We conducted a review of the literature for published work on decision aids for the treatment of carotid disease. RESULTS: Four publications met inclusion criteria. We found the format of the decision aid impacted patient comprehension and decision making, although patient characteristics also played a role in the therapeutic decisions made. Notably, none of the available decision aids included the widely adopted transcarotid artery revascularization as an option. CONCLUSIONS: Further work is needed in the development of a widespread validated decision aid instrument for patients with carotid stenosis.",0
Pancreatitis sepsis: Evolution and principles in the management of necrotizing pancreatitis.,"Outcomes from some recent clinical trials have helped to improve the management of necrotizing pancreatitis over the last 2 decades. The location of the retroperitoneal collection, previous gastric surgery, patient preference, and medical expertise dictates a minimally invasive surgical step-up versus endoscopic approach. Endoscopic drainage is facilitated by either a plastic or metallic stent. Direct endoscopic necrosectomy is performed for lack of improvement after endoscopic drainage. The surgical approach is accomplished by minimally invasive surgery with either video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement or laparoscopic drainage. A multidisciplinary team with appropriate expertise should care for patients with necrotizing pancreatitis. This brief review summarizes the landmark clinical trials, compares the benefits and roles of endoscopic, surgical, and percutaneous interventions, and discusses treatment algorithms for necrotizing pancreatitis in the modern era.",0
Is Nonoperative Management of Rectal Cancer Feasible?,"During the past decade, the treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) has become more complex. Total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT) has increased the rates of both clinical and pathologic complete response, resulting in improved long-term oncological outcomes. The feasibility to implement nonoperative management (NOM) depends on solving current challenges such as how to correctly identify the best candidates for a NOM without compromising oncologic safety. NOM should be part of the treatment discussion of LARC, considering increasing rates of clinical complete response, potential quality of life gains, avoidance of surgical morbidity, and patient preferences.",0
Abortion terminology preferences: a cross-sectional survey of people accessing abortion care.,"BACKGROUND: Abortion stigma likely affects the terminology abortion patients, providers and the public use or avoid using to refer to abortion care. Knowing the terminology people seeking abortion prefer could help inform the language used in clinical interactions and improve patients' experiences with abortion care. However, research in the U.S. has not examined patients' preferences in this area or whether terminology preferences vary by participant characteristics, in the way that experiences of stigma vary across different contexts and communities. This study aims to describe preferred terminology among people presenting for abortion care and to explore the pregnancy-related characteristics associated with these preferences. METHODS: We surveyed abortion patients about their experiences accessing abortion care, including preferred terms for the procedure. Respondents could mark more than one term, suggest their own term, or indicate no preference. We recruited people ages 15-45 seeking abortion from four U.S. abortion facilities located in three states (California, Illinois, and New Mexico) from January to June 2019. We used descriptive statistics and multivariable multinomial logistic regression to explore associations between respondents' pregnancy-related characteristics and their preferred terminology. RESULTS: Among the 1092 people approached, 784 (77%) initiated the survey and 697 responded to the terminology preference question. Most participants (57%, n = 400) preferred only one term. Among those participants, ""abortion"" (43%) was most preferred, followed by ""ending a pregnancy"" (29%), and ""pregnancy termination"" (24%). In adjusted multivariable models, participants who worried ""very much"" that other people might find out about the abortion (29%) were significantly more likely than those who were ""not at all"" worried (13%) to prefer ""ending a pregnancy"" over having no preference for a term (adjusted relative risk ratio: 2.68, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.46-4.92). CONCLUSIONS: People seeking abortion have varied preferences for how they want to refer to their abortions, in particular if they anticipate abortion stigma. Findings can be useful for clinicians and researchers so that they can be responsive to people's preferences during clinical interactions and in the design and conduct of abortion research.",0

Transgender Patient Preferences When Discussing Gender in Health Care Settings.,"IMPORTANCE: Transgender (trans) patients report frequent discriminatory and harmful experiences in health care settings; gender-affirming, competent health care improves trans individuals' health and well-being. OBJECTIVE: To identify factors influencing trans patients' decision-making regarding sharing gender-related information with providers (clinicians, health care organizations, health care systems) and trans patient preferences for gender-related questions, as well as the subsequent impact on health care experiences. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A qualitative, interpretivist phenomenological study was conducted via telephone or video (using Zoom) in English and Spanish from August 10 to September 11, 2020. Participants were recruited via trans-specific social media groups and email listservs. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed from October 2020 to January 2022 using thematic analysis by a majority trans research team. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Semistructured interviews explored patient health care experiences and preferences. RESULTS: Participants included 27 trans and/or nonbinary adults (mean [SD] age, 30.9 [10.4] years; range, 21-69 years) from 13 US states. Four themes were identified: (1) impact of provider behaviors, (2) engaging in relational risk assessment, (3) receiving affirming vs medically competent care, and (4) ""how are you going to fit [me] into your system?"" The first theme reflected the impact of provider actions, including level of flexibility in care and interpersonal interactions, ability to explain medical relevance of gender-related questions, and preparedness to work with trans patients. Second, respondents weighed a variety of implicit or explicit safety cues when deciding whether and how to share information with providers. Third, participants spoke at length about affirming and medically competent care, noting that they have had to prioritize one over the other. Last, participants reported their needs often being at odds with health care system norms and standards of care. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this qualitative study of trans patient preferences when discussing gender-related information with providers, it was found that equitable, gender-affirming, and competent health care requires flexibility and responsiveness to patient preferences. It requires provider humility and engagement, as well as institutional policies that support competent and gender-affirming spaces. Future research could identify additional roles that providers, administrators, and systems can play in ensuring competent care for trans patients.",0
Telehealth Access and Substitution in the VHA.,"BACKGROUND: In response to COVID-19, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) expanded telehealth availability, allowing veterans to receive care at home. We explore the extent of substitution of telehealth for in-person care among medical centers (facilities), providers, and patients. We explore the extent to which patient preferences drive telehealth utilization, and compare access to care (as measured by waiting times) for telehealth and in-person visits. METHODS: We use VHA electronic health records to identify scheduled outpatient mental health (MH) appointments from January 2019 through February 2023 focusing on care delivered by social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists. For each quarter, we compute the proportion of completed appointments that were delivered via phone or video by each facility, provider, and patient and show the changes in these proportions before, during, and after the onset of COVID-19. To explore patient preferences, we match providers of patients with high rates of telehealth utilization and examine the extent to which those providers deliver in-person care. To examine access to care, we compute waiting times for in-person, video, and phone new patient appointments. We investigate differences between urban and rural patients, and patients of different ages. KEY RESULTS: Telehealth for MH grew dramatically in the VHA after the onset of COVID-19. While some facilities provided more telehealth than others, all facilities (as of early 2023) provided some telehealth MH services. Approximately 86% of individual providers provided telehealth, with 27% scheduling MH appointments almost exclusively as telehealth appointments and 59% providing a mix. Patients exhibited more polarization, with 36% scheduling only in-person visits for almost all their MH visits and 56% of them scheduling exclusively telehealth, and only 8% of them utilizing a mix of modalities. Of those who exclusively received telehealth care, a majority of them utilized video (80%) over phone (20%). Take-up of MH among younger patients was higher relative to older patients. Urban patients used telehealth more than rural patients. Patient preferences rather than provider preferences drove utilization of patients who almost exclusively utilized telehealth. Between April 2021 and February 2023, the average difference in waiting time for in-person and video appointments was less than 1 day, with comparable appointment volumes, suggesting that the supply of and demand for in-person and video were not different enough to merit waiting longer. Telehealth was chosen over in-person more among urban and younger patients, as older and rural patients exhibited higher willingness to wait for in-person over video appointments. By contrast, appointment volumes and waiting times for phone appointments were lower across all groups, suggesting that phone may not be as substitutable for in-person visits in MH. CONCLUSIONS: We find that the VHA has made telehealth widely available, providing access to many veterans. While telehealth utilization has increased, face-to-face care persists for MH services, suggesting that one modality may not serve all purposes and preferences for care. Patient preferences drive the modality decision among those who exclusively use MH care via telehealth. For those who persist in mostly utilizing in-person care, there may be various factors influencing those preferences such as issues with limited internet connectivity, language barriers, and digital literacy, especially for older and rural patients who utilize in-person care more than those who are younger and more urban. Further investigation is required to investigate the optimal mix of modalities which may allow for potential increases in patient satisfaction, quality of care, and clinic efficiency.",0
"Localization Techniques for Non-Palpable Breast Lesions: Current Status, Knowledge Gaps, and Rationale for the MELODY Study (EUBREAST-4/iBRA-NET, NCT 05559411).","BACKGROUND: Surgical excision of a non-palpable breast lesion requires a localization step. Among available techniques, wire-guided localization (WGL) is most commonly used. Other techniques (radioactive, magnetic, radar or radiofrequency-based, and intraoperative ultrasound) have been developed in the last two decades with the aim of improving outcomes and logistics. METHODS: We performed a systematic review on localization techniques for non-palpable breast cancer. RESULTS: For most techniques, oncological outcomes such as lesion identification and clear margin rate seem either comparable with or better than for WGL, but evidence is limited to small cohort studies for some of the devices. Intraoperative ultrasound is associated with significantly higher negative margin rates in meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Radioactive techniques were studied in several RCTs and are non-inferior to WGL. Smaller studies show higher patient preference towards wire-free localization, but little is known about surgeons' and radiologists' attitudes towards these techniques. CONCLUSIONS: Large studies with an additional focus on patient, surgeon, and radiologist preference are necessary. This review aims to present the rationale for the MELODY (NCT05559411) study and to enable standardization of outcome measures for future studies.",0
Estimating optimal individualized treatment rules with multistate processes.,"Multistate process data are common in studies of chronic diseases such as cancer. These data are ideal for precision medicine purposes as they can be leveraged to improve more refined health outcomes, compared to standard survival outcomes, as well as incorporate patient preferences regarding quantity versus quality of life. However, there are currently no methods for the estimation of optimal individualized treatment rules with such data. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric outcome weighted learning approach for this problem in randomized clinical trial settings. The theoretical properties of the proposed methods, including Fisher consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimated expected outcome under the estimated optimal individualized treatment rule, are rigorously established. A consistent closed-form variance estimator is provided and methodology for the calculation of simultaneous confidence intervals is proposed. Simulation studies show that the proposed methodology and inference procedures work well even with small-sample sizes and high rates of right censoring. The methodology is illustrated using data from a randomized clinical trial on the treatment of metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck.",0
Health involvement modulates physician preference in the brain during online health consultation.,"In traditional offline health-seeking behavior, patients consistently exhibit a preference for similar types of physicians due to limited access to physicians' information. Nevertheless, with the advent of online health consultation platforms offering comprehensive physicians' information for patients, raises the question: do patients continue to exhibit uniform preference for physicians? To address this issue, we first employed a behavioral experiment to discern patients' preferences for different types of physicians' information under different health involvement, and then conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment to furnish neural/physiological evidence. The results showed that health involvement modulates patients' preferences, when health involvement was low, patients had diverse preferences for physicians, that is, different types of physicians' information could individually impact patients' choice and could serve as substitutes for each other. When health involvement was high, patients' preference for physicians were uniform, highlighting that the collective influence of different types of physicians' information on patients' choice behavior. From the neural level, an explanation for the results was that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and ventral striatum (VS) brain regions, two key brain regions reflecting individual cognitive resource allocation, had different activation levels under different health involvement, indicating that patients allocated different cognitive resources.",0
Development of an exercise therapy referral clinical support tool for patients with osteoporosis at risk for falls.,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to develop a clinical support tool for osteoporosis clinic providers to support risk assessment and referrals for evidence-based exercise therapy programs. METHODS: A sequential Delphi method was used with a multidisciplinary group of national falls experts, to provide consensus on referral to exercise therapy for patients at risk for falls. The Delphi study included a primary research team, expert panel, and clinical partners to answer the questions: (1) ""What patient characteristics are needed to develop a clinical support tool?""; (2) ""What are the recommended exercise referrals for patients with osteoporosis at risk for falls?"" The consensus process consisted of two rounds with 8 weeks between meetings. Two qualitative researchers analyzed the data using a modified version of a matrix analysis approach. RESULTS: The following were the most important variables to include when determining exercise therapy referrals for patients with osteoporosis: Patient history and demographics, falls history over the last year, current physical function and balance, caregiver and transportation status, socioeconomic and insurance status, and patient preference. Potential exercise therapy referrals included one-on-one physical therapy, group physical therapy, home health, community-based exercise programs, and not acceptable for exercise therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patient characteristics including patient history, physical function and balance performance, socioeconomic and insurance status, and patient preference for exercise therapy are important to inform both the medical provider and patient with osteoporosis to choose the most appropriate exercise therapy referral. Adoption of the algorithmic suggestions may have a significant impact on uptake and adherence to exercise therapy, ultimately improving patient physical function and reducing falls risk.",0
Tiered Physician Network Plans and Patient Choices of Specialist Physicians.,"IMPORTANCE: Tiered physician network (TPN) health plans sort physicians into tiers based on their cost and quality, and patients pay lower copays for visits with physicians in the lower-cost and better-quality tiers. When the plans are first introduced, they lead patients to seek care from higher-value physicians. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether TPNs are associated with patient choice of physician when the plans have been in place for 8 to 12 years and whether there are inequities in patient out-of-pocket costs associated with inequities in access to physicians in lower-copay tiers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study comprising 46 645 physicians and 585 399 patients in TPNs, including 54 683 patients who had a new patient visit with a physician in a TPN, used health insurance claims data from a large employer purchaser from July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2019. Statistical analysis was performed from November 2020 to August 2023. EXPOSURE: Evaluation and management visit with a physician in a TPN. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Main outcomes were new patient market share per physician-carrier-zip code-year, distance from centroid of patient zip code to centroid of zip code of nearest low- or medium-copay physician, and mean TPN physician office visit copay per patient. A regression discontinuity design was used to estimate the association of a physician's tier ranking, and a difference-in-differences analysis was used to estimate the association of copayment differences across tiers with market share among new patients. Equity in access was measured by comparing travel distance to the nearest physician in a low-copay or medium-copay tier and mean copayments across patient incomes. RESULTS: The main analysis sample included 46 645 physician-carrier-zip code-year observations, 9506 (20.4%) of which were in the low-copay tier, 31 798 (68.2%) in the medium-copay tier, and 5341 (11.5%) in the high-copay tier. The 54 683 new patients in the sample had a mean (SD) age of 46.4 (16.7) years and included 33 542 women (61.3%). There was no association of having a worse tier ranking (0.045 percentage points [95% CI, -0.058 to 0.148 percentage points]) or of copayment differences between tiers (0.001 percentage points [95% CI, -0.002 to 0.004 percentage points]) with physician market share among new patients. The patients with the lowest income paid slightly lower mean (SD) copayments for office visits to a TPN physician than the patients with high income ($48.08 [$16.42] vs $51.59 [$16.79], a 6.8% difference). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study of TPN health plans, there was no association between physician tier ranking and physician market share among any group of patients. These findings suggest there are limitations in TPNs' steering of patients toward high-value physicians. These plans were not associated with exacerbated health inequity in this setting.",0
Analysis of Barriers to Public and Private Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs in Patients with Low and High Adherence.,"INTRODUCTION: Participants in cardiac rehabilitation programs have low adherence to their sessions, which makes extremely important to recognize the barriers that cause non-adherence, identifying whether the type of service and level of adherence influence these barriers. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study, in which 220 individuals (66.80±11.59 years) of both genders who are members of public and private exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs participated. The volunteers were divided according to the level of adherence, considering patients with low adherence (PLA) those with < 70% of attendance and high adherence (PHA) those with > 70%. Then, initial evaluation, Cardiac Rehabilitation Barriers Scale, analysis of socioeconomic level, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Mini-Mental State Examination were applied. RESULTS: Higher total barriers were found in PLA in the public service compared to PHA in the private service (P=0.023). In the subscale ""perceived need"", PHA in the public service showed higher values than PLA and PHA in the private service (P≤0.001). The ""access"" barrier was higher for PHA in the public service when compared to PHA in the private service (P=0.024). PHA in the public service exhibited a higher barrier regarding questions about distance, transportation problems, cost, and time constraints. CONCLUSION: The public program presents higher barriers in the questions and categories compared to the private program, mainly the PHA. Furthermore, there are differences in the profile of the participants regarding socioeconomic and anxiety levels, treatment time, ethnicity, and city where they live.",0
Evaluation of a Clinic-Based Exercise Program in Patients with Pancreatic Cancer Undergoing Nonsurgical Treatment.,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence regarding the role of exercise in pancreatic cancer (PanCa) is limited and is derived exclusively under tightly controlled research conditions. This study aimed to quantify adherence, adverse events, and changes in physical and psychological outcomes in any patients with PanCa referred to undertake exercise during nonsurgical treatment. METHODS: The study involved 22 patients with localized or metastatic PanCa undertaking a clinic-based exercise program during chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. The program included supervised aerobic and resistance exercise undertaken twice weekly for 12 wk and a 12-wk follow-up with supervised exercise optional dependent on patient preference and condition. Patients were monitored for adherence and adverse events. Objective and patient-reported outcomes were assessed at baseline, 12 wk, and 24 wk. RESULTS: A total of 251 sessions were attended by 19 patients over the first 12 wk (attendance rate, 55%). Complete case analyses indicated significant ( P < 0.05) improvements in functional ability (5.2%-17.2%), muscle strength (16.9%-25.1%), and static balance (6.8%). There were no significant changes in body composition or patient-reported outcomes except for sleep quality, which deteriorated; however, at an individual level, several patients had clinically relevant improvements in cancer-related fatigue and quality of life. Patients who continued with supervised exercise to week 24 largely preserved improvements in functional ability, muscle strength, and static balance. No serious adverse events resulted from the exercise program. CONCLUSIONS: Individualized, supervised aerobic and resistance exercise in a clinic-based setting appears to be safe and may improve or maintain physical and psychological health in patients with PanCa undergoing nonsurgical treatment.",0
Translation and validation of the Sindhi version of the general medication adherence scale in patients with chronic diseases.,"Background: There is no medication adherence scale available in Sindhi language currently. Hence, the Sindhi speaking population will either use a translator or provide their medical history in another language for documentation of medical conditions. This poses a challenge in monitoring and evaluating adherence to medications within this linguistic community. Aim: The aim of this study was to translate and validate the Sindhi version of the General Medication Adherence Scale (GMAS-S) in patients with chronic diseases. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 4 months duration and was conducted in out-patient department of a university affiliated hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. All adults with chronic diseases, who were on long-term medications, and able to read and understand Sindhi language were invited. Convenience sampling was employed and a questionnaire consisting of demographic questions and the Sindhi version of GMAS was used. The translation of the scale was carried out. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted, and a structural equation model (SEM) was developed. Fit indices, namely, goodness of fit index (GFI), adjusted goodness of fit index (AGFI), Tucker Lewis index (TLI), comparative fit index (CFI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) were reported. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha (α), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), corrected item-to-total correlation (ITC) and item deletion. Data were analysed through IBM SPSS version 23 and IBM AMOS version 25. The study obtained ethical clearance. Results: A total of 150 responses were analysed. The reliability of the Sindhi version of GMAS was (α) = 0.696. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was reported at 0.696 (95% CI: 0.618-0.763). The values for the fit indices were as follows: χ(2)/df = 1.84, GFI = 0.918, TLI = 0.920, CFI = 0.942, AGFI = 0.864, and RMSEA = 0.075. All values except AGFI were in the acceptable ranges and indicated good fitness. Most participants (80.7%) appeared non-adherent to their medications. Conclusion: The results of the study demonstrate that the Sindhi version of the GMAS is a valid and reliable scale to measure adherence in Sindhi speaking persons with chronic diseases.",0
Multidisciplinary consensus document on the current treatment of bacille Calmette-Guérin-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder tumor.,"Radical cystectomy is the current treatment of choice for patients with BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder tumor (NMIBC). However, the high comorbidity of this surgery and its effects on the quality of life of patients require the investigation and implementation of bladder-sparing treatment options. These must be evaluated individually by the uro-oncology committee based on the characteristics of the BCG failure, type of tumor, patient preferences and treatment options available in each center. Based on FDA-required oncologic outcomes (6-month complete response rate for CIS: 50%; duration of response in responders for CIS and papillary: 30% at 12 months and 25% at 18 months), there is not currently a strong preference for one treatment over another, although the intravesical route seems to offer less toxicity. This work summarizes the evidence on the management of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC based on current scientific evidence and provides consensus recommendations on the most appropriate treatment.",0
Understanding the Patient's Perspective on Nursing Excellence: Insights From Patient Experience Data.,"This performance improvement project leverages patient experience data to better understand patient preferences and values with respect to care from nurses. Through the analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data collected in patient experience surveys, the authors explore the concept of nursing excellence from the patient's perspective and discuss practical approaches, based on the Compassionate Connected Care model, to achieve desired improvement goals for nursing.",0
"Birth plans: definitions, content, effects, and best practices.","The first written guide for birth plans was introduced in 1980 as a means for birthing people to document their choices in the child birthing experience. The birth plan offers an opportunity for the patient and the provider to discuss the birthing process and determine how to safely accommodate patient preferences. Patient satisfaction with birthing plans is variable and may depend on how many requests they have, how many of their plans are accomplished, route of delivery, and whether complications arise during or after delivery. Unmet expectations may lead to posttraumatic stress disorder, but following a birth plan may also be protective against it. Birthing people who use a birth plan may be less likely to use epidural anesthesia, have early amniotomy, or use oxytocin. The first stage of labor may be longer when a birth plan is used; however, there does not seem to be a decrease in the length of the second stage of labor among patients with a birth plan. Some providers believe that a disadvantage of birth plans is disappointment when birth plans are not able to be followed, and others consider that birth plans interfere with professional autonomy.",0
Variation in Hospital Neuraxial Labor Analgesia Rates in California.,"BACKGROUND: Neuraxial analgesia provides effective pain relief during labor. However, it is unclear whether neuraxial analgesia prevalence differs across US hospitals. Our aim was to assess hospital variation in neuraxial analgesia prevalence in California. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed birthing patients who underwent labor in 200 California hospitals from 2016 to 2020. The primary exposure was the delivery hospital. The outcomes were hospital neuraxial analgesia prevalence and between-hospital variability, before and after adjustment for patient and hospital factors. Median odds ratio and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) quantified between-hospital variability. The median odds ratio estimated the odds of a patient receiving neuraxial analgesia when moving between hospitals. The ICC quantified the proportion of the total variance in neuraxial analgesia use due to variation between hospitals. RESULTS: Among 1,510,750 patients who underwent labor, 1,040, 483 (68.9%) received neuraxial analgesia. Both unadjusted and adjusted hospital prevalence exhibited a skewed distribution characterized by a long-left tail. The unadjusted and adjusted prevalence at the 1 st percentile were 5.4% and 6.0%; 5 th percentile were 21.0% and 21.2%; 50 th percentile were 70.6% and 70.7%; 95 th percentile were 75.8% and 76.6%; and 99 th percentile were 75.9% and 78.6%. The adjusted median odds ratio (2.3; 95% CI, 2.1 - 2.5) indicated a substantially increased odds of a patient receiving neuraxial analgesia if they moved from a hospital with a lower to higher odds of neuraxial analgesia. The hospital explained only a moderate portion of the overall variability in neuraxial analgesia (ICC=19.1%; 95% CI, 18.8 - 20.5%). CONCLUSIONS: A long left tail in the distribution and wide variation exist in the neuraxial analgesia prevalence across California hospitals, not explained by patient and hospital factors. Addressing the low prevalence among hospitals in the left tail requires exploration of the interplay between patient preferences, staffing availability, and care providers' attitudes towards neuraxial analgesia.",0
Preferences for Enhanced Primary Care Services Among Older Individuals and Primary Care Physicians.,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the factors that are most important for community-dwelling older individuals (i.e., users) and primary care (PC) providers to enhance PC services. METHODS: Discrete choice experiment surveys were administered to 747 individuals aged ≥ 60 years and 242 PC physicians in Singapore between December 2020 and August 2021. Participants were asked to choose between two hypothetical PC clinics and their current clinic. Latent class models were used to estimate the relative attribute importance (RAI) and to calculate the predicted uptake for enhanced PC services. RESULTS: Based on the attributes and levels used in this study, the out-of-pocket cost (RAI: 47%) and types of services offered (RAI: 25%) were the most important attributes for users while working hours (RAI: 28%) and patient load (RAI: 25%) were the most important for providers. For out-of-pocket visit costs ranging from Singapore dollars (S)$100 to S$5, users' predicted uptake for enhanced PC services ranged from 46 to 84%. For daily patient loads ranging from 60 to 20 patients, providers' predicted uptake ranged from 64 to 91%, assuming their income remains unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides timely insights for the development of strategies to support the government's new health care initiative (HealthierSG), which places PC at the center of Singapore's healthcare system. The ability to choose their preferred clinic, low out-of-pocket costs and types of services offered (for users), and reasonable working conditions (for providers) were the key factors for users and providers to participate in enhanced PC services.",1
Unilateral Hyperpigmented Facial Lesion Since Birth.,"Facial hyperpigmented lesions that are unilateral are a rare and challenging dermatological anomaly since birth which can be genetic and non-genetic. This paper seeks to provide an exhaustive overview of the etiology, clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and management strategies for these congenital lesions. Unilateral facial hyperpigmented lesions can be caused by a number of conditions, such as congenital melanocytic nevi, Becker's nevus, nevus of Ota, linear epidermal nevi, and café-au-lait macules. Accurate diagnosis requires meticulous examination, dermoscopy, and histopathological evaluation. Observation, topical therapies, surgical excision, and laser therapy are among the available treatment options. Treatment decisions should be influenced by factors such as lesion characteristics, aesthetic concerns, and patient preferences. Long-term supervision and psychosocial support are indispensable elements of comprehensive management. We present a case of a 12-year-old patient with a progressively growing hyperpigmented lesion on the right side of the face, present since birth with an intermittent area of normal skin in between. Dermoscopy unveiled an irregular, dark brown pigment network, and histopathological evaluation showed an increased number of melanocytes in the dermis. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of such lesions and underscores the significance of a multidisciplinary approach for accurate evaluation and management. This paper aims to cover existing knowledge gaps regarding unilateral facial hyperpigmented lesions since birth and direct future research efforts for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.",0
Economic evaluations of assisted reproductive technologies in high-income countries: a systematic review.,"STUDY QUESTION: Which assited reproductive technology (ART) interventions in high-income countries are cost-effective and which are not? SUMMARY ANSWER: Among all ART interventions assessed in economic evaluations, most high-cost interventions, including preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) for a general population and ICSI for unexplained infertility, are unlikely to be cost-effective owing to minimal or no increase in effectiveness. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Approaches to reduce costs in order to increase access have been identified as a research priority for future infertility research. There has been an increasing number of ART interventions implemented in routine clinical practice globally, before robust assessments of evidence on economic evaluations. The extent of clinical effectiveness of some studied comparisons has been evaluated in high-quality research, allowing more informative decision making around cost-effectiveness. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We performed a systematic review and searched seven databases (MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, COCHRANE, ECONLIT, SCOPUS, and CINAHL) for studies examining ART interventions for infertility together with an economic evaluation component (cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit, cost-utility, or cost-minimization assessment), in high-income countries, published since January 2011. The last search was 22 June 2022. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Two independent reviewers assessed publications and included those fulfilling the eligibility criteria. Studies were examined to assess the cost-effectiveness of the studied intervention, as well as the reporting quality of the study. The chosen outcome measure and payer perspective were also noted. Completeness of reporting was assessed against the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standard. Results are presented and summarized based on the intervention studied. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The review included 40 studies which were conducted in 11 high-income countries. Most studies (n = 34) included a cost-effectiveness analysis. ART interventions included medication or strategies for controlled ovarian stimulation (n = 15), IVF (n = 9), PGT-A (n = 7), single embryo transfer (n = 5), ICSI (n = 3), and freeze-all embryo transfer (n = 1). Live birth was the mostly commonly reported primary outcome (n = 27), and quality-adjusted life years was reported in three studies. The health funder perspective was used in 85% (n = 34) of studies. None of the included studies measured patient preference for treatment. It remains uncertain whether PGT-A improves pregnancy rates compared to IVF cycles managed without PGT-A, and therefore cost-effectiveness could not be demonstrated for this intervention. Similarly, ICSI in non-male factor infertility appears not to be clinically effective compared to standard fertilization in an IVF cycle and is therefore not cost-effective. Interventions such as use of biosimilars or HMG for ovarian stimulation are cheaper but compromise clinical effectiveness. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Lack of both preference-based and standardized outcomes limits the comparability of results across studies. The selection of efficacy evidence offered for some interventions for economic evaluations is not always based on high-quality randomized trials and systematic reviews. In addition, there is insufficient knowledge of the willingness to pay thresholds of individuals and state funders for treatment of infertility. There is variable quality of reporting scores, which might increase uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness results. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Investment in strategies to help infertile people who utilize ART is justifiable at both personal and population levels. This systematic review may assist ART funders decide how to best invest to maximize the likelihood of delivery of a healthy child. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): There was no funding for this study.

Efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis: update for the practising clinician.,"Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, including tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib and filgotinib, are increasingly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There has been debate about their safety, particularly following the issuance of guidance by regulatory agencies advising caution in their use in certain patients. The registrational clinical trials and registry data of JAK inhibitors did not identify a difference in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), venous thromboembolism, malignancies or infections (other than herpes zoster) with a JAK inhibitor versus a biologic DMARD. In the ORAL Surveillance trial, which enrolled patients >50 years of age with ≥1 cardiovascular risk factor, tofacitinib was statistically inferior to TNF inhibitors for the occurrence of MACEs and malignancy. Further post hoc analysis of the data revealed that an age of ≥65 years, a high baseline cardiovascular risk, a history of smoking, sustained inflammation, disease activity and suboptimal treatment of cardiovascular comorbidities all increase the risk of these outcomes. The guidance issued by regulatory agencies should be carefully considered to ensure appropriate and safe treatment of patients with RA without undertreatment of patients who might benefit from JAK inhibitor, as well as biologic, treatment. As always, the risks associated with the use of these agents, treatment goals, costs and patient preferences should be discussed with the patient.",0
Management of patients with advanced prostate cancer-metastatic and/or castration-resistant prostate cancer: Report of the Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) 2022.,"BACKGROUND: Innovations in imaging and molecular characterisation together with novel treatment options have improved outcomes in advanced prostate cancer. However, we still lack high-level evidence in many areas relevant to making management decisions in daily clinical practise. The 2022 Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC 2022) addressed some questions in these areas to supplement guidelines that mostly are based on level 1 evidence. OBJECTIVE: To present the voting results of the APCCC 2022. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The experts voted on controversial questions where high-level evidence is mostly lacking: locally advanced prostate cancer; biochemical recurrence after local treatment; metastatic hormone-sensitive, non-metastatic, and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; oligometastatic prostate cancer; and managing side effects of hormonal therapy. A panel of 105 international prostate cancer experts voted on the consensus questions. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The panel voted on 198 pre-defined questions, which were developed by 117 voting and non-voting panel members prior to the conference following a modified Delphi process. A total of 116 questions on metastatic and/or castration-resistant prostate cancer are discussed in this manuscript. In 2022, the voting was done by a web-based survey because of COVID-19 restrictions. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The voting reflects the expert opinion of these panellists and did not incorporate a standard literature review or formal meta-analysis. The answer options for the consensus questions received varying degrees of support from panellists, as reflected in this article and the detailed voting results are reported in the supplementary material. We report here on topics in metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC), non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and oligometastatic and oligoprogressive prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These voting results in four specific areas from a panel of experts in advanced prostate cancer can help clinicians and patients navigate controversial areas of management for which high-level evidence is scant or conflicting and can help research funders and policy makers identify information gaps and consider what areas to explore further. However, diagnostic and treatment decisions always have to be individualised based on patient characteristics, including the extent and location of disease, prior treatment(s), co-morbidities, patient preferences, and treatment recommendations and should also incorporate current and emerging clinical evidence and logistic and economic factors. Enrolment in clinical trials is strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2022 once again identified important gaps where there is non-consensus and that merit evaluation in specifically designed trials. PATIENT SUMMARY: The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) provides a forum to discuss and debate current diagnostic and treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The conference aims to share the knowledge of international experts in prostate cancer with healthcare providers worldwide. At each APCCC, an expert panel votes on pre-defined questions that target the most clinically relevant areas of advanced prostate cancer treatment for which there are gaps in knowledge. The results of the voting provide a practical guide to help clinicians discuss therapeutic options with patients and their relatives as part of shared and multidisciplinary decision-making. This report focuses on the advanced setting, covering metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and both non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. TWITTER SUMMARY: Report of the results of APCCC 2022 for the following topics: mHSPC, nmCRPC, mCRPC, and oligometastatic prostate cancer. TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: At APCCC 2022, clinically important questions in the management of advanced prostate cancer management were identified and discussed, and experts voted on pre-defined consensus questions. The report of the results for metastatic and/or castration-resistant prostate cancer is summarised here.",0
Development of an Interactive Tool to Support Shared Decision-Making in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Treatment Attribute Preference.,"OBJECTIVE: An interactive tool identifying treatment attributes important to patients can enhance shared decision-making (SDM) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A formative survey was conducted to identify the most important treatment attributes from patients' perspective, which can be used to develop an interactive SDM tool. METHODS: The survey was performed in two phases: qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys. The qualitative interviews were conducted to inform the design of the quantitative survey. In qualitative interviews, patients with RA (n = 10) and rheumatologists (n = 10) were introduced to the SDM tool concept. Feedback on the design and scope of the SDM tool was used to develop a quantitative survey, conducted in a large sample size of patients. Patient preferences for treatment attributes (route of administration and dosing frequency, serious side effects, out-of-pocket costs, efficacy, and monitoring requirement) were assessed via adaptive conjoint exercise involving ranking of hypothetical RA treatment configurations. RESULTS: A total of 944 patients (males: 43%, females: 57%) with RA participated in the quantitative survey. Route of administration and dosing frequency (38%) followed by serious side effects (33%) were the two most important treatment attributes for individual patients. The recontact survey (n = 172/944) estimated tool stability of 72% (n = 124/172) in terms of the relative importance of treatment attributes. CONCLUSION: The findings of this survey could be used in the development of an SDM tool that can potentially provide insights into patient preferences and is generally well received by patients and rheumatologists with good agreement and reliability.",1
Patient Comfort with Before and After Photography at Plastic Surgery Offices.,"BACKGROUND: Before and after (B&A) photographs are a sensitive part of patients' medical records, and the use of smartphones may pose risks to confidentiality and comfort. The purpose of this study was to assess patient comfort depending on the circumstances under which these photographs being taken. METHODS: Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing service and REDCap's survey manager were used to recruit survey participants. An anonymous survey was distributed to ascertain demographics and comfort in various B&A scenarios using a five-point Likert scale. T tests and ANOVA testing were used to compare groups. RESULTS: There were 411 respondents with an average age of 36.1 years old. Of them, 46% were female and the majority were White (90%) and non-Hispanic (64%). Nearly one-third had previously undergone plastic surgery, with 80% receiving B&A photography. Surgeons took these photographs 51% of the time with similar rates of smartphone cameras use (47%) versus professional cameras (52%). The public had similar levels of comfort when a nurse or a surgeon took the clinical photographs (p = 0.08). Patients were significantly less comfortable when non-medically trained office staff captured their photographs (p = 0.0041). The public had similar comfort levels with the use of smartphones and professional cameras when dressed but were significantly less comfortable with the use of a smartphone when unclothed (p = < 0.001). CONCLUSION: To ensure the best patient experience, B&A photography should be taken by a medical professional. If photographs are to be taken when the patient is unclothed, the use of a professional-grade camera may help ease patient discomfort.

Shared Decision-Making in Cardiovascular Practice.,"Clinical decisions are optimally made collaboratively, with patients and clinicians working together to review all available information and treatment options. A comprehensive dialogue that identifies and brings into focus individual patient goals within the context of the evidence base is the ideal approach. Shared decision-making (SDM) is essential to making choices about treatment preferences and characterizes the optimal practice of evidence-based medicine and good patient care. By supporting patient autonomy and engagement, the patient and family become partners in their health care. Decisions surrounding whether or not to proceed with diagnostic and therapeutic procedures after fully discussing appropriate alternatives are best made considering both the evidence base and patient goals. The central feature of SDM is that a clinician and a patient engage in a dialogue to jointly make decisions, with reciprocated sharing of information that both find beneficial to reach the best decision. SDM entails much more than patient education or informed consent: there must be bidirectional transfer of knowledge, discussion of patient preference, and a process of deliberation reaching consensus. Patient decision aids have been shown to improve patient understanding of options and risks, enhance the patient's involvement, and focus their comprehension of treatment preferences. Patient decision aids also may be of value in strengthening the physician-patient relationship. The need to emphasize SDM should be integrated into the quality process at every level to make it meaningful, not an apparently arbitrary obstacle that requires discovery of a shrewd work-around. A more patient-oriented consideration of the benefits of symptom relief and improved quality of life, in addition to survival and freedom from adverse events, could only be beneficial.",0
Acceptability of 'as needed' biologic therapy in psoriasis: insights from a multi-stakeholder mixed methods study.,"OBJECTIVES: Biologic therapies have led to increasing numbers of patients with psoriasis who have clear or nearly clear skin. Current practice is that biologic therapy is continued indefinitely in these patients, contributing to a substantial long-term drug and healthcare burden. 'As needed' biologic therapy in psoriasis may address this, however our understanding of patient and clinician perceptions of this strategy is limited. METHODS: We first conducted UK-wide online scoping surveys of patients with psoriasis and dermatology clinicians to explore their views on 'as needed' biologic therapy. Using topic guides informed by these survey findings, we then carried out qualitative focus groups with patients and clinicians. Themes were identified using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Of 67 patients and 27 clinicians completing the scoping surveys, 67% (43/64) and 78% (21/27), respectively, supported the use of 'as needed' biologic therapy. Respondents highlighted advantages such as a reduction in healthcare burden and greater ownership of care. Challenges included logistics of 'as needed' drug provision and potential risks of disease flare and drug immunogenicity. Focus groups comprised 15 patients with psoriasis (9 female [60%], average disease duration 32 years [range 9-64 years]) and 9 dermatology clinicians (8 female [89%], average dermatology experience 20 years [range 8-33 years]). Both patients and clinicians felt that an 'as needed' treatment approach will deliver a reduction in treatment burden and present an opportunity for patient-led ownership of care. Both groups highlighted the importance of ensuring ongoing access to medication and discussing the potential impact of psoriasis recurrence. Patient preferences were influenced by their lived experiences, particularly previous difficulties with medication delivery logistics and establishing disease control. Clinician perspectives were informed by personal experience of their patients adapting their own dosing schedules. Clinicians highlighted the importance of targeted patient selection for an 'as needed' approach, ongoing disease monitoring, and prompt re-access to medications upon psoriasis recurrence. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that 'as needed' biologic therapy in psoriasis is acceptable for both patients and clinicians. Formal assessment of clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness is warranted, to enable the real-world potential of this approach to be realised.",0
Patients' preferences for fracture risk communication: the Risk Communication in Osteoporosis (RICO) study.,"The RICO study indicated that most patients would like to receive information regarding their fracture risk but that only a small majority have actually received it. Patients globally preferred a visual presentation of fracture risk and were interested in an online tool showing the risk. PURPOSE: The aim of the Risk Communication in Osteoporosis (RICO) study was to assess patients' preferences regarding fracture risk communication. METHODS: To assess patients' preferences for fracture risk communication, structured interviews with women with osteoporosis or who were at risk for fracture were conducted in 11 sites around the world, namely in Argentina, Belgium, Canada at Hamilton and with participants from the Osteoporosis Canada Canadian Osteoporosis Patient Network (COPN), Japan, Mexico, Spain, the Netherlands, the UK, and the USA in California and Washington state. The interviews used to collect data were designed on the basis of a systematic review and a qualitative pilot study involving 26 participants at risk of fracture. RESULTS: A total of 332 women (mean age 67.5 ± 8.0 years, 48% with a history of fracture) were included in the study. Although the participants considered it important to receive information about their fracture risk (mean importance of 6.2 ± 1.4 on a 7-point Likert scale), only 56% (i.e. 185/332) had already received such information. Globally, participants preferred a visual presentation with a traffic-light type of coloured graph of their FRAX® fracture risk probability, compared to a verbal or written presentation. Almost all participants considered it important to discuss their fracture risk and the consequences of fractures with their healthcare professionals in addition to receiving information in a printed format or access to an online website showing their fracture risk. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant communication gap between healthcare professionals and patients when discussing osteoporosis fracture risk. The RICO study provides insight into preferred approaches to rectify this communication gap.",0
Patient Preferences for Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) Screening Tests.,"BACKGROUND: Emerging blood-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests can detect a variety of cancer types across stages with a range of sensitivity, specificity, and ability to predict the origin of the cancer signal. However, little is known about the general US population's preferences for MCED tests. OBJECTIVE: To quantify preferences for MCED tests among US adults aged 50-80 years using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). METHODS: To quantify preferences for attributes of blood-based MCED tests, an online DCE was conducted with five attributes (true positives, false negatives, false positives, likelihood of the cancer type unknown, number of cancer types detected), among the US population aged 50-80 years recruited via online panels and social media. Data were analyzed using latent class multinomial logit models and relative attribute importance was obtained. RESULTS: Participants (N = 1700) were 54% female, mean age 63.3 years. Latent class modeling identified three classes with distinct preferences for MCED tests. The rank order of attribute importance based on relative attribute importance varied by latent class, but across all latent classes, participants preferred higher accuracy (fewer false negatives and false positives, more true positives) and screenings that detected more cancer types and had a lower likelihood of cancer type unknown. Overall, 72% of participants preferred to receive an MCED test in addition to currently recommended cancer screenings. CONCLUSIONS: While there is significant heterogeneity in cancer screening preferences, the majority of participants preferred MCED screening and the accuracy of these tests is important. While the majority of participants preferred adding an MCED test to complement current cancer screenings, the latent class analyses identified a small (16%) and specific subset of individuals who value attributes differently, with particular concern regarding false-negative and false-positive test results, who are significantly less likely to opt-in.",1
"""I'd rather wait and see what's around the corner"": A multi-perspective qualitative study of treatment escalation planning in frailty.","INTRODUCTION: People living with frailty risk adverse outcomes following even minor illnesses. Admission to hospital or the intensive care unit is associated with potentially burdensome interventions and poor outcomes. Decision-making during an emergency is fraught with complexity and potential for conflict between patients, carers and clinicians. Advance care planning is a process of shared decision-making which aims to ensure patients are treated in line with their wishes. However, planning for future care is challenging and those living with frailty are rarely given the opportunity to discuss their preferences. The aim of the ProsPECT (Prospective Planning for Escalation of Care and Treatment) study was to explore perspectives on planning for treatment escalation in the context of frailty. We spoke to people living with frailty, their carers and clinicians across primary and secondary care. METHODS: In-depth online or telephone interviews and online focus groups. The topic guide explored frailty, acute decision-making and planning for the future. Data were thematically analysed using the Framework Method. Preliminary findings were presented to a sample of study participants for feedback in two online workshops. RESULTS: We spoke to 44 participants (9 patients, 11 carers and 24 clinicians). Four main themes were identified: frailty is absent from treatment escalation discussions, planning for an uncertain future, escalation in an acute crisis is 'the path of least resistance', and approaches to facilitating treatment escalation planning in frailty. CONCLUSION: Barriers to treatment escalation planning include a lack of shared understanding of frailty and uncertainty about the future. Emergency decision-making is focussed on survival or risk aversion and patient preferences are rarely considered. To improve planning discussions, we recommend frailty training for non-specialist clinicians, multi-disciplinary support, collaborative working between patients, carers and clinicians as well as broader public engagement.",0
Transcatheter or Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis and Small Aortic Annulus: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment in patients with severe aortic stenosis and small aortic annulus (SAA) remains to be determined. This study aimed to compare the hemodynamic and clinical outcomes between transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with a SAA. METHODS: This prospective multicenter international randomized trial was performed in 15 university hospitals. Participants were 151 patients with severe aortic stenosis and SAA (mean diameter <23 mm) randomized (1:1) to TAVR (n=77) versus SAVR (n=74). The primary outcome was impaired valve hemodynamics (ie, severe prosthesis patient mismatch or moderate-severe aortic regurgitation) at 60 days as evaluated by Doppler echocardiography and analyzed in a central echocardiography core laboratory. Clinical events were secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 75.5±5.1 years, with 140 (93%) women, a median Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality of 2.50% (interquartile range, 1.67%-3.28%), and a median annulus diameter of 21.1 mm (interquartile range, 20.4-22.0 mm). There were no differences between groups in the rate of severe prosthesis patient mismatch (TAVR, 4 [5.6%]; SAVR, 7 [10.3%]; P=0.30) and moderate-severe aortic regurgitation (none in both groups). No differences were found between groups in mortality rate (TAVR, 1 [1.3%]; SAVR, 1 [1.4%]; P=1.00) and stroke (TAVR, 0; SAVR, 2 [2.7%]; P=0.24) at 30 days. After a median follow-up of 2 (interquartile range, 1-4) years, there were no differences between groups in mortality rate (TAVR, 7 [9.1%]; SAVR, 6 [8.1%]; P=0.89), stroke (TAVR, 3 [3.9%]; SAVR, 3 [4.1%]; P=0.95), and cardiac hospitalization (TAVR, 15 [19.5%]; SAVR, 15 [20.3%]; P=0.80). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe aortic stenosis and SAA (women in the majority), there was no evidence of superiority of contemporary TAVR versus SAVR in valve hemodynamic results. After a median follow-up of 2 years, there were no differences in clinical outcomes between groups. These findings suggest that the 2 therapies represent a valid alternative for treating patients with severe aortic stenosis and SAA, and treatment selection should likely be individualized according to baseline characteristics, additional anatomical risk factors, and patient preference. However, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution because of the limited sample size leading to an underpowered study, and need to be confirmed in future larger studies.

TB preventive therapy preferences among children and adolescents.,"BACKGROUND: TB preventive therapy (TPT) is critical for ending TB, yet implementation remains poor. With new global guidelines expanding TPT eligibility and regimens, we aimed to understand TPT preferences among children, adolescents and caregivers.METHODS: We undertook a discrete choice experiment among 131 children, 170 adolescents and 173 caregivers, and conducted 17 in-depth interviews in 25 clinics in Cape Town, South Africa. The design included attributes for location, waiting time, treatment duration, dosing frequency, formulation/size, side effects, packaging and taste. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used for analysis.RESULTS: Among children and caregivers, the number and size of pills, taste and side effects were important drivers of preferences. Among adolescents and caregivers, clinic waiting times and side effects were significant drivers of preferences. Adolescents expressed concerns about being stigmatised, and preferred services from local clinics to services delivered in the community. Dosing frequency and treatment duration were only significant drivers of choice among adolescents, and only if linked to fewer clinic visits.CONCLUSIONS: Introducing shorter TPT regimens in isolation without consideration of preferences and health services may not have the desired effect on uptake and completion. Developing TPT delivery models and formulations that align with preferences must be prioritised.",1
Family Spillover Effects: Are Economic Evaluations Misrepresenting the Value of Healthcare Interventions to Society?,"The societal impacts of health interventions are seldom incorporated into health economic evaluations, including the impact that illness can have on informal or unpaid caregivers and other family members (i.e., ""family spillover effects""). Previous research has demonstrated that by excluding family spillover effects, the value of health interventions may be underestimated on average. In this commentary, we discuss how the inclusion of spillover effects influences how we value interventions and, given the extent to which caregiver/family effects are largely not captured or known, propose ways in which these data could be more systematically collected or estimated and used by researchers. These recommendations include prioritizing data collection alongside clinical trials and patient registries, engaging expert opinion panels, and developing mapping algorithms for estimating caregiver/family utility values from non-preference-based caregiver health-related quality-of-life measures and/or from patient preference-based measures.",0

"A Head-to-Head Comparison of Computed Tomography Colonography, Optical Colonoscopy, and Colon Endoscopic Capsule for the Detection of Polyps After Partial Colectomy or Rectosigmoidectomy for Colorectal Cancer: A Pilot Study.","Background and objective Optical colonoscopy is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) and it allows for biopsy and resection, as well as documentation of synchronous lesions. CT colonography (CTC) and colon endoscopic capsule (CEC) are also recommended as alternative minimally invasive or non-invasive procedures. Prospective studies comparing these three approaches are scarce in the current literature. In light of this, the aim of this pilot study was to compare the efficacy of polyp detection between these three methods in patients with a history of curative surgical resection of CRC. Methods Patients were consecutively recruited and all procedures were sequentially conducted on the same day. The primary endpoint was the detection rate of polyps, whereas secondary endpoints were the detection of polyps according to size and location, and the adverse events caused by these procedures. Results A total of 21 patients were consecutively included and all of them underwent all three interventions. No adverse events, local recurrences, or metachronous lesions were detected. In two cases with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CTC unveiled distant metastasis. Optical colonoscopy registered a mean of 0.4 polyp >6 mm and 1.3 polyps <6 mm per patient. CTC unveiled only 0.5 polyp >6 mm/patient and no smaller lesions were documented, whereas findings for the colon capsule comprised an average of 0.4 polyps >6 mm and 0.7 polyps <6 mm per patient. Statistical difference was not demonstrated, except for virtual colonoscopy in terms of the total number of polyps detected in comparison to optical colonoscopy. Conclusions Optical colonoscopy showed superior results in comparison to virtual colonoscopy while there was no statistical difference in comparison to colon capsule. Notwithstanding occasional difficulties, all three techniques were well tolerated. Hence, decisions concerning the use of each diagnostic method should be based on their availability, professional expertise, contraindications, and patient preferences.",0
What do patients want to know about surgery for low-risk thyroid cancer? A qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making about treatment for low-risk thyroid cancer requires patients and surgeons to work together to select treatment that best balances risks and expected outcomes with patient preferences and values. To participate, patients must be activated and ask questions. We aimed to characterize what topics patients prioritize during treatment decision-making. METHODS: We identified substantive questions by patients with low-risk (cT1-2, N0) thyroid cancer during audio-recorded consultations with 9 surgeons at 2 unique health care systems. Logistics questions were excluded. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify major themes among patients' questions and surgeon responses. RESULTS: Overall, 28 of 30 patients asked 253 substantive questions, with 2 patients not asking any substantive questions (median 8, range 0-25). Patients were 20 to 71 years old, mostly White (86.7%) and female (80.0%). The questions addressed extent of surgery, hormone supplementation, risk of cancer progression, radioactive iodine, and etiology of thyroid cancer. When patients probed for a recommendation regarding extent of surgery, surgeons often responded indirectly. When patients asked how surgery could impact quality of life, surgeons focused on oncologic benefits and surgical risk. Patients commonly asked about hormone supplementation and radioactive iodine. CONCLUSION: Patient questions focused on the decision regarding extent of surgery, quality of life, and nonsurgical aspects of thyroid cancer care. Surgeon responses do not consistently directly answer patients' questions but focus on the risks, benefits, and conduct of surgery itself. These findings suggest an opportunity to help surgeons with resources to improve shared decision-making by providing information that patients prioritize.",0
Dutch prostate cancer patients' views about exercise and experience with exercise advice: a national survey.,"PURPOSE: To support the development and implementation of exercise programming for people with prostate cancer (PC), we investigated their views on exercise. METHODS: Online survey with open recruitment. We collected data on clinical and sociodemographic variables, experiences with exercise advice, outcome expectations, and preferences. We explored determinants of (1) having been counselled about exercise and (2) preferring supervised exercise. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 171 patients (mean age = 70 years, SD = 6.5) from all PC treatment pathways. Sixty-three percent of the respondents reported never having been informed about the potential benefits of exercise. Forty-nine percent preferred exercise to be supervised. Respondents generally reported a positive attitude towards exercise. Seventy-four percent indicated barriers to exercising, including fatigue and lack of access to specific programmes. Outcome expectations were generally positive but moderately strong. Receiving hormonal therapy and younger age were significantly associated with having received exercise advice. Being insured and having higher fatigue levels contributed significantly to the preference for supervised exercise. CONCLUSION: Dutch people with PC report receiving insufficient effective exercise counselling. Yet, they are open to exercise and expect exercise to improve their health, although they experience various barriers that limit their ability to exercise. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: The moderate outcome expectations for exercise of people with PC and their limited recall of exercise counselling highlight the need for better integration of exercise in clinical pathways. The lack of access to specific programming limits the use of evidence-based exercise programmes for people with PC.",0
Hormone Therapy: Testosterone Replacement Therapy.,"Testosterone levels decrease as men age. When the testes fail to produce an adequate level of endogenous testosterone, men develop hypogonadism. Although the definition of a low testosterone level varies among guidelines, a serum total testosterone level of less than 300 to 350 ng/dL on two separate morning blood samples is considered a low level. To receive exogenous testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), patients should meet criteria for hypogonadism, which is defined as a low testosterone level and signs or symptoms of hypogonadism. Management discussions should be individualized to address patient needs and goals. Counseling before therapy should include shared decision-making regarding risks, benefits, and expectations. Numerous testosterone formulations are available, ranging from topical gels to intramuscular injections. The choice of formulation depends on factors such as cost and patient preference. Use of TRT is limited by contraindications, adverse effects, and a lack of long-term safety data. Patients receiving this therapy require close monitoring. For patients who wish to avoid use of exogenous hormones, are not candidates for TRT, or are unable to tolerate its adverse effects, several nonhormonal pharmacotherapies are available.",0
"Factors associated to patients' referral to public or private Covid-19 healthcare centers in Tabriz, Iran.","BACKGROUND: In Iran, tracking of patients and its associated data recording in private healthcare centers are poor, and thus a majority of patients suffering from Covid-19 are treated without any control on the isolation and quarantine processes. The present study aims to investigate the factors contributed to referral to private or public healthcare centers that provide Covid-19 care services. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2021 to January 2022 in Tabriz, Iran. We invited a total of 258 and 202Covid-19 patients from governmental and private healthcare centers, respectively, to participate in the study by convenient sampling method. Applying a self-administered questionnaire, we collected data on the reason of referring to the healthcare centers, patient's waiting time, quality of healthcare services received by the patients, patients' level of satisfaction, accessibility, insurance coverage, perceived severity of the disease, and the level of staff compliance from health protocols. Logistic regression model was used for data analysis by using SPSS-26 software. RESULTS: Adjusted for other variables, higher socio-economic status (AOR (Adjusted Odds Ratio) = 6.64), older age (AOR = 1.02), referral of friends and family members (AOR = 1.52), shorter waiting time (AOR = 1.02) and higher satisfaction (AOR = 1.02) were contributed to referral to private centers. Better accessibility (AOR = 0.98) and wider insurance coverage (AOR = 0.99) were also contributed to referral to governmental centers. CONCLUSION: Providing more appropriate insurance coverage by private healthcare centers, and promoting their level of accessibility seems to promote patients' referral to such centers. Moreover, establishing an accurate system for recording patients' information and follow up in private centers might promote the role of private healthcare centers in managing the overload of patients on healthcare system during such epidemics.",0
Agreement and Reliability of Patient-measured Postvoid Residual Bladder Volumes.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the reliability, agreement with provider measurement, and patient preferences regarding patient self-measurement of postvoid residual bladder volume (PVR). PVR measurement in the nonhealthcare setting is a valuable opportunity for remote monitoring of voiding dysfunction patients. We hypothesized that patient self-measurement of PVR using a smart-device portable ultrasound system with artificial intelligence would demonstrate high reliability, strong agreement with provider measurement, and be preferred over provider measurements. METHODS: Patients were enrolled during outpatient Urology visits. PVRs were measured in triplicate by providers using each of the following: an FDA-cleared (standard) bladder scanner, the portable ultrasound probe using ultrasound images (Butterfly US image mode), and the portable ultrasound probe using abstract images (Butterfly abstract mode). Subjects self-measured PVRs in triplicate using both imaging modes and reported their experiences via questionnaire. Reliability was assessed via intraclass correlation. Agreement between methods was assessed via Bland-Altman analyses using a clinically acceptable difference threshold of 50 mL. RESULTS: Fifty patients were enrolled. Intraclass correlations ranged from 0.95 to 0.98 for each method. 95% limits of agreement between standard bladder scanner and patient self-measurement were - 71.73 mL and 86.73 mL using Butterfly US image mode and - 93.84 mL and 112.52 mL using Butterfly abstract mode, respectively. Most patients preferred self-measurement over provider measurement (74% vs 26%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Patient self-measurement of PVR using smart-device integrated portable ultrasound probes is feasible, reliable, and preferred by patients. Limits of agreement between patient self-measurement and standard bladder scanner measurements exceeded our clinically acceptable difference threshold, though the inherent error of ultrasound-based bladder volume measurements should be considered. Longitudinal PVR assessments in nonhealthcare settings may facilitate remote monitoring of voiding dysfunction patients.",0
Assessment of the Massachusetts Flexible Services Program to Address Food and Housing Insecurity in a Medicaid Accountable Care Organization.,"IMPORTANCE: Health systems are increasingly addressing health-related social needs. The Massachusetts Flexible Services program (Flex) is a 3-year pilot program to address food insecurity and housing insecurity by connecting Medicaid accountable care organization (ACO) enrollees to community resources. OBJECTIVE: To understand barriers and facilitators of Flex implementation in 1 Medicaid ACO during the first 17 months of the program. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This mixed-methods qualitative evaluation study from March 2020 to July 2021 used the Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance/Practical, Robust Implementation, and Sustainability Model (RE-AIM/PRISM) framework. Two Mass General Brigham (MGB) hospitals and affiliated community health centers were included in the analysis. Quantitative data included all MGB Medicaid ACO enrollees. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 members of ACO staff and 17 Flex enrollees. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reach was assessed by the proportion of ACO enrollees who completed annual social needs screening (eg, food insecurity and housing insecurity) and the proportion and demographics of Flex enrollees. Qualitative interviews examined other RE-AIM/PRISM constructs (eg, implementation challenges, facilitators, and perceived effectiveness). RESULTS: Of 67 098 Medicaid ACO enrollees from March 2020 to July 2021 (mean [SD] age, 28.8 [18.7] years), 38 442 (57.3%) completed at least 1 social needs screening; 10 730 (16.0%) screened positive for food insecurity, and 7401 (11.0%) screened positive for housing insecurity. There were 658 (1.6%) adults (mean [SD] age, 46.6 [11.8] years) and 173 (0.7%) children (<21 years; mean [SD] age, 10.1 [5.5]) enrolled in Flex; of these 831 people, 613 (73.8%) were female, 444 (53.4%) were Hispanic/Latinx, and 172 (20.7%) were Black. Most Flex enrollees (584 [88.8%] adults; 143 [82.7%] children) received the intended nutrition or housing services. Implementation challenges identified by staff interviewed included administrative burden, coordination with community organizations, data-sharing and information-sharing, and COVID-19 factors (eg, reduced clinical visits). Implementation facilitators included administrative funding for enrollment staff, bidirectional communication with community partners, adaptive strategies to identify eligible patients, and raising clinician awareness of Flex. In Flex enrollee interviews, those receiving nutrition services reported increased healthy eating and food security; they also reported higher program satisfaction than Flex enrollees receiving housing services. Enrollees who received nutrition services that allowed for selecting food based on preferences reported higher satisfaction than those not able to select food. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This mixed-methods qualitative evaluation study found that to improve implementation, Medicaid and health system programs that address social needs may benefit from providing funding for administrative costs, developing bidirectional data-sharing platforms, and tailoring support to patient preferences.",0
Association of clinicopathologic variables and patient preference with the choice of surgical treatment for early-stage breast cancer: A registry-based study.,"INTRODUCTION: Observational studies suggest that breast conserving surgery (BCS) and radiotherapy (RT) offers superior survival compared to mastectomy. The aim was to compare patient and tumour characteristics in women with invasive breast cancer ≤30 mm treated with either BCS or mastectomy, and to explore the underlying reason for choosing mastectomy. METHODS: Women registered with breast cancer ≤30 mm and ≤4 positive axillary lymph nodes in the Swedish National Breast Cancer Register 2013-2016 were included. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association of tumour and patient characteristics with receiving a mastectomy vs. BCS. RESULTS: Of 1860 breast cancers in 1825 women, 1346 were treated by BCS and 514 by mastectomy. Adjuvant RT was given to 1309 women (97.1 %) after BCS and 146 (27.6 %) after mastectomy. Variables associated with receiving a mastectomy vs. BCS included clinical detection (Odds Ratio (OR) 4.15 (95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 3.35-5.14)) and clinical stage (T2 vs. T1 (OR 3.68 (95 % CI 2.90-4.68)), N1 vs. N0 (OR 2.02 (95 % CI 1.38-2.96)). Women receiving mastectomy more often had oestrogen receptor negative, HER2 positive tumours of higher histological grade. The most common reported reason for mastectomy was large or multifocal tumours (53.5 %), followed by patient preference (34.5 %). CONCLUSION: Choice of surgery is strongly associated with key prognostic factors among women undergoing BCS with RT compared to mastectomy. Failure to control for all relevant confounders may bias results in outcome studies in favour of BCS.",0
Patient preferences in the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain: a systematic review of discrete choice experiments.,"Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is a preference-sensitive condition for which numerous treatment options are available, each with benefits and risks. Thus, patient preferences play a critical role in decision making. This study summarized evidence from discrete choice experiments (DCEs) to quantify patient preferences for CMP treatment and identified important treatment attributes. A systematic review of DCEs on patient preferences for CMP treatment was conducted. Studies were included if they used DCE to determine patient preferences for CMP. A previously described methodological assessment tool was used to assess the risk of bias. The treatment attributes were summarized and sorted according to the frequency of citation and relative weight. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the intervention-specific attributes. A total of 15 eligible studies with 4065 participants were included. We identified ""capacity to realize daily life activities,"" ""risk of adverse events,"" ""effectiveness in pain reduction,"" and ""out-of-pocket cost"" as important attributes. Although ""treatment frequency"" and ""onset of treatment efficacy"" were less frequently mentioned, they were also important attributes. The attribute of ""risk of adverse events"" was especially important for drug treatment. The ""out-of-pocket cost"" and ""treatment location and mode"" were important attributes of exercise therapy. The attributes identified in this review will inform the design of future DCE studies, facilitate the translation of measurement-based care to value-based care, and provide the rationale to promote shared decision making and patient-centered care.",1
Anesthesia and postpartum pain management for placenta accreta spectrum: The healthcare provider perspective.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the management and experiences of healthcare providers around anesthetic care in placenta accreta spectrum (PAS). METHODS: This descriptive survey study was carried out over a 6-week period between January and March 2023. Healthcare providers, both anesthesiologists and those involved in operative care for women with PAS, were invited to participate. Questions invited both quantitative and qualitative responses. Qualitative responses were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: In all, 171 healthcare providers responded to the survey, the majority of whom were working in tertiary PAS referral centers (153; 89%) and 116 (70%) had more than 10 years of clinical experience. There was variation in the preferred primary mode of anesthesia for PAS cases; 69 (42%) used neuraxial only, but 58 (35%) used a combined approach of neuraxial and general anesthesia, with only 12 (8%) preferring general anesthesia. Ninety-nine (61%) were offering a routine antenatal anesthesia consultation. Content analysis of qualitative data identified three main themes, which were ""variation in approach to primary mode of anesthesia"", ""perspectives of patient preferences"", and ""importance of multidisciplinary team care"". These findings led to the development of a decision aid provided as part of this paper, which may assist clinicians in counseling women on their options for care to come to an informed decision. CONCLUSIONS: Approach to anesthesia for PAS varied between healthcare providers. The final decision for anesthesia should take into consideration the clinical care needs as well as the preferences of the patient.",0
Expected Health Benefits of SGLT-2 Inhibitors and GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Older Adults.,"Background. Older and sicker adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) were underrepresented in randomized trials of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor-agonist (GLP1RA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2I), and thus, health benefits are uncertain in this population. Objective. To assess the impact of age, health status, and life expectancy in older adults with T2D on health benefits of GLP1RA and SGLT2I. Design. We used the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) model to simulate lifetime health outcomes. We calibrated the UKPDS model to improve mortality prediction in older adults using a common geriatric prognostic index. Participants. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013-2018 participants 65 y and older with T2D, eligible for GLP1RA or SGLT2I according to American Diabetes Association guidelines. Interventions. GLP1RA or SGLT2I use versus no additional medication. Main Measures. Lifetime complications and weighted life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) across overall treatment arms and life expectancies. Key Results. The overall older adult population was predicted to experience significant health benefits from GLP1RA (+0.29 LY [95% confidence interval: 0.27, 0.31], +0.15 QALYs [0.14, 0.16]) and SGLT2I (+0.26 LY [0.24, 0.28], +0.13 QALYs [0.12, 0.14]) as compared with no added medication. However, expected benefits declined in subgroups with shorter life expectancies. Participants with <4 y of life expectancy had minimal gains of <0.05 LY and <0.03 QALYs from added medication. Accounting for injection-related disutility, GLP1RA use reduced QALYs (-0.03 QALYs [-0.04, -0.02]). Conclusions. While GLP1RA and SGLT2I have substantial health benefits for many older adults with type 2 diabetes, benefits are not clinically significant in patients with <4 y of life expectancy. Life expectancy and patient preferences are important considerations when prescribing newer diabetes medications. HIGHLIGHTS: On average, older adults benefit significantly from SGLT2I and GLP1RA use. However, the benefits of these drugs are not clinically significant among older patients with life expectancy less than 4 y.There is potential harm in injectable GLP1RA use in the oldest categories of adults with type 2 diabetes.Heterogeneity in life expectancy and patient preferences for injectable versus oral medications are important to consider when prescribing newer diabetes medications.",0
Approach to the Patient with Type 2 Diabetes Requiring Add-On Medication.,"In the last 20 years, the number of approved agents and agent classes for management of type 2 diabetes has expanded significantly. This more robust armamentarium affords us the opportunity to utilize drugs with complementary modes of action to address progressive hyperglycemia as insulin secretion declines over time. Furthermore, some of these agents provide additional benefits, such as weight loss, prevention of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), and protection against declining renal function. This dramatic increase of treatment options has led to complex published treatment advice which may be challenging for the busy clinician. A critical element in medication selection is awareness of the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) lowering potency of the agent being considered, and the distance of the patient's HbA1c from the individualized goal. Other important factors in choosing medication as diabetes progresses include the recognition that there is a diminishing return of glucose-lowering efficacy as add-on agents are introduced, and that the extent of benefit for cardiac and renal protection is not fully understood. In addition, the availability of newer non-insulin agents may distract the clinician from utilizing insulin, the most potent agent available. This goal of this article is to provide a straightforward approach to add-on medication in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, recognizing the limits of polypharmacy and the importance of employing agents best suited to achieving treatment targets. Proposed is a practical tool which provides stepwise guidance, utilizing available data on medication efficacy, while allowing flexibility based on clinician and patient preference.",0
Patient perceptions and experiences with medication-related activities in the emergency department: a qualitative study.,"BACKGROUND: Emergency department (ED) pharmacists reduce medication errors and improve quality of medication use. Patient perceptions and experiences with ED pharmacists have not been studied. The aim of this study was to explore patients' perceptions of and experiences with medication-related activities in the ED, with and without an ED pharmacist present. METHODS: We conducted 24 semistructured individual interviews with patients admitted to one ED in Norway, 12 before and 12 during an intervention, where pharmacists performed medication-related tasks close to patients and in collaboration with ED staff. Interviews were transcribed and analysed applying thematic analysis. RESULTS: From our five developed themes, we identified that: (1) Our informants had low awareness and few expectations of the ED pharmacist, both with and without the pharmacist present. However, they were positive to the ED pharmacist. (2) Our informants expressed a variation of trust in the healthcare system, healthcare professionals and electronic systems, though the majority expressed a high level of trust. They believed that their medication list was automatically updated and assumed to get the correct medication. (3) Some informants felt responsible to have an overview of their medication use, while others expressed low interest in taking responsibility regarding their medication. (4) Some informants did not want involvement from healthcare professionals in medication administration, while others expressed no problems with giving up control. (5) Medication information was important for all informants to feel confident in medication use, but the need for information differed. CONCLUSION: Despite being positive to pharmacists, it did not seem important to our informants who performed the medication-related tasks, as long as they received the help they needed. The degree of trust, responsibility, control and information varied among ED patients. These dimensions can be applied by healthcare professionals to tailor medication-related activities to patients' individual needs.",0
Conceptualizing Person-Centered Care in Elder Mistreatment Intervention: Use of a Well-Being Framework.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Person-centered care (PCC) applied to elder mistreatment interventions is an approach to include victim priorities. Although PCC may improve outcomes by supporting choice, victim preferences are often difficult to support, especially in high-risk situations. We studied the adaptation of PCC structures and process to a pilot intervention, aimed at including client preferences in a multidisciplinary team's plans to address complex elder mistreatment. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Case study analysis was used to examine the process of integrating client priorities into a risk-reduction plan. A well-being framework was used to understand the relationship between safety and preferences. Purposive sampling identified a case study of a high-risk victim with history of refusing help who agreed to work with the Service Advocate, a member of a multidisciplinary team. RESULTS: PCC required a relationship of trust, honed over several weeks by prioritizing the clients' perspective. Client preferences included remaining at home, continuing the relationship with the abuser, and maintaining a sense of mastery. Individualized definitions of ""safety"" were unrelated to elder mistreatment risk. Assistance included working with the suspected perpetrator, which is not offered by most elder mistreatment interventions, and resulted in some risk reduction. Reasons for refusing help were a desire for control and fear of loss of well-being assets. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Individualized definitions of well-being should be considered in measuring intervention success. Future research could determine guidelines on what levels of elder mistreatment risk are acceptable, and how to monitor clients for safety while supporting autonomy.",0
PRO Hair Safe Study: The Patient's Perspective on the Effects of Scalp Cooling on Hair Preservation.,"PURPOSE: Alopecia has been reported a distressing side-effect of chemotherapy for breast cancer patients (BCP) that is highly relevant for quality of life during treatment. For the prevention of chemotherapy-induced alopecia, scalp cooling (SC) has been reported to be an effective and safe intervention. However, data on the patient's perspective on effectiveness and applicability of SC in a clinical routine setting are scarce. In this comparative study, we aimed at a longitudinal assessment of patient-reported outcome (PRO) data on the effect of SC on alopecia and its effect on symptoms and functional health when applied in clinical routine in BCP receiving taxane or anthracycline-based chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study participants were allocated either to the intervention group receiving SC or to the control group based on patient preference (non-randomized study). All patients completed PRO-measures on hair preservation (EORTC Item Library items on hair loss), symptom and functional health measures (EORTC QLQ-C30 and -BR23) and the Body Image Scale (BIS). Outcomes were assessed at chemotherapy start (baseline), mid-chemotherapy, last chemotherapy cycle, 3 months follow-up and 6-9 months follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, we included 113 patients: 75 patients underwent SC (mean age = 51.3 years, 52.7% premenopausal); 38 patients standard care (mean age = 55.6 years, 39.5% premenopausal). A total of 53 patients (70.7%) discontinued SC, with 39 patients (73.5%) stating alopecia as the primary reason. On average, BCP stayed on treatment with the cooling cap for 40.2% of the duration of their chemotherapy (SD 25.3%). In an intention-to-treat analysis, we found no difference between the SC group and the control group with regard to their patient-reported hair loss (p=0.831) across the observation period, overall QOL (p=0.627), emotional functioning (p=0.737), social functioning (p=0.635) and body image (p=0.463) did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION: We found a high rate of SC-decliners and no beneficial effects of SC for patient-reported hair loss, symptoms and functional health. The efficacy and tolerability of SC applied in a clinical routine setting hence appeared to be limited. The further determination and up-front definition of criteria prognostic for effectiveness of SC may be helpful to identify patient subgroups that may experience a treatment benefit.",0
'I feel like they're actually listening to me': a pilot study of a hospital discharge decision-making conversation guide for patients with injection drug use-associated infections.,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of injection drug use (IDU)-associated infections and associated hospitalizations has been increasing for nearly two decades. Due to issues ranging from ongoing substance use to peripherally inserted central catheter safety, many clinicians find discharge decision-making challenging. Typically, clinicians advise patients to remain hospitalized for several weeks for intravenous antimicrobial treatment; however, some patients may desire other antimicrobial treatment options. A structured conversation guide, delivered by infectious disease physicians, intended to inform hospital discharge decisions has the potential to enhance patient participation in decisions. We developed a conversation guide in order to: (1) investigate its feasibility and acceptability and (2) examine experiences, outcomes, and lessons learned from use of the guide. METHODS: We interviewed physicians after they each piloted the conversation guide with two patients. We interviewed patients immediately after the conversation and again 4-6 weeks later. Two analysts indexed transcriptions and used the framework method to identify and organize relevant information. We conducted retrospective chart review to corroborate and contextualize qualitative data. RESULTS: Eight patients and four infectious disease physicians piloted the conversation guide. All patients (N = 8) completed antimicrobial treatment. Nearly all participants believed the conversation guide was important for incorporating patient values and preferences. Patients reported an increased sense of autonomy, but felt post-discharge needs could be better addressed. Physician participants identified the guide's long length and inclusion of pain management as areas for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: A novel conversation guide to inform hospital discharge decision-making for patients with IDU-associated infections was feasible, acceptable, and fostered the incorporation of patient preferences and values into decisions. While we identified areas for improvement, overall participants believed that this novel conversation guide helped to improve patient care and autonomy.",0

Understanding what matters to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients when considering treatment options: A US patient preference survey.,"BACKGROUND: Understanding how patients perceive the efficacy, safety, and administrative burden of treatments for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) can facilitate shared-decision making for optimal management. This study sought to elicit patient preferences for mCRPC treatments in the US. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using the discrete-choice experiment method. Participants were asked to state their choices over successive sets of treatment alternatives, defined by varying levels of treatment attributes: overall survival (OS), months until patients develop a fracture or bone metastasis, likelihood of requiring radiation to control bone pain, fatigue, nausea, and administration (i.e., oral/IV injection/IV infusion). Using mixed logit models, we determined the value (i.e., preference weights) that respondents placed on each attribute. Relative attribute importance (RAI) and marginal rates of substitution (MRS) were calculated to understand patients' willingness to make tradeoffs among different attributes. RESULTS: The final data set numbered 160 participants, with a mean age of 71.6 years old and a mean of 8.96 years since prostate cancer diagnosis. Participants' treatment preferences were as follows: OS (RAI: 31%), bone pain control (23%), nausea (16%), delaying fracture or bone metastasis (15%), fatigue (11%), and administration (3%). The MRS demonstrated that respondents were willing to trade 1.9 months of OS to eliminate moderate nausea and 3.3 months of OS for a reduction in fatigue from severe to mild. CONCLUSIONS: Improving OS is the highest priority for patients with mCRPC, but they are willing to trade some survival to reduce the risk of requiring radiation to control bone pain, delay a fracture or bone metastasis, and experience less severe nausea and fatigue.",1
Best-worst scaling preferences among patients with well-controlled epilepsy: Pilot results.,"Epilepsy is a common, serious condition. Fortunately, seizure risk decreases with increasing seizure-free time on antiseizure medications (ASMs). Eventually, patients may consider whether to stop ASMs, which requires weighing treatment benefit versus burden. We developed a questionnaire to quantify patient preferences relevant to ASM decision-making. Respondents rated how concerning they would finding relevant items (e.g., seizure risks, side effects, cost) on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, 0-100) and then repeatedly chose the most and least concerning item from subsets (best-worst scaling, BWS). We pretested with neurologists, then recruited adults with epilepsy who were seizure-free at least one year. Primary outcomes were recruitment rate, and qualitative and Likert-based feedback. Secondary outcomes included VAS ratings and best-minus-worst scores. Thirty-one of 60 (52%) contacted patients completed the study. Most patients felt VAS questions were clear (28; 90%), easy to use (27; 87%), and assessed preferences well (25; 83%). Corresponding results for BWS questions were 27 (87%), 29 (97%), and 23 (77%). Physicians suggested adding a 'warmup' question showing a completed example and simplifying terminology. Patients suggested ways to clarify instructions. Cost, inconvenience of taking medication, and laboratory monitoring were the least concerning items. Cognitive side effects and a 50% seizure risk in the next year were the most concerning items. Twelve (39%) of patients made at least one 'inconsistent choice' for example ranking a higher seizure risk as lower concern compared with a lower seizure risk, though 'inconsistent choices' represented only 3% of all question blocks. Our recruitment rate was favorable, most patients agreed the survey was clear, and we describe areas for improvement. 'Inconsistent' responses may lead us to collapse seizure probability items into a single 'seizure' category. Evidence regarding how patients weigh benefits and harms may inform care and guideline development.",1

Integrating Precision Medicine into Medical Dermatology Clinical Practice: An Expert Consensus Panel.,"BACKGROUND: Precision medicine utilizes an individual&rsquo;s genomics to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. The joint American Academy of Dermatology and National Psoriasis Foundation 2019 guidelines recognized the need to identify biomarkers that can predict the optimal biologic agent for an individual patient. This paper examines the current state of precision medicine in dermatology and how its use can improve outcomes in psoriasis. METHODS: A search of PubMed/MEDLINE using the terms precision medicine, personalized medicine, biomarkers, genomics, and dermatology was performed to identify relevant publications. An expert consensus panel was then convened to assign levels of evidence to each article using strength of recommendation taxonomy and create consensus statements requiring a two-thirds supermajority for agreement utilizing a modified Delphi approach. RESULTS: Thirteen articles met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were assigned levels of evidence. The panel created 10 consensus statements on how precision medicine can improve patient outcomes, all of which received a unanimous (6/6) vote. CONCLUSION: Choosing a biologic medication for psoriasis often relies on patient preference, provider preference, and a trial-and-error approach. Utilizing precision medicine tests such as Mind.Px can help providers identify biomarkers unique to a patient&rsquo;s pathophysiology and choose the optimal medication through a targeted and evidence-based approach.

Patterns of Health Care Access and Use in an Urban American Indian and Alaska Native Population.,"Studies of health care access and use among historically resilient populations, while common, often field a limited sample size and rarely ask the groups most impacted by health inequities to weigh in. This is especially so for research and programs that focus on the American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) population. The present study addresses this gap by examining data from a cross-sectional survey of AIANs in Los Angeles County. To better interpret project findings and generate culturally relevant contexts, qualitative feedback was gathered at a community forum held in Spring 2018. Because recruitment of AIANs has historically been challenging, purposive sampling was employed to strategically identify a larger eligible pool. Among those who were eligible, 94% completed the survey (n = 496). AIANs who were enrolled in a tribe were 32% more likely to use the Indian Health Service (IHS), compared with those who were not enrolled (95% CI: 20.4%, 43.2%; p < .0001). In multivariable modeling, the strongest factors influencing IHS access and use were: tribal enrollment, preference for culturally-specific health care, proximity of the services to home or work, having Medicaid, and having less than a high school education. Feedback from the community forum indicated cost and trust (of a provider) were important considerations for most AIANs. Study findings reveal heterogeneous patterns of health care access and use in this population, suggesting a need to further improve the continuity, stability, and the image of AIANs' usual sources of care (e.g., IHS, community clinics).",0
Development and Validation of an Educational Book on Self-Management in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Based on Patient Preferences and Expert Opinions: A Methodological Study.,"BACKGROUND: Self-management education resources for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using concepts remain infrequent. We aim to describe the development and evaluation process of educational material for self-management in IBD based on patient preferences and expert opinions. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The method of this study includes two main phases of development and validation in five steps in the following order: (1) identification of information needs for patients with IBD; (2) content development with a comprehensive literature review and scientific texts related to IBD; (3) measuring the face validity of the content based on the expert opinions in the field of IBD; (4) validation of the content with the experts in the field of IBD; and (5) validation by target audiences. RESULTS: The expert panel comprises ten gastroenterologists, nutritionists, psychologists, gynecologists, and nurses. The total suitability score is 79.5%. The final draft version of the educational self-management material was presented to 30 IBD patients who were satisfied (n = 24; 80%) with the material. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the development process and is validated for face and content validity by the academic multidisciplinary expert panel and target group. Patients and their caregivers can use this content to cope with their disease.",0
The Effects of Patient Characteristics on the Management of Subclinical Hypothyroidism: A Survey of Faculty and Trainees.,"OBJECTIVE: There is no universal approach to the management of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). This study was designed to determine the impact of patient characteristics on management decisions in SCH amongst physician faculty members and trainees. METHODS: An online survey was distributed to faculty members and medical trainees (ie, interns, residents, and fellows) at multiple academic medical centers. The survey included 9 clinical scenarios describing women with SCH with 5 management options sequenced from most ""conservative"" (no further treatment or monitoring) to most ""aggressive"" (treatment with levothyroxine). RESULTS: Of the 194 survey respondents, 95 (49.0%) were faculty members and 99 (51.0%) were trainees. Faculty members were more likely to report being ""confident"" or ""very confident"" in making the diagnosis of SCH compared to trainees (95.8% vs 46.5%, P < .001). Faculty members were also more likely to consider patient preference for treatment (60.0% vs 32.3%, P < .001). Among all respondents, the clinical factors that resulted in the highest predicted probability of treatment were hypothyroid symptoms (predicted probability [PP] 68.8%, 95% CI [65.7%-71.9%]), thyroid stimulating hormone >10 mIU/L in a 31-year-old (PP 63.9%, 95% CI [60.3%-67.3%]), and the desire for fertility (PP 52.2%, 95% CI [48.6%-56.0%]). In general, faculty members favored more aggressive treatment across all clinical scenarios. CONCLUSION: The presence of symptoms, thyroid stimulating hormone >10 mIU/L, and desire for fertility were most predictive of the decision to treat in SCH. In several clinical scenarios, both trainee and faculty decision-making demonstrated discordance with general SCH management principles.",0
Patient Preferences in the Management of Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Results of a Multinational Discrete Choice Experiment in Europe.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can lead to a substantial reduction in quality of life. Recent studies revealed high levels of unmet care needs of patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, but their preferences in treatment decision making have scarcely been investigated. This study aimed to reveal which treatment attributes adult patients with HS in Europe consider most important in treatment decision-making. METHODS: A discrete choice experiment was conducted with adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa in Europe to reveal which treatment attributes are most important when making treatment decisions. Participants were presented with 15 sets of two treatment options and asked for each to choose the treatment they preferred. The treatments were characterized by six attributes informed by a prior literature review and qualitative research: effectiveness, pain reduction, duration of treatment benefit, risk of mild adverse event, risk of serious infection, and mode of administration. A random parameter logit model was used to estimate patients' preferences with additional subgroup and latent class models used to explore any differences in preferences across patient groups. RESULTS: Two hundred and nineteen adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa were included in the analysis (90% women, mean age 38 years). For all six treatment attributes, significant differences were observed between levels. Given the range of levels of each attribute, the most important treatment attributes were effectiveness (47.9%), followed by pain reduction (17.3%), annual risk of a mild adverse event (14.4%), annual risk of a serious infection (10.3%), mode of administration (5.3%), and duration of treatment benefit (4.8%). Higher levels of effectiveness, namely a 75% or 100% reduction in the abscess and inflammatory nodule count, were preferred over levels of effectiveness primarily investigated in randomized clinical trials of hidradenitis suppurativa (a 50% reduction). Results were largely consistent across subgroups and three latent class groups were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the most important treatment characteristics for patients with hidradenitis suppurativa that can help inform joint patient-physician decision making in the management of hidradenitis suppurativa. Designing future hidradenitis suppurativa treatments according to stated preferences, namely, to offer higher levels of effectiveness and pain improvement without higher risks of adverse events, may increase patients' treatment concordance and lead to improved disease management outcomes.",1
"Patient preferences, regret, and health-related quality of life among older adults with acute myeloid leukemia: A pilot longitudinal study.","INTRODUCTION: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with poor outcomes and is generally incurable. Therefore, understanding preferences of older adults with AML is critical. We sought to assess whether best-worst scaling (BWS) can be used to capture attributes considered by older adults with AML when making initial treatment decisions and longitudinally, as well as assess changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and decisional regret over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a longitudinal study for adults ≥60 years with newly diagnosed AML, we collected: (1) attributes of treatment most important to patients using BWS, (2) HRQoL using EQ-5D-5L, (3) decisional regret using the Decisional Regret Scale, and (4) treatment worthiness using the ""Was it worth it?"" questionnaire. Data was collected at baseline and over six months. A hierarchical Bayes model was used to allocate percentages out of 100%. Due to small sample size, hypothesis testing was performed at α = 0.10 (2-tailed). We analyzed how these measures differed by treatment choice (intensive vs. lower intensity treatment). RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 76 years (n = 15). At baseline, the most important attributes of treatment to patients were response to treatment (i.e., chance that the cancer will respond to treatment; 20.9%). Compared to those who received lower intensity treatment (n = 7) or best supportive care (n = 2), those who received intensive treatment (n = 6) generally ranked ""alive one year or more after treatment"" (p = 0.03) with higher importance and ranked ""daily activities"" (p = 0.01) and ""location of treatment"" (p = 0.01) with less importance. Overall, HRQoL scores were high. Decisional regret was mild overall and lower for patients who chose intensive treatment (p = 0.06). DISCUSSION: We demonstrated that BWS can be used to assess the importance of various treatment attributes considered by older adults with AML when making initial treatment decisions and longitudinally throughout treatment. Attributes of treatment important to older patients with AML differed between treatment groups and changed over time. Interventions are needed to re-assess patient priorities throughout treatment to ensure care aligns with patient preferences.",1
Comparison of Selective Nerve Root Pulsed Radiofrequency Vs Paramedian Interlaminar Epidural Steroid Injection for the Treatment of Painful Cervical Radiculopathy.,"BACKGROUND: Although there are studies evaluating ultrasound-guided selective nerve root pulsed radiofrequency (ULSD-SNRPRF) and fluoroscopy-guided paramedian cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injection (FL-CIESI) for the treatment of chronic cervical radicular pain, no study has compared the efficacy of these 2 methods. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the efficacy of these 2 methods, their superiority to each other, and the incidence of adverse events. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Outpatient department of a single-center pain clinic. METHODS: Sixty patients who did not respond to conservative treatments for lower cervical radicular pain were randomly divided into 2 groups. One group underwent ULSD-SNRPRF (Group U), and the other underwent paramedian FL-CIESI (Group F). Patients were evaluated pretreatment, and 3 and 6 months posttreatment. The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) was used to assess clinical improvement, The Neck Disability Index (NDI) to assess improvement in functional disability, and the Self-Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs Pain Score (S-LANSS) to assess the treatment's effect on neuropathic pain. Clinically significant pain relief was defined as a 50% or more pain reduction in the NRS-11. The posttreatment reduction in medication consumption was assessed using the Medication Quantification Scale Version III (MQS III). We also evaluated whether there was a difference in treatment-related characteristics, such as procedure time and adverse events. RESULTS: The procedure time was significantly longer in Group U. Blood aspiration was observed in 2 patients in Group U and vascular spread in one patient in Group F, with no significant difference. At 3 and 6 months posttreatment, NRS-11 and NDI scores showed a significant decrease compared to the pretreatment scores in both groups; there was no difference between the groups. Both treatments effectively improved neuropathic pain, with no significant difference between the S-LANSS scores. There was no difference in the reduction of medication consumption between the groups. LIMITATIONS: There was no sham or control group, and the follow-up period was limited to 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Pain relief, functional improvement, and safety were similar between groups. ULSD-SNRPRF and paramedian FL-CIESI are 2 different effective techniques for chronic cervical radicular pain. The choice of method should depend on various factors, such as patient preference, operator experience, and availability of resources. An advantage of ULSD over fluoroscopy is that patients and physicians are not exposed to radiation.",0
Same-day discharge after transvenous lead extraction: feasibility and outcomes.,"AIMS: Same-day discharge (SDD) is safe for patients undergoing electrophysiology procedures. There is no existing data regarding SDD for patients undergoing transvenous lead extraction (TLE). We report our experience with SDD for patients undergoing TLE. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study group included patients undergoing TLE between February 2020 and July 2021 without an infectious indication. A modified SDD protocol for device implants/ablations was applied to TLE patients. Patient characteristics, extraction details, outcomes, and complications were reviewed. Of 239 patients undergoing TLE, 210 were excluded (94 infections and 116 did not meet SDD criteria). Of the remaining 29 patients, seven stayed due to patient preference and 22 were discharged home the same day. The SDD group had an average age of 65.9 ± 12 (47-84), 41% female, and LVEF of 52.2 ± 18% (10-80). The indication for TLE was malfunction (20), upgrade (4), advisory lead (2), and magnetic resonance imaging compatibility (1). Extractions included four implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), 17 pacemakers (PPM), and one cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)-P system. The leads were 9.6 years (1.5-21.7) old, and 1.8 leads were removed per patient (1-3); the lead extraction difficulty (LED) score was 11.6 ± 7. Twenty underwent cardiovascular implantable electronic device (CIED) re-implantation (2 ICD, 3 CRT-D, 13 PPM, and 2 CRT-P). For CIED re-implants, patients sent a remote transmission the next day, and all patients received a next-day call. There were no procedure or device-related issues, morbidities, or mortalities in the 30 days after discharge. CONCLUSION: Same-day discharge after TLE for non-infectious aetiologies is safe and feasible in a select group of patients with early procedure completion who meet strict SDD criteria.",0
"Exploring international differences in ovarian cancer care: a survey report on global patterns of care, current practices, and barriers.","OBJECTIVE: Although global disparities in survival rates for patients with ovarian cancer have been described, variation in care has not been assessed globally. This study aimed to evaluate global ovarian cancer care and barriers to care. METHODS: A survey was developed by international ovarian cancer specialists and was distributed through networks and organizational partners of the International Gynecologic Cancer Society, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology, and the European Society of Gynecological Oncology. Respondents received questions about care organization. Outcomes were stratified by World Bank Income category and analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regressions. RESULTS: A total of 1059 responses were received from 115 countries. Respondents were gynecological cancer surgeons (83%, n=887), obstetricians/gynecologists (8%, n=80), and other specialists (9%, n=92). Income category breakdown was as follows: high-income countries (46%), upper-middle-income countries (29%), and lower-middle/low-income countries (25%). Variation in care organization was observed across income categories. Respondents from lower-middle/low-income countries reported significantly less frequently that extensive resections were routinely performed during cytoreductive surgery. Furthermore, these countries had significantly fewer regional networks, cancer registries, quality registries, and patient advocacy groups. However, there is also scope for improvement in these components in upper-middle/high-income countries. The main barriers to optimal care for the entire group were patient co-morbidities, advanced presentation, and social factors (travel distance, support systems). High-income respondents stated that the main barriers were lack of surgical time/staff and patient preferences. Middle/low-income respondents additionally experienced treatment costs and lack of access to radiology/pathology/genetic services as main barriers. Lack of access to systemic agents was reported by one-third of lower-middle/low-income respondents. CONCLUSIONS: The current survey report highlights global disparities in the organization of ovarian cancer care. The main barriers to optimal care are experienced across all income categories, while additional barriers are specific to income levels. Taking action is crucial to improve global care and strive towards diminishing survival disparities and closing the care gap.",0
A new wearable diagnostic home sleep testing platform: comparison with available systems and benefits of multinight assessments.,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: We assessed the real-world performance of the ANNE Sleep system against 2 Food and Drug Administration-cleared home sleep testing platforms and the intraindividual night-to-night variability of respiratory event index measured by ANNE Sleep. METHODS: We evaluated the home performance of the ANNE Sleep system compared with 2 Food and Drug Administration-cleared home sleep testing platforms (WatchPAT: n = 29 and Alice NightOne: n = 46) during a synchronous night with unsupervised patient application. Additionally, we evaluated night-to-night variability of respiratory event index and total sleep time using the ANNE Sleep system (n = 30). RESULTS: For the diagnosis of moderate and severe obstructive sleep apnea, the ANNE Sleep system had a positive percent agreement of 58% (95% confidence interval, 28-85%) and a negative percent agreement of 100% (95% confidence interval, 80-100%) compared to WatchPAT. The positive and negative percent agreement for ANNE Sleep vs Alice NightOne was 85% (95% confidence interval, 66-96%) and 95% (95% confidence interval, 74-100%). There were no differences in mean total sleep time or respiratory event index across multiple nights of monitoring with ANNE. There were no differences consistent with a first-night effect but testing multiple nights reclassified obstructive sleep apnea severity in 5 (17%) individuals and detected 3 additional cases of moderate disease, with only a 12% (standard deviation, 28%) mean fluctuation in respiratory event index from the first night of testing compared to a mean of multiple nights. Overall, 80% of users found ANNE comfortable and easy to use. CONCLUSIONS: ANNE Sleep exhibited stronger concordance with Alice NightOne compared to WatchPAT. While we illustrated low night-to-night variability for ANNE Sleep, the results suggest multiple nights increased detection of moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea.

Surgical Outcomes Following Vestibular Schwannoma Resection in Patients over the Age of Sixty-five.,"Objective  Vestibular schwannoma (VS) are benign, often slow growing neoplasms. Some institutions opt for radiosurgery in symptomatic patients of advanced age versus surgical resection. The aim of the study is to analyze surgical outcomes of VS in patients over the age of 65 who were either not candidates for or refused radiosurgery. Methods  This includes retrospective analysis of VS patients between 1988 and 2020. Demographics, tumor characteristics, surgical records, and clinical outcomes were recorded. Patient preference for surgery over radiosurgery was recorded in the event that patients were offered both. Facial nerve outcomes were quantified using House-Brackmann (HB) scores. Tumor growth was defined by increase in size of >2 mm. Results  In total, 64 patients were included of average age 72.4 years (65-84 years). Average maximum tumor diameter was 29 mm (13-55 mm). Forty-five patients were offered surgery or GKRS, and chose surgery commonly due to radiation aversion (48.4%). Gross total resection was achieved in 39.1% ( n  = 25), near total 32.8% ( n  = 21), and subtotal 28.1% ( n  = 18). Average hospitalization was 5 days [2-17] with 75% ( n  = 48) discharged home. Postoperative HB scores were good (HB1-2) in 43.8%, moderate (HB3-4) in 32.8%, and poor (HB5-6) in 23.4%. HB scores improved to good in 51.6%, moderate in 31.3%, and remained poor in 17.1%, marking a rate of facial nerve improvement of 10.9%. Tumor control was achieved in 95.3% of cases at an average follow-up time of 37.8 months. Conclusion  VS resection can be safely performed in patients over the age of 65. Advanced age should not preclude a symptomatic VS patient from being considered for surgical resection.",0
Patient preferences regarding treatment options for Waldenström's macroglobulinemia: A discrete choice experiment.,"INTRODUCTION: Treatment options for Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM) have expanded rapidly in the last decades. However, there is no consensus on a preferred treatment. Therefore, patient preferences become increasingly important in making individualized treatment plans. Still, WM patients' priorities and perspectives regarding their treatment options are unknown. We evaluated treatment preferences of WM patients using a discrete choice experiment (DCE). METHODS: A mixed-method approach was utilized for identification and selection of attributes/levels. The DCE questionnaire included five attributes: type of agent (targeted versus chemotherapy); frequency and route of administration; 5-year progression-free survival (PFS); adverse events; and risk of secondary malignancies. An orthogonal design and a mixed logit panel data model were used to construct choice tasks and assess patient preferences, respectively. RESULTS: Three hundred thirty WM patients participated in the project. In total, 214 (65%) complete questionnaires were included for data analysis. The 5-year PFS, followed by risk of secondary malignancies were the most important attributes for making treatment choices. Regarding side effects, patients chose to avoid neuropathy the most compared to nausea/vomiting and extreme fatigue. Patients preferred a fixed-duration treatment with IV/SC administration at the hospital over a continuous daily oral regimen at home. CONCLUSION: These are the first systematic data obtained on WM patient preferences for treatment. The results may help discussions with individual patients about their treatment choices. Also, these data can help design clinical trials in WM and inform health-care decision-making regarding outcomes that are most relevant to patients.",1
Assessment of neophallus length following metoidioplasty.,"BACKGROUND: An increasing number of gender diverse individuals are presenting for gender affirming care. An option for genital gender affirming surgery (gGAS) in transmasculine individuals is metoidioplasty, creating a small neophallus from enlarged clitoral tissue following prolonged testosterone exposure. The goal of this study is to understand factors which contribute to greater exposed neophallus length following metoidioplasty. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review on patients presenting to a single academic institution who underwent a metoidioplasty. All operations were performed using the Belgrade technique with or without urethral lengthening depending on patient preference. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients underwent metoidioplasty from 2017-2022. Sixteen had recorded stretched clitoral length (pre-operatively) and exposed neophallus length (post-operatively). The median length of time on testosterone therapy was 4.6 years. The median stretched clitoral length was 5.8 cm, and exposed neophallus length was 6 cm. There was a strong correlation between pre-operative length and post-operative length (ρ=0.9; P<0.0001). There were no correlations between pre-operative length or exposed neophallus length and BMI (ρ=-0.02, P=0.93; ρ=0.05, P=0.83, respectively). Time on testosterone does not correlate with stretched clitoral length nor exposed neophallus length (ρ=-0.28, P=0.15; ρ=-0.35, P=0.18, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients considering metoidioplasty often wonder how large their neophallus will be. We found that patients can expect exposed neophallus length to be about 0.6 cm longer than their pre-operative stretched clitoral length. No evidence of association of time on testosterone nor BMI with exposed neophallus length was found. This information is crucial for gender diverse patients to make informed decisions about gGAS.",0
"Wire-Free, Nonradioactive Localization Techniques to Guide Surgical Excision of Nonpalpable Breast Tumours: A Health Technology Assessment.","BACKGROUND: The current standard treatment for nonpalpable breast tumours is surgical excision; however, it is nearly impossible to locate these small masses during surgery. Therefore, a marker must be implanted into the abnormal tissue under mammography or ultrasound guidance prior to surgery to guide the surgeon to the location of the tumour. Two techniques to localize nonpalpable breast tumours are currently used in Ontario: wire-guided localization and radioactive seed localization.However, these techniques have some limitations. New wire-free, nonradioactive technologies that address these limitations are now available. We conducted a health technology assessment of wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques available in Canada that are used to localize nonpalpable breast tumours for surgical excision. This report includes an evaluation of the effectiveness, safety, and budget impact of publicly funding these techniques, as well as an evaluation of patient preferences and values. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of the clinical evidence. We assessed the risk of bias of each included study using the ROBINS-I tool and the quality of the body of evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. We performed a systematic economic literature search, and we analyzed the budget impact of publicly funding wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques to guide surgical excision of nonpalpable breast tumours in Ontario. We did not conduct a primary economic evaluation because of the limited data available to use as model inputs. To contextualize the potential value of wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques, we spoke with people who had undergone a localization procedure for the surgical excision of a nonpalpable breast tumour. RESULTS: We included 16 studies in the clinical evidence review, of which 15 were comparative studies and one was a single-arm study. The results of our analysis of the comparative studies suggest that the re-excision rate for the wire-guided, nonradioactive devices included in this review is either lower or not different from the rate for conventional localization methods (GRADE: Moderate/Low). We found no difference in postoperative complications or operation time between the new and the conventional techniques (GRADE: Moderate). In a feasibility study of a newly developed magnetic seed device in Ontario, no patient required re-excision (GRADE: not assessed). Our economic evidence review identified two costing studies that found that wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques were more expensive than wire-guided and radioactive seed localization. We were unable to identify any published cost-effectiveness evidence for wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques. The annual budget impact of publicly funding wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques in Ontario over the next 5 years ranges from an additional $0.51 million in year 1 to an additional $2.61 million in year 5, for a total 5-year budget impact of $7.73 million. The people we spoke with who had undergone a localization procedure reported valuing surgical interventions that are clinically effective, timely, and patient centred. They responded positively to the potential public funding of wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques and felt that equitable access should be a requirement of implementation. CONCLUSIONS: The wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques included in this review are effective and safe methods for the localization of nonpalpable breast tumours and are reasonable alternatives to wire-guided and radioactive seed localization. We estimate that publicly funding wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques in Ontario would result in an additional cost of $7.73 million over the next 5 years. Broad access to wire-free, nonradioactive localization techniques may have a positive impact on patients undergoing surgical excision for a nonpalpable breast tumour. People with lived experience of a localization procedure value surgical interventions that are clinically effective, timely, and patient centred. They also value equitable access to surgical care.",0
Patients' willingness to accept adverse event and cost tradeoffs from oral nicotinamide for reduced risk of non-melanoma skin cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Non-immunosuppressed patients with a history of multiple non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) taking oral nicotinamide supplementation experienced a 23% decrease in annual NMSC risk in a randomized clinical trial. Patient preferences for risks and costs associated with nicotinamide are unknown. OBJECTIVES: To understand how patients prioritize NMSC reduction, infection risk, and cost. METHODS: A sample of adults with history of ≥2 NMSC within the past five years undergoing Mohs procedure completed a discrete-choice experiment comprising two hypothetical treatments-characterized by varying reductions in NMSC incidence, increased severe infection risk, and cost-and no treatment. The data were analyzed with random-parameters logit models. RESULTS: A total of 203 subjects (mean age 71.5 years, 65.5% males) participated. For a 23% annual reduction in NMSC incidence, a 26% [95% CI: 8%-45%] annual increase in severe infection risk and $8 [95% CI: $2-14] monthly cost was acceptable. Outcomes across analyzed subgroups (before vs. during COVID pandemic, site of interview, less vs. more prior NMSCs) were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Patients were unwilling to accept high severe infection risks to obtain the reduction in NMSC incidence observed in a nicotinamide trial, suggesting that routinely recommending nicotinamide may run counter to some patients' preferences.",1
"A discrete choice experiment to elicit preferences for a chronic disease screening programme in Queensland, Australia.","OBJECTIVE: Patient-centred care, increasingly highlighted in healthcare strategies, necessitates understanding public preferences for healthcare service attributes. We aimed to understand the preferences of the Australian population regarding the attributes of chronic disease screening programmes. STUDY DESIGN: The preferences were elicited using the discrete choice experiment (DCE) methodology. METHODS: A DCE was administered to a sample of the Australian general population. Respondents were asked to make choices, each offering two hypothetical screening scenarios defined by screening conduct, quality and accuracy of the test results, cost to the patient, wait time and source of information. Data were analysed using a panel mixed multinomial logit model. RESULTS: A strong preference for highly accurate screening tests and nurse-led screenings at local health clinics was evident. They expressed disutility for waiting time and out-of-pocket costs but were indifferent about the source of information. Their preference for a nurse-led programme was highlighted by the fact that they were willing to pay $81 and $88 to get a nurse-led programme when they were offered a general practitioner-led and a specialist-led programme, respectively. Furthermore, they were willing to pay $32 to reduce a week of waiting time and $205 for a 95% accurate test compared to a 75% accurate test. Preferences remained consistent irrespective of the respondent's place of residence. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of diagnostic test accuracy and nurse-led service delivery in chronic disease screening programmes. These insights could guide the development of patient-centric services by enhancing test accuracy, reducing waiting times and promoting nurse-led care models.",1
Factors that influence preference for male or female urologist among underserved patients in New York City.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of patient preference for male or female urologic provider and explore which patient characteristics influence this preference. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After obtaining hospital Institutional Review Board approval, a 14-question survey in English and Spanish was administered across four general urology clinic sites in a single hospital system in New York City. The survey asked demographic questions and preference for a male or a female urologist. The survey included questions pertaining to the nature of the clinic visit and subsequent provider preference as well. Statistics were performed using Stata 16 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). RESULTS: A total of 540 patients completed the 14-question survey. The vast majority of survey respondents identified as male (90%). The largest proportion demographic groups were those aged 41-60 (47%), Hispanic or Latino (43%), Catholic (47%), unemployed (40%) and those with a high school level of education (34%). Most patients (60%) did not have a preference for a specific gender provider, whereas 37% preferred a male provider, and 3% preferred a female provider. On univariate analysis, patient age 25-40, less than high school education level and lack of employment were significant predictors of provider gender preference (p < 0.05), with most patients indicating a male provider preference. On multivariate analysis of gender, age, education level and employment status, gender and education level were not significant predictors of preference, whereas age 25-40 and being unemployed were significant predictors (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Patient gender, race and religion do not appear to influence their preference to be seen by a male or a female urologist in the clinic setting. However, patient age, unemployment and potentially educational attainment were significantly associated with a provider gender preference.",0
Incorporating patient preferences and burden-of-disease in evaluating ALS drug candidate AMX0035: a Bayesian decision analysis perspective.,"OBJECTIVE: Provide US FDA and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) society with a systematic, transparent, and quantitative framework to evaluate the efficacy of the ALS therapeutic candidate AMX0035 in its phase 2 trial, which showed statistically significant effects (p-value 3%) in slowing the rate of ALS progression on a relatively small sample size of 137 patients. METHODS: We apply Bayesian decision analysis (BDA) to determine the optimal type I error rate (p-value) under which the clinical evidence of AMX0035 supports FDA approval. Using rigorous estimates of ALS disease burden, our BDA framework strikes the optimal balance between FDA's need to limit adverse effects (type I error) and patients' need for expedited access to a potentially effective therapy (type II error). We apply BDA to evaluate long-term patient survival based on clinical evidence from AMX0035 and Riluzole. RESULTS: The BDA-optimal type I error for approving AMX0035 is higher than the 3% p-value reported in the phase 2 trial if the probability of the therapy being effective is at least 30%. Assuming a 50% probability of efficacy and a signal-to-noise ratio of treatment effect between 25% and 50% (benchmark: 33%), the optimal type I error rate ranges from 2.6% to 26.3% (benchmark: 15.4%). The BDA-optimal type I error rate is robust to perturbations in most assumptions except for a probability of efficacy below 5%. CONCLUSION: BDA provides a useful framework to incorporate subjective perspectives of ALS patients and objective burden-of-disease metrics to evaluate the therapeutic effects of AMX0035 in its phase 2 trial.",1
Long-term oncological outcomes after local excision of T1 rectal cancer.,"BACKGROUND: A growing proportion of patients with early rectal cancer is treated by local excision only. The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term oncological outcomes and the impact of local recurrence on overall survival for surgical local excision in pT1 rectal cancer. METHODS: Patients who only underwent local excision for pT1 rectal cancer between 1997 and 2014 in two Dutch tertiary referral hospitals were included in this retrospective cohort study. The primary outcome was the local recurrence rate. Secondary outcomes were distant recurrence, overall survival and the impact of local recurrence on overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients (mean age 68.5 ± 10.7 years, 57.3% males) were included in the study. Median length of follow-up was 58.9 months (range 6-176 months). Local recurrence occurred in 22.7% (n = 34) of the patients, with a median time to local recurrence of 11.1 months (range 2.3-82.6 months). The vast majority of local recurrences were located in the lumen. Five-year overall survival was 82.0%, and landmark analyses showed that local recurrence significantly impacted overall survival at 6 and 36 months of follow-up (6 months, p = 0.034, 36 months, p = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Local recurrence rates after local excision of early rectal cancer can be substantial and may impact overall survival. Therefore, clinical decision-making should be based on patient- and tumour characteristics and should incorporate patient preferences.",0
"Values and preferences of health care professionals, policy-makers, patients and family members regarding recommendations of adapted physical restraint guidelines in critical care: A survey research.","BACKGROUND: The values and preferences of stakeholders are crucial in the development of guidelines. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate stakeholders' values and preferences regarding draft recommendations for adapted physical restraint guidelines in China. STUDY DESIGN: This survey research was carried out at four university-affiliated comprehensive hospitals based in the eastern, central, western, and north eastern zones of China from January 5-30, 2022. A 48-item self-report questionnaire was distributed, and values and preferences were assessed on a 10-point Likert scale. One-way ANOVA was used to compare values and preference scores among stakeholders. As effect-size measures, partial η(2) and Cohen's f values are reported for ANOVA results. RESULTS: A total of 1155 stakeholders were enrolled in the study. The mean value and preference scores were higher than seven for 46 draft recommendations. There was either no significant difference in the values and preferences of the stakeholders for the draft recommendations or there was a significant difference (p values ranged from <0.001 ∼ .048), but the effect size was small or very small (partial η(2) value ranged from 0.011 ∼ .044; Cohen's f value ranged from 0.101 ∼ .214). The mean scores of patients for items related to cyber therapy and early tracheotomy were 6.84 and 6.60, respectively, which were lower than those of family members, policy-makers, and health care professionals and were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The partial η(2) and Cohen's f values of the effect size were 0.083/0.062 and 0.302/0.256, respectively, which indicated that the differences were moderate. CONCLUSION: These recommendations were in line with the values and preferences of stakeholders. Patients were more supportive of implementing cyber therapy or hypnosis for pain management but did not support early tracheotomy to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation. Guideline panels could use value and preference information to revise and endorse recommendations of adapted physical restraint guidelines in critical care. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Practitioners should implement recommendations based on the values and preferences of stakeholders.",0

Eliciting preferences in glaucoma management-a systematic review of stated-preference studies.,"BACKGROUND: In most cases, glaucoma patients require long-term medical and/or surgical treatment. Preference studies investigate how different aspects of glaucoma management, such as health or process outcomes, are valued and herewith help stakeholders make care more responsive to patients' needs. As, to our knowledge, no overview of these studies is currently available, this study aims to systematically review and critically appraise these studies. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using keywords for stated-preference studies and glaucoma up to October 2021. Studies were included if they were original research and used a stated-preference methodology to investigate preferences in patients or healthcare professionals for different aspects of glaucoma management. Data were extracted and summarized. Furthermore, a quality appraisal of the included studies was performed using two validated checklists. RESULTS: The search yielded 1214 articles after removal of duplicates. Of those, 11 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Studies aimed to elicit preferences for glaucoma treatment (27%), glaucoma related health state valuation (36%), and services (36%) from the patient (91%) or ophthalmologists' perspective (9%). Altogether studies included 69 attributes. The majority of attributes were outcome related (62%), followed by process (32%) and cost attributes (6%). Outcome attributes (e.g., effectiveness) were most often of highest importance to the population. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides an up-to-date and critical review of stated-preference studies in the field of glaucoma, suggesting that patients have preferences and are willing to trade-off between characteristics, and revealed that outcome attributes are the most influential characteristics of glaucoma management.",1
Barriers to the use of clinical practice guidelines: a qualitative study of Danish physiotherapists and chiropractors.,"PURPOSE: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Providing evidence-based practice (EBP) for patients with LBP is more cost-effective compared with non-EBP. To help health care professionals provide EBP, several clinical practice guidelines have been published. However, a relatively poor uptake of the guidelines has been identified across various countries. To enhance future implementation of EBP, the aim of this study was to explore barriers to using LBP guidelines in clinical practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A qualitative constructivist grounded theory design was employed in order to gain an in-depth understanding of the barriers. Semi-structured interviews (+/- observations) of nine physiotherapists and nine chiropractors from primary care in the Central Denmark Region were conducted. RESULTS: Two key barriers were found to using guidelines in practice: (1) a scepticism due to doubts about validity and applicability of the guidelines, which emerged particularly among physiotherapists; and (2) a deep biomechanical professional identity, due to perceived role, interest, lack of skills, and patient preferences, which emerged particularly among chiropractors. CONCLUSIONS: For guidelines to be better implemented in practice, these key barriers must be addressed in a tailored strategy. Furthermore, this study showed a difference in barriers between the two professions.",0
